If your dataset involves DIA and DDA data, it is recommended to submit them in different submissions.\n\nThe files required for the partial submission are the RAW data (instrument raw data files) and the SEARCH file (peptide results analysis). You can also upload any additional files that have more information about the metadata, the DIA analysis, or the downstream analysis. Examples of such additional files include SDRF-Proteomics files (Sample and Data Relationship Files), which contain additional annotations, including the mapping between the samples analyzed and the data files deposited.\n\nAfter the submission and post-submission steps, the PRIDE team can attach additional files to the dataset to help users understand, retrieve, and reuse them without modifying the original submitted files. These additional files may include mzTab files exported from mzIdentML files, and as other files, it can include SWATH assay libraries, file describing SWATH windows setup, iRT peptide SWATH assays file, and Build Peptide Search Library (blib file) from Skyline.\n\nPlease note that the PRIDE team can provide additional file upload details through the PRIDE Archive web site (<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive>) if you need to add additional RAW files and accompanying RESULT or SEARCH files, or if you have used the PX Submission Tool and need to add additional files.

To submit a dataset to PRIDE, there are two types of submissions: complete and partial.\n\nComplete submissions ensure that the processed results (including identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE. To achieve this, processed identification results need to be provided in a PSI open standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab). Submitters should follow the PRIDE data policy, which states that all datasets submitted to PRIDE are private by default and can remain private for up to 2 years after being submitted. Once a dataset is released to the public, it can be modified, but this should be done with caution and only after the submitter requests it.\n\nPartial submissions provide processed identification results in other data formats than those indicated above for complete submissions. Submitters can access their own private datasets by using their PRIDE username and password, and additional usernames and passwords are provided to journal editors and reviewers during the manuscript review process.\n\nIn general, submitters of proteomics datasets to PRIDE should be aware of the following aspects of our data policy:\n\n* The PRIDE database has a uniform policy of free and unrestricted access to all the datasets deposited once they are released to the public.\n* Dataset licenses for PRIDE datasets are under the Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0) License, and all submitters have specifically agreed to these terms during the submission process.\n* PRIDE will automatically release datasets to the public upon notification of the corresponding publication, but this can be up to 2 years after submission.\n* Private datasets can be modified before they are released to the public, but this should be done with caution.\n* Public datasets should not be modified unless it is really unavoidable, based on exceptional reasons.\n* Submitters should make sure that the data included in a dataset is consistent, valuable, and correct before it is released to the public.\n* Datasets can be released as public or as a combination of public and private datasets.\n* The PRIDE team can attach additional files to a dataset to help users understand, retrieve, and reuse them, but these files do not modify the original submitted files in any way.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on the PRIDE data policy or dataset submissions, you can contact the PRIDE team at [ contact@PRIDE.ac.uk](mailto:contact@PRIDE.ac.uk).",

        "answer_a": "Sure, I can help with that!\n\nIn PRIDE (ProteomeXchange), there are two types of submitted datasets: complete and partial.\n\nA complete submission ensures that the processed results (at least the identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE. To achieve this, processed identification results need to be provided in a PSI open standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab). Examples include bottom-up DDA datasets where identification results were generated from any tool that can export the data standard mzIdentML (and the corresponding peak list files).\n\nA partial submission, on the other hand, does not provide the complete processed results and corresponding mass spectra. However, all the submitted files are made available to download. This mechanism allows data generated from any software that cannot export it to the supported formats or from less-mature/novel proteomics experimental approaches to be deposited in PRIDE. Examples include bottom-up DDA datasets where identification results were generated from any tool that cannot export the PSI data standards mzIdentML or mzTab, or other datasets coming from approaches where no open standard for the results currently has been implemented.\n\nTo submit your dataset, you first need to download the PX Submission Tool. The PX Submission Tool guides the users through the submission process, generating at the end the submission.px file. This file contains two types of crucial information: metadata (required experimental metadata like experiment description, sample taxonomy information, instruments, and protein modifications used) and mappings between the uploaded files (for example, between the RAW files and the corresponding 'RESULT' or search engine output ('SEARCH') files).\n\nOnce you have all the necessary files ready, you can submit the dataset using the Aspera (by default) or FTP file transfer protocols provided by the PX Submission Tool.\n\nIn the submission details, users are asked to provide some basic details about the uploaded dataset, such as the title, a list of keywords, a brief description of the dataset, sample processing, and data processing protocol. Additionally, users have to pick a mass spectrometry experiment type from a drop-down menu.",

This option is useful for data generated from software that cannot export the PSI data standards or from less-mature/novel proteomics experimental approaches.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n* Complete submission: Use PSI open standard formats like mzIdentML or mzTab for identification results and peak lists. PRIDE can parse, integrate, and visualize the data.\n* Partial submission: Use other data formats. PRIDE cannot parse, integrate, or visualize the data, but all files are made available for download.\n\nDo you have any other questions?",

If a manuscript contains data coming from different proteomics workflows, it is recommended to split the data into different datasets for easier interpretation. The dataset should include metadata such as the title, keywords, description, sample processing, and data processing protocol. Users have to select a mass spectrometry experiment type from a drop-down menu. Complete submissions ensure that the processed results (at least the identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE. Partial submissions provide processed identification results in other data formats than those indicated for complete submissions.",

Ensure that your dataset corresponds to the data described in a single manuscript, and that all data comes from the same data workflow (e.g., Data Dependent Acquisition, DDA). If your dataset includes data from different workflows, it is recommended to split the data into different datasets.\n2. Provide additional metadata, such as the title, keywords, brief description, sample processing, and data processing protocol.\n3. Choose a mass spectrometry experiment type from a drop-down menu.\n4. Ensure that your processed identification results are provided in a PSI open standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab) for a complete submission, or in other data formats for a partial submission.\n5. Submit your dataset to PRIDE.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. If I don't know the answer, I will say \"I don't know.\"",

        "answer_b": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n### Question: What constitutes a PRIDE dataset?\n\nA PRIDE dataset is a collection of data that corresponds to a single manuscript and comes from the same data workflow, such as Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) or Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM). If a manuscript contains data from different proteomics workflows, it is recommended to split the data into different datasets for easier interpretation by third parties. However, the submitter has the final decision on how to organize their submitted datasets, which may depend on various factors such as future publications.\n\n### Question: Accessing private data\n\nSubmitted datasets are private by default, and you need to be logged in to view them. During the submission process, a reviewer account is created for the dataset, which can be included in the letter to the editor or the actual manuscript. This account gives access to all the files included in the dataset. You can access private dataset files in two ways:\n\n### Question: Making the data public\n\nTo make the data public, you can choose to make the dataset public during the submission process. This will make all the files in the dataset publicly available, and they can be searched and accessed by anyone. Alternatively, you can choose to keep the dataset private and only share it with approved users.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
