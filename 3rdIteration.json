Once your dataset is published, you can search for the PubMed ID by searching for the title or accession number of the dataset in PubMed. If the data has already been published, it should be listed under the \"First 2000 results (max)\". If not, you can create a new PubMed record for your dataset by going to the \"Views\" tab and selecting \"Create a new publication\". In the \"Details\" section, you can add a PubMed ID to your dataset.",

However, it is important to note that PRIDE has specific guidelines for submitting DIA data, and these guidelines must be followed in order for the submission to be successful.\n\nTo submit a DIA submission as a complete submission, you will need to provide all of the required metadata and file information for your submission. This includes information about your experiment, such as the sample taxonomy, instruments used, and protein modifications. You will also need to provide mappings between the uploaded files, such as between the RAW files and the corresponding 'RESULT' or search engine output files.\n\nOnce you have gathered all of the necessary information and files, you can use the PRIDE Submission Tool to submit your dataset. The PRIDE Submission Tool is a wizard-based tool that guides you through the submission process, and it supports both Aspera and FTP file transfer protocols.\n\nIf you have any questions or issues during the submission process, you can consult the PRIDE General Help Pages or contact the PRIDE support team for assistance.\n\nI hope this helps!

This is achieved by providing processed identification results in a PSI open standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab). Examples include bottom-up DDA datasets where identification results were generated from any tool that can export the data standard mzIdentML (and the corresponding peak list files).\n\n         Partial submissions, on the other hand, provide processed identification results in other data formats that PRIDE cannot parse, integrate, or visualize. However, all submitted files are made available for download. This mechanism allows data generated from any software that cannot export to the supported formats or from less-mature/novel proteomics experimental approaches to be deposited in PRIDE.

How can I access and download individual datasets in PRIDE?\n\nTo access and download individual datasets in PRIDE, you need to be a registered submitter and log in to your personal account or the reviewer account generated for the dataset you want to access. Once logged in, you can access and download the private datasets listed under your account.\n\n\n2. How can I download data using the PRIDE Streaming API?\n\nThe PRIDE Streaming API allows you to download data from PRIDE using a single endpoint: <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive-file-downloader/files/s3/<project accession>/<filename>>. You can also use the command line tool wget to download files.\n\n\n3. How can I export the summary and checksum file with the PRIDE Submission Tool?\n\nTo export the summary and checksum file with the PRIDE Submission Tool, you need to install the latest PRIDE Submission Tool from the PRIDE web page. Once you upload your data, the checksum.txt file will automatically be downloaded to your PRIDE Submission Tool folder. Then, you can find the summary/submission.px file in the top right corner of the PRIDE Submission Tool and export it.\n\n\n4. How do I register as a user in PRIDE?\n\nTo register as a user in PRIDE, you need to go to the PRIDE web page and click on the \"Register\" button. Currently, PRIDE does not send out automatic emails upon successful registration, so please contact pride-support@ebi.ac.uk if your login information is not valid after 24 hours following registration.\n\n\nAs for your final question, \"How can I manually upload to PRIDE?\", I don't think it's possible to manually upload data to PRIDE without using the PRIDE Submission Tool or the PRIDE Streaming API.

If you encounter any issues, you can always switch back to Aspera by changing the line back to \u00e2\u0080\u0098px.upload.protocol = aspera\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\nNote that Aspera is a faster file transfer protocol than FTP, especially over longer distances. However, if you prefer to use FTP for some reason, this change should allow you to do so.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Keep in mind that it is highly recommended to calculate the checksum to ensure the integrity of your files, but if the files are very large, you can skip this step to avoid delays. Once you press \"Next,\" you will be able to proceed with the submission process without calculating the checksums.\n\n         Additionally, if you encounter delays during the checksum calculation stage, you can try the following:\n\n         Ensure that you have write access to the directory where you are using the tool, as the checksum file is generated within that directory.\n\n         If your files are large or your submission comprises a significant number of files, the checksum calculation process may take a considerable amount of time. Please be patient and allow the process to complete.\n\n         If you are still experiencing issues, you may want to try annotating your files before submitting them. This is the final step of the annotation process and can be a complex task, but it is important to ensure that your files are properly annotated before submitting them.\n\n         I hope this helps!

What happens to my data after upload?\n\nAfter you upload your data, a curator will perform an initial assessment of the dataset, including the PRIDE Validation pipeline. If the data validation is successful, the submission will be performed, and you will receive an email with the dataset identifier and reviewer's credentials. Please note that PRIDE receives high numbers of submitted datasets every day, so the processing of your dataset can take up to 5 working days, although it may happen earlier than that.\n\n2. The submission tool or PX tool is not launching. What should I do?\n\nIf the submission tool or PX tool is not launching, you can try the following:\n\na. Check if you have the latest version of the tool. You can check for updates on the PRIDE website.\n\nb. Make sure you have the necessary software installed, such as Java or Python.\n\nc.

This number will be included in any email communication with PRIDE. You can also check the status of your submission on the PRIDE website.\n\n5. What is the difference between Aspera and FTP transfer protocols?\n\nAspera is a faster file transfer protocol than FTP, typically up to 50 times faster. Aspera functionality usually provides much faster file transfer speeds than FTP. However, if there are any issues with the Aspera upload, the tool will automatically try to perform the file upload using FTP.\n\n6. Can I submit my dataset using FTP instead of Aspera?\n\nYes, you can submit your dataset using FTP instead of Aspera. If there are any issues with the Aspera upload, the tool will automatically try to perform the file upload using FTP.\n\n7. How do I know if my dataset has been validated successfully?\n\nAfter your dataset has been validated, you will receive an email with the dataset identifier and reviewer's credentials. You can also check the status of your submission on the PRIDE website.\n\n8.

        "answer_b": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n\n1. How long does it take to get a PRIDE accession number?\n\nThe time it takes to receive a PRIDE accession number can vary depending on the volume of submissions PRIDE receives. However, based on the information provided, it may take up to 5 working days for your dataset to be processed after submission.\n\n\n2. Can I log in with my PRIDE account to access the PRIDE Archive web page?\n\nYes, you can log in with your PRIDE account to access the PRIDE Archive web page. To do so, you can visit the PRIDE Archive web page and enter your registered email address and password.\n\n\n3. How do I create a PRIDE account?\n\nTo create a PRIDE account, you can visit the PRIDE registration page and fill out the required information. Please note that PRIDE does not send out automatic emails upon successful registration, so you may need to contact pride-support@ebi.ac.uk if your login information is not valid after 24 hours following registration.\n\n\n4. What happens to my data after I upload it to PRIDE?\n\nAfter you upload your dataset to PRIDE, a curator will perform an initial assessment of the dataset, including PRIDE Validation pipeline. If the data validation is successful, the submission is performed, and you will receive an email including the dataset identifier and reviewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credentials.\n\n\n5. Can I use my PRIDE account to access and download individual datasets?\n\nYes, registered submitters can use their personal accounts or the reviewer accounts to access and download the individual datasets. For every submitted dataset, there is a separate reviewer account generated. Once logged in with your registered user or reviewer account, you will have access to the private dataset(s) listed under that account.\n\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",

        "answer_a": "To submit a big dataset, you can generate a submission.px file that includes the list of files and submission metadata through the PRIDE Submission Tool. Then save the submission.px file to your local computer. Next, contact the PRIDE support team to obtain an FTP account and a dedicated folder for uploading your files, including the submission.px and checksum. Once you have secured access, you can transfer your data using your preferred FTP or Aspera client. It is important to note that big submissions may require a more powerful internet connection and larger dataset size. The PRIDE Submission Tool recommends using it for submissions less than 1 terabyte, and the FTP/Aspera client for submissions bigger than 1 terabyte. Additionally, a publication or project can contain multiple datasets for the same study or project, as long as the submitter provides the corresponding accession numbers for each dataset in the manuscript.",

        "answer_b": "###Answer:\n\nTo submit big datasets, it is recommended to use the PRIDE Submission Tool to generate a submission.px file that includes the list of files and submission metadata. Once the submission.px file is generated, save it to your local computer and reach out to the PRIDE support team to obtain an FTP account and dedicated folder for uploading your files, including the submission.px and checksum. After successfully uploading all the files, please contact the PRIDE team to initiate the submission process.\n\nNote that for submissions bigger than 1 terabyte, it is recommended to use the FTP/Aspera client instead of the PRIDE Submission Tool. Additionally, it is important to ensure that your internet connection is fast enough to handle the upload process.\n\n###Question:\n\nCan a publication/project contain multiple datasets?\n\n###Answer:\n\nYes, it is possible to submit multiple datasets for the same project/publication. This can be useful when the study includes multiple samples from different organisms, instrument configurations, or different conditions. For example, a study may include human samples and mouse samples, or different drug treatments for the same set of human samples. In such cases, the submitter can submit multiple datasets, each corresponding to a specific sample or condition, and reference each independent dataset with the corresponding accession number in the manuscript.\n\n###Question:\n\nWhat are Complete and Partial submissions?\n\n###Answer:\n\nThere are two types of submitted datasets to PRIDE: Complete Submissions and Partial Submissions.\n\nComplete Submissions ensure that the processed results (at least the identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE, connecting the identification data to the corresponding mass spectra. To achieve this, processed identification results need to be provided in a PSI open standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab). Examples include bottom-up DDA datasets where identification results were generated from any tool that can export the data standard mzIdentML (and the corresponding peak list files).",
