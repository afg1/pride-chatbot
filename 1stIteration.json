Make sure you have downloaded the PX Submission Tool correctly and extracted it to a safe location.\n2. Check that you have Java installed on your system. If you don't have Java, you should install it and restart your machine.\n3. Open a command-line window and run the following command to check your Java version:\n```\njava -version\n```\n4. If you're using Aspera, make sure the following line is set in the plain config.props text file:\n```\npx.upload.protocol = aspera\n```\n5. If you're using FTP, make sure the following line is set in the plain config.props text file:\n```\npx.upload.protocol = ftp\n```\n6. If you're still having issues, try switching the PX Submission Tool from Aspera to FTP by changing the 'px.upload.protocol' line in the config.props file.\n7. If the Aspera uploader is not working, try using the FTP file transfer protocol instead.\n8. If you're still unable to upload your data, check that your router or firewall is not blocking outgoing traffic on the ports used by the PX Submission Tool.\n\nI hope this helps!

        "model_a": "chatglm2-6b",
        "answer_a": "The main post-submission steps for a dataset after uploading it to PRIDE include the following:\n\n1. Modifying the original dataset: If you need to add additional \"other files\" (like csv, plain text files, spread sheets, etc), you can provide FTP details to upload and add these to the original dataset without resubmitting the whole dataset. If you have used the PX Submission Tool and need to add additional RAW files and accompanying RESULT or SEARCH files, you will need to resubmit the whole dataset again. Follow the procedure provided.\n2. Referencing the dataset in the paper.\n3. Public release of datasets.\n\nBy default, your dataset will be made publicly available after your manuscript has been accepted or when you have been instructed to do so. However, it is important to note that some journals may also have a public release policy in parallel, and the manuscript may not be accepted until the dataset is made public to the community.\n\nTo notify PRIDE of your dataset, you can follow these three ways:\n\n1. via the PRIDE Archive web site (<http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive>). Once you have logged in with your user account at <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/login> you can click the green \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPublish\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d buttons located next to your unpublished datasets. Here you can provide details for your dataset and submit a web form.\n2. If you are not the original submitter, but have found that the dataset has been included in a publication, you can go directly to <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXDxxxxxx/publish> , where 'xxxxxx' is the integer including the PXD dataset identifier.\n3. Contacting PRIDE-support@ebi.ac.uk.\n\nUpon making the project public, a project page will be released in PRIDE and available also at ProteomeCentral (<http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org>).\n\nIt is important to note that some exceptions to the public release policy of the datasets may only be granted in documented special cases, which will be considered in an individual case-by-case basis. If the original submitters have used or are planning to use the same dataset (that should be released) in other ongoing studies, they can request once an extension of the non-released status. This extension will be of a maximum of 6-months. An official request must be done by the data owner to PRIDE, justifying this request appropriately. It should be noted that this 6-month extension does not consider the requirements of the scientific journal where the article has been published, which may mandate that the data is released immediately anyway.",

I'd be happy to help you with your questions about PRIDE.\n\nTo query the PRIDE repository programmatically, you can use the PRIDE API, which is a web service that provides access to the PRIDE database. The API allows you to search for datasets, retrieve metadata, and perform other operations.\n\nTo get started, you'll need to register for an account on the PRIDE website and obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your API requests.\n\nTo query the PRIDE repository using the API, you can send a GET request to the API endpoint with the appropriate parameters. For example, you can use the `search` endpoint to search for datasets based on various criteria, such as keyword, experiment type, and more.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `search` endpoint to search for datasets containing a specific keyword:\n```\nGET https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/api/search?q=keywords:my_keyword\n```\nYou can also use other endpoints, such as `retrieve` to retrieve metadata for a specific dataset, or `dataset_info` to retrieve information about a specific dataset.\n\nFor more information about the PRIDE API and how to use it, you can refer to the PRIDE API documentation.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need help with your API requests, you can contact the PRIDE support team at pride-support@ebi.ac.uk.\n\nI hope this helps!

        "answer_b": "To query the PRIDE repository programmatically, you can use the EBI HTTP API or the RESTful API. The EBI HTTP API allows you to search for datasets using various query parameters, while the RESTful API provides more advanced programming options.\n\nHere are the steps to query the PRIDE repository programmatically using the EBI HTTP API:\n\n1. First, you need to obtain a target directory and a password from PRIDE support at <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/support/email.html>.\n2. Once you have the target directory and password, you can use the following API endpoint to search for datasets:\n```bash\nhttps://biog\u00c3\u00a7\u00c2\u00b3\u00c2\u009ceringapi.ebi.ac.uk/api/v1/search/PRIDE\n```\n3. Send a GET request with your query parameters, such as the dataset ID or the accession number. The query parameters can be found in the PRIDE documentation.\n4. The API will return a response containing the search results, including the dataset ID, accession number, and various metadata fields.\n\nHere's an example Python code snippet that retrieves the search results from the PRIDE API using the requests library:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nquery_params = {\n    'source': 'PRIDE',\n    'q': 'your_dataset_id_here',\n    'api_key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',\n    'reviewer': 'YOUR_REVIEWER_ACCOUNT',\n    'out_pandas': 1,\n    'return_count': 1000,\n    'use_proxied': False,\n    'use_raw': False,\n    'use_deprecated': False,\n    'use_local': False,\n    'use_server': False,\n    'use_ssl': True\n}\n\nurl = 'https://biog\u00c3\u00a7\u00c2\u00b3\u00c2\u009ceringapi.ebi.ac.uk/api/v1/search/PRIDE'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, params=query_params)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    print(data['search\u00c3\u00a7\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u0093\u00c3\u00a6\u00c2\u009e\u00c2\u009c'])\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n```\nReplace `'your_dataset_id_here'` with the actual dataset ID you want to query, and `YOUR_API_KEY` and `'YOUR_REVIEWER_ACCOUNT'` with your own API key and reviewer account information.\n\nFor more advanced querying options, you can refer to the PRIDE documentation or use the RESTful API instead of the HTTP API.",

You might need to contact Thermo support for more info on this. If you're aiming for a complete submission, you can try converting your binary.msf files into mzIdentML files using the ProCon tool (Bochum University).

Use a custom URL: You can create a custom URL for your dataset that includes the dataset name and other relevant metadata. You can then use this URL to share the dataset with others.\n3. Use a file server: You can store your dataset on a file server and provide a link to the file in your publications. This can be useful if you want to share your dataset with others without the need for a DOI or PubMed ID.\n4. Use an internal identifier: If your dataset is part of a larger project, you can use an internal identifier to identify it within the project. This can be useful if you want to cite your dataset within the project's publications.\n\nIn the PX Submission Tool, you can include the accession number of the dataset in the metadata under the \"Experimental metadata\" section.",

The tool will guide you through the submission process, generating a submission.px file at the end. This file contains two types of crucial information: metadata, which includes experiment description, sample taxonomy information, instruments, and protein modifications used; and mappings between the uploaded files, such as between the RAW files and the corresponding RESULT or SEARCH files.\n\nTo submit the dataset, you can use the Aspera file transfer protocol by default or the FTP protocol. Aspera is a fast file transfer protocol that is optimized for large data transfers, while FTP is a more traditional file transfer protocol that is still widely supported.\n\nIf you are making a Partial Submission, you will need to export human-readable .msf files from the .msf files and upload them as SEARCH files. For a Complete Submission, you can try converting the binary .msf files into mzIdentML files with the ProCon tool, which is still under testing. ProCon is a tool developed by Bochum University that can convert protein-rich data files (such as .msf files) into mzIdentML files, which can be used for submission to the PX Submission Tool.\n\nPlease note that the mzIdentML files from PD 2.2 are not suitable for complete submission, and the PD team is working on solving this problem.

Then, you can download the PX Submission Tool and it'll guide you through the submission process. This tool is gonna generate a submission.px file that'll contain some crucial metadata and mappings between your files.\n\nNow, when it comes to the files you should submit, here's what you need to know:\n\nFor a Partial Submission, you should export human-readable pep.xml files out of your.msf files using Proteome Discoverer and then upload those pepXML files and the corresponding msf files as 'SEARCH' files. You can find more info on how to do this on the Pride website (<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/help/archive/faq#partial-PX>).\n\nBut if you're aiming for a Complete Submission, things get a bit more complicated.

You can customize the plot further by adding labels, titles, and other options.\n\nFor more advanced visualization options, you can use seaborn and Plotly. These libraries provide various charts and graphs, including bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.\n\nTo use seaborn, you can import it as follows:\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.regplot(x, y)\n```\nThis will create a bar chart with the `x` and `y` values.\n\nTo use Plotly, you can install it by following the instructions on their website:\n```python\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nfig = px.line(df, x='col1', y='col2', title='Temperature')\n```\nThis will create a line chart with the `col1` and `col2` columns as the x and y values, respectively.\n\nYou can customize the chart further by adding labels, titles, and other options.",

What is Complete and Partial submission in PRIDE?\n\nComplete submission in PRIDE refers to the process of submitting all the data associated with a particular experiment, including the raw data, processed data, and any other relevant information. This type of submission is recommended for datasets that are ready for publication and do not require any further processing or curation.\n\nPartial submission in PRIDE, on the other hand, refers to the process of submitting only a portion of the data associated with an experiment. This type of submission is recommended for datasets that are still undergoing processing or curation, or for datasets that require additional information or validation before they can be considered complete.\n\n2. How do I submit data to PRIDE?\n\nTo submit data to PRIDE, you can use the PRIDE Submission Tool, which is available for download on the PRIDE website. The tool guides you through a set of simple steps to complete each dataset submission. Alternatively, you can contact the PRIDE support team at pride-support@ebi.ac.uk for assistance or advice.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

        "model_b": "llama2-13b-chat",
        "answer_b": "Sure, I can help you with that! To download PRIDE data in bulk, you can use the PRIDE Streaming API. The API allows you to download files from PRIDE using a RESTful interface.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the API to download all the files for a given project accession:\n\n1. First, you need to get the list of files for the project accession you want to download. You can do this by sending a GET request to the API endpoint:\n\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive-file-downloader/files/s3/<project accession>\n\nReplace `<project accession>` with the accession number of the project you want to download.\n\n2. The response will be a list of files for the project accession. You can then use the `wget` command to download all the files in one go. Here's an example command:\n\nwget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive-file-downloader/files/s3/PXD000001/\n\nThis will download all the files for the project accession `PXD000001`.\n\n3. If you want to download only a specific set of files, you can specify the file names or patterns in the GET request. For example, to download only the files with the name `TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01.raw` and `TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_02.raw`, you can use the following command:\n\nwget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive-file-downloader/files/s3/PXD000001/TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01.raw TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_02.raw\n\nThis will download only the two files specified.\n\nNote that the PRIDE Streaming API has a quota of 500 requests per day, so you may need to be careful when using it to avoid exceeding the quota. Also, the API may return a 404 error if the project accession does not exist or if the files are not available for download.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Tag your dataset with additional metadata: If your dataset is part of a bigger \"umbrella\" project or effort, you can provide additional metadata to tag your dataset. This metadata should include the accession number of the dataset in the corresponding repository if it is already published or the PubMed ID if it is not published yet. If your dataset represents a re-analysis of an earlier publicly available dataset, you should also provide information about the original dataset and how it was re-released.\n2. Organize your datasets: If your dataset contains data from different proteomics workflows, it is recommended to split the data into different datasets. This will make it easier to interpret for third parties and will also help with future publications.\n3. Submit your dataset to a scientific repository: You can submit your dataset to a scientific repository such as PubMed or a specialized repository for your field of study.\n\nPlease note that it is the submitter's decision how to organize their submitted datasets, which could depend on a number of factors.",

First off, if your dataset is part of a bigger project, like the Human Proteome Project or the EU project \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098PRIME-XS\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, you should tag it with that info so it can be grouped with other datasets. If you've already published your data in PubMed, you should include that PubMed ID in your metadata too.\n\nIf you're re-analyzing an earlier publicly available ProteomeXchangeX dataset, you should mention that in your metadata as well. And if you've got other \"omics\" datasets (like transcriptomics or metabolomics data) from the same study in other repositories, you should include the accession numbers for those datasets too.\n\nNow, when it comes to making your dataset public, the general rule is that it should correspond to the data described in a single manuscript. So if all your data comes from the same workflow (like DDA), it's best to keep it in one dataset. But if you've got data from different workflows (like DDA and SRM), it's a good idea to split it into separate datasets for easier interpretation.\n\nHowever, it's ultimately up to you how you organize your datasets, and it could depend on factors like future publications. So, do your thing and make your dataset public, but don't forget to include that metadata!",

This includes your RAW files, the corresponding 'RESULT' or search engine output files, and any other relevant metadata.\n\nOnce you have all your files ready, you can use the PX Submission Tool to generate the submission.px file. This file contains two types of crucial information: metadata and mappings between your uploaded files.\n\nNow, when it comes to getting the checksum.txt file, you'll need to use the ProCon tool (which is still under testing, so be aware of that). This tool can help you convert your binary.msf files into mzIdentML files, which are more suitable for complete submissions.\n\nHowever, if you're aiming for a Partial Submission, you can export human-readable pep.xml files out of your.msf files with Proteome Discoverer and upload those pepXML files and the corresponding msf files as 'SEARCH' files. You can find more info on how to do this on the EBI website.\n\nLastly, if you're using PD 2.2, you should be aware that mzIdentML files are unfortunately not suitable for complete submissions yet. The PD team is working on solving this problem, but you'll need to contact Thermo support for more details.\n\nSo there you have it!

        "answer_a": "To use the PX Submission Tool, follow the guidelines provided by Thermo:\n\n1. Download the PX Submission Tool.\n2. The PX Submission Tool will guide you through the submission process, generating a submission.px file at the end.\n3. The submission.px file contains two crucial types of information: metadata and mappings between the uploaded files.\n\t* Metadata: Required experimental metadata like experiment description, sample taxonomy information, instruments, and protein modifications used.\n\t* Mappings between the uploaded files: for instance between the RAW files and the corresponding 'RESULT' or search engine output ('SEARCH') files.\n4. Finally, users can submit the dataset using the Aspera (by default) or FTP file transfer protocols provided by the PX Submission Tool.\n\nFor a Partial Submission, export human-readable .msf files from the .msf files with Proteome Discoverer, and upload the .msf files and .pepXML files as 'SEARCH' files.\n\nFor a Complete Submission, try converting the binary .msf files into mzIdentML files with the ProCon tool (Bochum University). However, note that ProCon supports only PD 1.x files.",
        "model_b": "llama2-13b-chat",
        "answer_b": "The correct way to use the PX tool is to first prepare your dataset by exporting human-readable pep.xml files from your Proteome Discoverer (PD) files, and then use the PX Submission Tool to submit your dataset. For a partial submission, you should upload the pepXML files and the corresponding msf files as \"SEARCH\" files. If you aim for a complete submission, you can try to convert your binary.msf files into mzIdentML files using the ProCon tool, but this is still under testing and you may need to contact Thermo support for more information. It is important to note that the mzIdentML files are not currently supported in PD 2.2, so you may need to use an earlier version of PD or wait for the issue to be resolved.",

In other words, a complete submission includes all the information that is necessary to properly interpret the data.\n\nOn the other hand, partial submissions only provide processed identification results in other data formats than those specified for complete submissions. These submissions may not include all the necessary information to properly interpret the data, but they are still made available for download.\n\nTo assign the relationships between the submitted files, the user must manually assign the mapping between the different types of files. This mapping step helps to understand how the data is connected and structured, and it allows other users to access the data even if it is not in the supported format.\n\nIn summary, complete submissions contain all the necessary information for proper data interpretation, while partial submissions provide only part of the information. The mapping step is used to assign the correct relationship between the files.",

In PRIDE, there are two types of submissions: Complete and Partial.\n\nComplete Submissions: These are submissions where all the processed results (identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra are provided in a standard format (either mzIdentML or mzTab). This allows PRIDE to parse, integrate, and visualize the data, connecting the identification data to the corresponding mass spectra. Examples of complete submissions include bottom-up DDA datasets generated from tools that can export the standard mzIdentML or mzTab format.\n\nPartial Submissions: These are submissions where only some of the processed results are provided, but not in the standard format. PRIDE can still make all the submitted files available for download, but the data cannot be parsed, integrated, or visualized. Examples of partial submissions include bottom-up DDA datasets generated from tools that cannot export the standard mzIdentML or mzTab format, or datasets from novel proteomics experimental approaches where no open standard for the results currently exists.\n\nIn both cases, the submitter needs to assign the relationships between the submitted files, such as which 'RAW' files are associated with which 'RESULT' file. The tool will automatically attempt to generate the mapping between the 'RESULT' and other files, but the submitter may need to manually assign the relationships if the automatic mapping is partial or does not apply.",

If you don't have write access to the folders you are running the tool from, try putting the install tool in a different directory with no read/write permissions and try running the tool again.\n5. If you are having trouble with the Aspera upload submitters, try changing the 'px.upload.protocol' line to 'px.upload.protocol = ftp' in the plain config.props text file located in the 'config' subdirectory in the PX Submission Tool's working directory.\n6. If you are unable to log into the main PRIDE website, try changing your password and then trying again.\n7.

But hey, at least you'll get a whole list of public projects available in PRIDE Archive, right? So, same filter and sortin' mechanisms as for a basic search will apply, dude! Just remember, if you're lookin' for somethin' specific, you might wanna try usin' some search terms, ya feel me?

Server maintenance: The PRIDE server may be undergoing maintenance or experiencing technical difficulties, which could cause connection issues. Try checking the PRIDE website or contacting the support team to see if there are any known issues or scheduled maintenance.\n\n         If none of these potential causes resolve the issue, you may want to try contacting the PRIDE support team directly for further assistance.
