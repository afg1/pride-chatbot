open-hermes	What is the difference between Complete and Partial submission?	12764	Complete and partial submission are terms used in the context of the PRIDE database to differentiate between two types of submissions. \n\n        A Complete submission includes both the raw mass spectrometry data files and the processed data files (like Mascot results or ProteinPilot output). This allows for a more complete analysis and verification of the results. \n\n        A Partial submission only includes the processed data files, without the raw mass spectrometry data. While this can still be useful for analysis and verification, it is less comprehensive than a Complete submission.\n\n        In summary, a Complete submission provides more data and therefore a more complete analysis, while a Partial submission provides only a partial view of the data.

Data processing information: The methods used for data processing, such as peak picking or feature extraction.\n\nThe SDRF format is designed to be flexible and can accommodate a wide range of experimental designs and data processing methods. It is also compatible with other file formats used in proteomics, such as MAGE-TAB and mzTab.\n\nIn summary, the SDRF format is a standardized way to describe the relationship between samples and data files in proteomics experiments, and it contains metadata such as sample information, data file information, and experiment information.
llama2-13b-chat	Can I submit metabolomics data to PRIDE? 	28728	Based on the knowledge provided, PRIDE is a database that archives mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to support reproducible research and enable the reuse of data by other researchers. The database welcomes direct user submissions of protein and peptide identification/quantification data with accompanying mass spectra evidence. There are two types of submitted datasets in PRIDE: complete submissions and partial submissions. Complete submissions ensure that the processed results can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE, while partial submissions provide all the submitted files but do not allow for the integration of the results with the mass spectra.\n\nTo answer your question, PRIDE primarily focuses on proteomics data, and it is not designed to store metabolomics data. However, there are other databases and resources available for depositing and sharing metabolomics data, such as the Metabolomics Workbench, the Human Metabolome Database, and the Metabolomics Data Repository.\n\nIf you have metabolomics data and are looking to share it with the scientific community, you may want to consider submitting it to one of these specialized databases or resources. Alternatively, you could also contact the PRIDE support team to inquire about the possibility of submitting your metabolomics data to PRIDE, as they may be able to provide guidance on how to do so.\n\nFinally, when citing PRIDE resources, it is recommended to use the following reference: Perez-Riverol Y, Bai J, Bandla C, Garcia-Seisdedos D, Hewapathirana S, Kamatchinathan S, Kundu DJ, Prakash A, Frericks-Zipper A, Eisenacher M, Walzer M, Wang S, Brazma A, VizcaÃ­no JA.
