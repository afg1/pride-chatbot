llama2-13b-chat	Can I submit metabolomics data to PRIDE? 	23124	Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the information provided, here's a summary of the knowledge related to PRIDE:\n\nPRIDE's mission is to archive all types of proteomics mass spectrometry data for the purpose of supporting reproducible research, allowing the application of quality control metrics, and enabling the reuse of these data by other researchers. PRIDE welcomes direct user submissions of protein and peptide identification/quantification data with the accompanying mass spectra evidence, and any other related data types. There are two types of submitted datasets to PRIDE: complete submissions and partial submissions. Complete submissions ensure that the processed results (at least the identification data) and the corresponding mass spectra can be parsed, integrated, and visualized by PRIDE, connecting the identification data to the corresponding mass spectra. Partial submissions provide processed identification results in other data formats, but the data cannot be parsed, integrated, or visualized by PRIDE.\n\nWhen citing PRIDE resources, the following statement should be included: "The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository [1] with the dataset identifier PXDxxxxxx."\n\nRegarding metabolomics data, PRIDE does not currently accept direct submissions of metabolomics data. However, there are other databases and resources available for depositing and accessing metabolomics data, such as the Metabolomics Workbench, the Human Metabolome Database, and the Metabolomics Data Repository.\n\nI hope that helps! If you have any further questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to ask.

llama2-13b-chat	What is the relation between MassIVE and PRIDE database	15877	Hello! I'll be happy to help you with your question.\n\nMassIVE and PRIDE are both databases for storing and sharing proteomics data, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different features.\n\nMassIVE is a database that focuses specifically on mass spectrometry data, while PRIDE is a more general-purpose database for proteomics data that includes not only mass spectrometry data but also other types of data such as protein identification and expression data.\n\nIn terms of their relationship, PRIDE actually uses MassIVE as one of its primary data sources. PRIDE receives mass spectrometry data from MassIVE and other sources, and then adds additional information such as protein identifications and expression data to create a more comprehensive database of proteomics data.\n\nSo, in summary, MassIVE is a specialized database for mass spectrometry data, while PRIDE is a more general-purpose database that incorporates data from multiple sources, including MassIVE.\n\nDo you have any other questions about PRIDE or MassIVE?
