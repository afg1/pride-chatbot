Question,Answer
How can I make my private PRIDE dataset public?,"Login to your PRIDE web account go to profile and select your private dataset. On the right-hand corner of the screen, you can see the ‘Publish’ tab. You can provide the details there. Note: The new submitter’s email must be registered with PRIDE. Please fill in either PubmedID or DOI by selecting the correct option from dropdown and submit. If the PubmedID/DOI doesn’t exist in EuroPMC or if it’s a preprint, the request to make it public will fail. In such cases, it’s better to omit those fields when you request to make the dataset public."
What is the difference between Complete and Partial submission?,A partial submission is a PRIDE a dataset whose results can not be exported to a standard file format like mztab or mzIdentML. For complete submissions results are not only in the specific software result file but also in mzIdentML and mzTab which are standards from HUPO-PSI.
"I want to resubmit my dataset, How can I do it? ","If you want to resubmit your dataset to PRIDE, you should do the following steps: First, you should download the PRIDE submission tool and login into PRIDE using your user account details. Then you should click the option resubmission which give you the option to select from your private datasets. After that, you can modified your submission by changing the metadata but also update, delete or add new files to your existing submission. Finally, a new submission.px file is created and transfer to PRIDE database. "
How to upload mzTab file as a Complete submission? ,"mzTab is a HUPO-PSI tab-delimited file format that contains identification and quantification information. For complete submission, you can provide the mzTab generated from the analysis tool (for example, MaxQuant) and submit to PRIDE during the submission. The PRIDE submission tool will perform a short validation of the mztab format including the reference to the spectra files provided. Multiple tools enable to export to mzTab including MaxQuant, quantms or OpenMS."
Can I add pubmed id after I publish the dataset?,Yes you can add a pubmed ID to your published dataset by contacting pride support team. 
How can I change the submitter’s details and contact?,"Login to your PRIDE web account and go to profile and select your private dataset. On the right-hand corner of the screen, you can see the ‘Transfer Ownership’ tab. You can provide the details there. Note: New submitter’s email must be registered with PRIDE."
How to search PRIDE?,"PRIDE datasets can be searched using the PRIDE Archive search box (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive). The PRIDE search box allows users to search using free text and also filter results using different works including organism, organism part or project tags. In addition, results can be sorted by the relevance of the match, the accession or the publication date."
"Are all datasets submitted to PRIDE, private? ","All datasets submitted to PRIDE are private by default. Submitters (both the researcher who performed the submission and the Principal Investigator) can access their own private datasets by using their PRIDE username and password. Additionally, a username and password are provided to facilitate access for journal editors and reviewers during the manuscript review process."
"What is the SDRF, and what metadata it contains?","The Sample and Data Relationship Format (SDRF-Proteomics) is a tab-delimited text format that describes the relationship between samples and data files. It is optional to provide an SDRF during the submission, however if the user wants to that other researchers find and reuse more their deposited data, the SDRF is crucial to understand the experiments. The SDRF contains metadata about the samples including organism, disease, or organism part; in addition it contains information about the data files like instrument used to measure the sample. Finally it contains the relation between the sample and the file including any spcific property that define that relation like labelling technique such as TMT or label-free or fraction number if fractionation is applied."
Can I submit metabolomics data to PRIDE? ,"PRIDE is a proteomics repository, it contains only information about peptides protein identifications and quantitation values. Then, no metabolomics data should be submitted to PRIDE database."
Is the accession for PRIDE unique? ,The dataset accession generated for every dataset in PRIDE is unique and it is assigned by ProteomeXchange.
What is the relation between MassIVE and PRIDE database,MassIVE and PRIDE databases are both partners of ProteomeXchange. Both resources accept submissions of mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments.
"I do not have pubmedid/doi for publication, how to publish my dataset?","You need to log into the dashboard with your PRIDE user account. Then, you can select the private dataset you want to publish, if you don't have a pubmed accession or a doi, you can skip that information and for the publication of the dataset. If you find any problem you can contact PRIDE support team pride-support@ebi.ac.uk"
How long does it usually take for file validation when uploading files?,"The amount of time that it takes to validate a dataset depends on the number of files and their size, to get the final accession the maximum time you should wait before contacting the PRIDE team is 5 days. "
I inadvertently entered the wrong species during the data submission using the PRIDE Submission Tool. How can I change that?,"Currently only title, descriptions are possible to update in the PRIDE dashboard in order to update the species you have to contact pride support team. "
