The latest version of the PX submission tool is 2.4.3.\n\n        \n        Question: How can I upload a big dataset?\n\n        Answer: For big submissions, we suggest generating the submission.px file through the PRIDE Submission Tool. Then, we recommend reaching out to the PRIDE support team to obtain an FTP account and dedicated folder for uploading your files, including the submission.px and checksum. Once you've secured access, you can employ your preferred FTP or Aspera client to transfer your data. Once all the data is successfully uploaded, please contact the PRIDE team to initiate the submission process. Please note that the recommended approach depends on your internet connection and the size of the dataset. For submissions less than 1 terabyte, we recommend using the PRIDE Submission Tool. For submissions bigger than 1 terabyte, we recommend using the FTP/Aspera client.\n\n        Question: Can you provide more information about the submission summary?\n\n        Answer: The submission summary displays the list of files that will be included in your submission, along with their types and sizes. It also shows the experimental metadata, such as the experiment description, sample taxonomy information, and instruments used. Additionally, it displays the mappings between the uploaded files and the corresponding 'RESULT' or search engine output files. Please review the summary carefully and ensure that all the information is correct before accepting the PRIDE dataset policy and submitting your data.\n\n        Question: How do I troubleshoot issues with the PRIDE submission tool on MAC?\n\n        Answer: If you encounter issues with the PRIDE submission",

        "answer_a": "To submit a DIA dataset to PRIDE, you can submit it as a Partial Submission, where you upload RAW data and a SEARCH file. However, if your dataset involves DIA and other types of data, you can submit them separately using different methods. For metadata, you can add files such as Osw files from OpenSWATH output or SWATH assay libraries. It's possible to submit multiple datasets for a single project, and reference each dataset with its corresponding accession number in the manuscript. To submit your dataset, you can download the PRIDE Submission Tool, generate a submission.px file with metadata and file mappings, and then use the Aspera or FTP protocols provided by the tool to submit your data. After submission, your reference will be generated and PRIDE curators will validate your dataset before it is reviewed by reviewers.",

If you have DIA and DDA data, it is recommended to submit them in separate submissions. Additionally, PRIDE encourages submitters to include relevant metadata and downstream analysis files to provide more context for the data.\n\nRegarding the submission of multiple datasets for the same project/publication, it is possible to submit multiple datasets as long as they meet the PRIDE submission criteria. For example, if the study includes multiple samples from different organisms or different conditions, submitters can submit multiple datasets with corresponding accession numbers in the manuscript.\n\nTo submit a dataset to PRIDE, users can download the PRIDE Submission Tool, which guides them through the submission process and generates a submission.px file containing metadata and mappings between uploaded files. Finally, users can submit the dataset using Aspera or FTP file transfer protocols.\n\nAfter submitting the dataset, a curator will perform an initial assessment, including PRIDE Validation pipeline. If the data validation is successful, the submission is performed, and the submitter receives an email with the dataset identifier and reviewer's credentials.

        "answer_b": "Sure! Here is a summary of the knowledge and a concise answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: How to programmatically query PRIDE repository?\n\nAnswer: To query the PRIDE repository programmatically, you can use the PRIDE Database API. The API provides several endpoints for searching and accessing the data in the PRIDE Archive. The base URL for the API is <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/v2>.\n\nYou can use the API to search for datasets by keyword, experiment, or other criteria. You can also retrieve information about specific datasets, such as the experimental design, the instruments used, and the results obtained. Additionally, you can use the API to download the data in a variety of formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML.\n\nTo get started, you will need to register for a PRIDE account and obtain a target directory and password from the PRIDE support team (pride-support@ebi.ac.uk). Once you have this information, you can use the API to query the repository and access the data.\n\nNote that the PRIDE Archive is a large and complex repository, so it may be helpful to consult the official PRIDE Database API documentation for more detailed information on how to use the API effectively.",
