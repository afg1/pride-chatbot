This suspension was then incubated at 4 \\\\u00b0C for 90 min in a rotation wheel, followed by a 30 min centrifugation at 21,000 g at 4 \\\\u00b0C. Soluble whole cell extracts were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until further usage. Dimethyl RNA pulldowns and mass spectrometry analysis. Buffer solutions were prepared with high-quality, RNase-free reagents. Four individual pull-downs were performed for each dimethyl-based RNA pulldown experiment. 20 \\\\u00b5l of a 50% slurry of streptavidin Sepharose high-performance beads (GE Healthcare) were used for each pull-down. Beads were first washed twice with 1 mL of RNA binding buffer (50 mM HEPES-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 (v/v), 10 mM MgCl2). Samples were centrifuged in a table top centrifuge for 3 min at 1,500 xg at 4 \\\\u00b0C after each wash step. Beads were incubated with RNase inhibitor RNasin plus (Promega) in RNA binding buffer (100 \\\\u00b5l buffer with 0.8 units of RNasin/\\\\u00b5l) for 15 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotating wheel to remove and inactivate RNases. Beads were then centrifuged and RNasin-RNase complexes were removed. Yeast tRNA (50 \\\\u00b5g/mL; AM7119; Life Technologies) in RNA binding buffer was added to preblock the beads. After overnight incubation at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel the beads were washed twice with RNA binding buffer followed by incubation with 5 \\\\u00b5g of biotinylated RNA probe in a total volume of 600 \\\\u00b5l RNA binding buffer. Biotinylated probes were allowed to bind to the streptavidin beads for 30 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel. Beads were then washed with 1 ml of RNA wash buffer (50 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 and 10 mM MgCl2) followed by two washes with protein incubation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) NP40, 0.5 mM DTT, and cOmplete\\\\u2122 EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). Beads were subsequently incubated with 1 mg of whole cell extract for 30 min at room temperature followed by 90 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel, in a total volume of 600 \\\\u00b5l protein incubation buffer supplemented with 30 \\\\u00b5g yeast tRNA and 200 Units RNasin. The beads were then washed three times with 1 mL protein incubation buffer followed by two washes with PBS. Next, beads were resuspended in 50 \\\\u00b5l elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2M urea and 10 mM DTT) for 20 min at room temperature in a thermoshaker at 1,500 r.p.m. A final concentration of 55 mM Iodoacetamide was added and beads were incubated in a thermoshaker for 10 min shaking at 1,500 r.p.m in the dark. 250 ng trypsin was added for 2 h at room temperature in a thermoshaker to partially digest the beads. Supernatant was collected after incubation in a separate tube, 50 \\\\u00b5l elution buffer was added to the beads for 5 min at room temperature in a thermoshaker. Eluates were pooled and 100ng of fresh trypsin was added for overnight digestion of the proteins at room temperature. The resulting tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 Stage tips [1] and differentially labeled with dimethyl isotopes CH2O or CD2O [2]. Labeled peptides were mixed to create forward and reverse reactions (Forward reaction: control probe, CH2O (light), N6-methyl-rA probe, CD2O (medium; reverse reaction: N6-methyl-rA probe, CH2O (light), control probe, CD2O (medium)).

Combining proteomics and mRNA transcriptional profiling, over 500 proteins and genes associated with the Brazilian ZIKV infection were found to be differentially expressed. These genes and proteins provide an interactome map, which indicates that ZIKV controls the expression of RNA processing bodies, miRNA biogenesis and splicing factors required for self-replication. It also suggests that impairments in the molecular pathways underpinning cell cycle and neuronal differentiation are caused by ZIKV.

Soluble whole cell extracts were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until further usage. Dimethyl RNA pulldowns and mass spectrometry analysis. Buffer solutions were prepared with high-quality, RNase-free reagents. Four individual pull-downs were performed for each dimethyl-based RNA pulldown experiment. 20 \\\\u00b5l of a 50% slurry of streptavidin Sepharose high-performance beads (GE Healthcare) were used for each pull-down. Beads were first washed twice with 1 mL of RNA binding buffer (50 mM HEPES-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 (v/v), 10 mM MgCl2). Samples were centrifuged in a table top centrifuge for 3 min at 1,500 xg at 4 \\\\u00b0C after each wash step. Beads were incubated with RNase inhibitor RNasin plus (Promega) in RNA binding buffer (100 \\\\u00b5l buffer with 0.8 units of RNasin/\\\\u00b5l) for 15 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotating wheel to remove and inactivate RNases. Beads were then centrifuged and RNasin-RNase complexes were removed. Yeast tRNA (50 \\\\u00b5g/mL; AM7119; Life Technologies) in RNA binding buffer was added to preblock the beads. After overnight incubation at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel the beads were washed twice with RNA binding buffer followed by incubation with 5 \\\\u00b5g of biotinylated RNA probe in a total volume of 600 \\\\u00b5l RNA binding buffer. Biotinylated probes were allowed to bind to the streptavidin beads for 30 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel. Beads were then washed with 1 ml of RNA wash buffer (50 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 and 10 mM MgCl2) followed by two washes with protein incubation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) NP40, 0.5 mM DTT, and cOmplete\\\\u2122 EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). Beads were subsequently incubated with 1 mg of whole cell extract for 30 min at room temperature followed by 90 min at 4 \\\\u00b0C in a rotation wheel, in a total volume of 600 \\\\u00b5l protein incubation buffer supplemented with 30 \\\\u00b5g yeast tRNA and 200 Units RNasin. The beads were then washed three times with 1 mL protein incubation buffer followed by two washes with PBS. Next, beads were resuspended in 50 \\\\u00b5l elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2M urea and 10 mM DTT) for 20 min at room temperature in a thermoshaker at 1,500 r.p.m. A final concentration of 55 mM Iodoacetamide was added and beads were incubated in a thermoshaker for 10 min shaking at 1,500 r.p.m in the dark. 250 ng trypsin was added for 2 h at room temperature in a thermoshaker to partially digest the beads. Supernatant was collected after incubation in a separate tube, 50 \\\\u00b5l elution buffer was added to the beads for 5 min at room temperature in a thermoshaker. Eluates were pooled and 100ng of fresh trypsin was added for overnight digestion of the proteins at room temperature. The resulting tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 Stage tips [1] and differentially labeled with dimethyl isotopes CH2O or CD2O [2]. Labeled peptides were mixed to create forward and reverse reactions (Forward reaction: control probe, CH2O (light), N6-methyl-rA probe, CD2O (medium; reverse reaction: N6-methyl-rA probe, CH2O (light), control probe, CD2O (medium)).
