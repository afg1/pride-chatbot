### Title
BV-2 cells treated with different nanoparticles

### Description
BV-2 cells treated with different nanoparticles,including rHDL,PEG-PLA NPs,QD,PEG-QD and AuNP.The cells were treated with NPs for 4h.

### Sample Protocol
The BV-2 cells were seeded and cultured in a 6-well cell plate for 24 h. Then cells were exposed to DMEM with 1% DiD-rHDL (25 μg/ml), 1% DiD-PEG-PLA (50 μg/ml), QD (30 μg/ml), PQD (30 μg/ml) and AuNP (5 μg/ml) for 4 h, respectively.

### Data Protocol
BV-2 cells treated with different nanoparticles,including rHDL,PEG-PLA NPs,QD and AuNP.The cells were treated with NPs for 4h.
