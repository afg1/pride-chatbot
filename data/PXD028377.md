### Title
Arabidopsis thaliana NusG IP-LCMS

### Description
We performed immunoprecipitation analysis with leaves from 35S::NusG:MYC transgenic lines throung the MYCantibody, and the product was subjected to LC-MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Total proteins were isolated from three-week old leaves from 35S:AtNusG:MYC transgenic lines with the IP buffer (50mM HEPES, pH7.5; 50 mM NaCl; 10 mM EDTA; 0.2% Triton-X100; 10% Glycerol, 1% PVPP; Protease inhibitor; 2mM DTT ), then was immunoprecipitated with the MYC beads overnight. The immunoprecipitation products were washed four times with washing buffer (50mM HEPES, pH7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10 mM EDTA; 0.1% Triton-X100; 10% Glycerol). The products were dissolved in SDT buffer (2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.6) and subject to mass spectrometry assay by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. LTD.

### Data Protocol
The original data for mass spectrometry analysis were RAW files, and Software Mascot2.2 and Proteome Discoverer1.4 were used for searching Arabidopsis proteome database (version, TAIR10_PEP_20101214). Related parameters are described as follows:Enzyme Trypsin Max Missed Cleavages 2 Fixed modifications Carbamidomethyl (C), Variable modifications Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term) Peptide Mass Tolerance Â± 20 ppm Fragment Mass Tolerance 0.1Da Database TAIR10_pep_20101214 Database pattern Decoy Peptide FDR High
