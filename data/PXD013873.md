### Title
Mechanism of pharmacochaperoning in ATP-sensitive potassium channels revealed by cryo-EM

### Description
ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels composed of a pore-forming Kir6.2 potassium channel and a regulatory ABC transporter sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Mutations that impair channel folding or assembly prevent cell surface expression and cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Structurally diverse K-ATP inhibitors have been shown to act as pharmacochaperones to correct mutant channel expression, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we compare cryoEM structures of K-ATP channels bound to pharmacochaperones glibenclamide, repaglinide, and carbamazepine. DSP cross-linking mass spectrometry was used to partially confirm cryoEM structures.

### Sample Protocol
For each crosslinking experiment, 10 micrograms purified K-ATP channels were incubated with the amine-reactive, homobifunctional crosslinker DSP [dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); 12 angstrom arm length], at a final concentration of 1 mM. DSP powder was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO at 100 mM, then immediately added to the purified sample. Thus, the final reaction buffer contained 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% digitonin, 1 mM DSP, 1% DMSO, and 0.05 mg/ml purified protein in a volume of 200 microliters. The crosslinking reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min on ice and was performed in the presence of 1 micromolar GBC. The reactions were quenched with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and crosslinked protein was precipitated with chloroform/methanol. Tryptic peptides for mass spectrometry were generated with ProteaseMax (Promega) detergent, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the omission of reduction and alkylation steps in order to preserve the disulfide bond within DSP. Precipitated protein was resuspended directly in 0.1% ProteaseMax/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate/3.4 M urea for 60 min at 37C. Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.18 microgram/ml and protein was digested for 4 hours at 37C. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to 0.5% to inactivate trypsin and digests were incubated at room temperature for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min to remove insoluble material.   Digested peptides were then analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an electron transfer dissociation (ETD) source that cleaves the disulfide bond in the cross linker. Peptide digests were dried by vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in 20 microliters of 5% formic acid and injected at a flow rate of 5 microliters/min onto an Acclaim PepMap 100-micron x 2 cm NanoViper 5-micron C18 trap (Thermo Scientific) using mobile phase A containing water and 0.1% formic acid.  After 5 min, the trap was switched in-line with a PepMap RSLC C18 2-micron, 75-micron x 25 cm EasySpray column fitted in an EasySpray nano electrospray source (Thermo Scientific) at 40C.  Peptides were eluted with a 90 min gradient of 7.5% to 30% mobile phase B containing acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 microliter/min. Mass spectrometry data were collected using an Orbitrap Fusion instrument to identify DSP crosslinked peptides.  Survey MS scans were acquired at 120,000 resolution and peptides with charge states of +4 to +8 were selected for data-dependent MS2 scans.  These scans were acquired at 30,000 resolution in the Orbitrap mass analyzer following ETD to selectively fragment the disulfide bond in the DSP crosslinker. This was followed by data-dependent MS3 scans on the top 6 most intense ions in the MS2 scans using collision-induced dissociation in the instrument’s ion trap.

### Data Protocol
DSP crosslinked peptides liberated by EDT fragmentation were identified by SEQUEST searches of MS3 scans using Protein Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific).  The searches were performed using a UniProt Swiss-Prot rat database downloaded in May 2014 containing 8078 entries supplemented with the sequences of hamster SUR1.  Searches were configured to use only MS3 scans, MS(n - 1) precursor masses, differential modifications of 15.995 Da on methionines (oxidation), and +87.998 Da on lysines (mass of DSP crosslinker with cleaved disulfide).  Monoisotopic precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances were 10 ppm and 1.0 Da, respectively, and y and b ion fragments were specified in the search.  Lists of identified peptides were then exported and filtered so that only peptides derived from Kir6.1/SUR1 that also contained the expected +87.998 mass shift at lysine residues were considered.  Peptides falling within 8 scan numbers of one another were further investigated to confirm that they were derived from the same precursor ion during a MS2 scan and had summed masses that were consistent with the mass of the original crosslinked peptide detected in the initiating MS1 scan.

### Publication Abstract
ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels composed of a pore-forming Kir6.2 potassium channel and a regulatory ABC transporter sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x3b2;-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Mutations that impair channel folding or assembly prevent cell surface expression and cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Structurally diverse K<sub>ATP</sub> inhibitors are known to act as pharmacochaperones to correct mutant channel expression, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we compare cryoEM structures of a mammalian K<sub>ATP</sub> channel bound to pharmacochaperones glibenclamide, repaglinide, and carbamazepine. We found all three drugs bind within a common pocket in SUR1. Further, we found the N-terminus of Kir6.2 inserted within the central cavity of the SUR1 ABC core, adjacent the drug binding pocket. The findings reveal a common mechanism by which diverse compounds stabilize the Kir6.2 N-terminus within SUR1's ABC core, allowing it to act as a firm 'handle' for the assembly of metastable mutant SUR1-Kir6.2 complexes.
