### Title
Identification of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)-associated proteins

### Description
BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a multidomain deubiquitinase (DUB) with a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain at its N-terminus.  BAP1 mainly localizes in the nucleus and primarily functions as a transcriptional regulator in diverse cellular pathways, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell death and DNA repair. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of BAP1 is regulated remains lacking. To identify protein factors that may be responsible for the nuclear import of BAP1, we used transiently expressed a N-terminally FLAG-tagged BAP1 in HEK293 freestyle (HEK293F) cells as a bait to pull down BAP1-interacting proteins for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.

### Sample Protocol
The plasmid encoding the full-length BAP1 protein with an N-terminal FLAG-tag was transfected into HEK293F cells for protein expression and purification. Recombinant BAP1 and co-eluates were pulled down by using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody affinity gel resions. The protein samples were denatured and reduced in 10 mM dithioerythreitol (DTE) and 8M urea for one hour, followed by the further alkylation in 25 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) for one hour. The reaction was quenched with 25 mM DTE buffer. Sample digestion was accomplished with trypsin at the enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50 in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) for 16-h incubation at 37C, then quenched with 0.1% formic acid (FA).

### Data Protocol
The raw data obtained from LC-MS/MS acquisition was processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4; Thermo Scientific), searching file using Mascot search engine (v.2.7.0; Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) against the Swissport database [species: Human sapiens]. Search criteria used were trypsin digestion, allowing up to two missed cleavages, mass accuracy of 10 ppm for the parent ion and 0.6 Da for the fragment ions. Variable modifications were set as carbamidomethyl (Cysteine) and oxidation (Methionine). A decoy database search was performed. Identified peptides were filtered with 1% FDR.
