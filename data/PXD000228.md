### Title
Stimulated Human Platelet Lysate: control, PAR1 and PAR4 stimulated

### Description
LC-MS/MS analysis of Control, PAR1-stimulated and PAR4-stimulated platelet lysate digests.  Control lysate digest peptides were labeled with "light", PAR1 lysate digest peptides were labeled with  "intermediate" and PAR4 lysate digest peptides were labeled with "high" dimethyl labeled. Labeled digests  were mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio, separated by SCX and the resulting (phosphopeptide-enriched) peptide fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
