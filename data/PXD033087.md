### Title
Aspergillus fumigatus LC-MS/MS of wild type and delta elp3 mutant

### Description
Proteomic profiles of Aspergillus fumigatus wild type and delta elp3 mutant

### Sample Protocol
lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% Triton-100, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Calbiochem)) was used to extract the total protein. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) to be peptides and then processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT kit. The labeled tryptic peptides were fractionated by HPLC using a Thermo Betasil C18 column (5 μM particles, 10 mm diameter, 250 mm length). After fractioning, the tryptic peptides were analyzed with LC-MS/MS system.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS data processing was performed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against Aspergillus UniProt database concatenated with reverse decoy database.
