### Title
Proteomic analysis of substantia nigra

### Description
Proteomic analysis of human substantia nigra using protein and peptide fractionations strategies coupled to nanoLC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation for proteomic analysis. SN specimens were obtained from frozen brain sections using sterile biopsy punches (size: 3-4 mm) and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mM DTT. The homogenates were spinned down at 100.000 x g for 1 h at 15ºC. Protein concentration was measured in the supernatants with the Bradford assay kit (Biorad). Prior to proteomic analysis, the individual NBM and SN samples were grouped into 2 independent pools containing ~ 300 μg of protein from 3 individual samples each one.  Peptide fractionation by HPLC. Protein material was precipitated using methanol/chloroform. Pellets (~ 700 μg/pool) were dissolved in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and 6M urea. Reduction was performed by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10mM and incubation at 25ºC for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation by 30mM iodoacetamide was performed for 1h in the dark. An additional reduction step was performed by 30 mM DTT, allowing the reaction to stand at 25ºC for 1h. The mixtures were then diluted to 0.6M urea using MilliQ-water, and after trypsin addition (Promega) (enzyme:protein, 1:50 w/w), the sample was incubated at 37ºC for 18 h. Digestion was quenched by acidiﬁcation with acetic acid. The digestion mixture (~ 350μg protein) was dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted with 40ul of 5mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) pH 9.8, and injected to an Ettan LC system with a high pH stable X-Terra RP18 column (C18; 2.1 mm x 150mm; 3.5μm) (Waters) at  a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Peptides were eluted with a mobile phase B of 5–65% linear gradient over 35 min (A, 5 mM ABC in water at pH 9.8; B, 5 mM ABC in acetonitrile at pH 9.8). 16-18 fractions were collected, evaporated under vacuum and reconstituted into 15 μl of 2% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid, 96% water. Protein fractionation by isoelectric focusing (IEF). Approximately 200 μg of each pooled sample was precipitated with methanol/chloroform. The pellet were re-suspended in 300 μl of IEF rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, 0.5% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte) and loaded on 17 cm pH 3–10 IPG strip in a focusing tray. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a Bio-Rad PROTEAN IEF system (Bio-Rad). Conditions for performing IEF were as follows: after rehydration of the IPG strip for 12 h at 50 V and 20°C, the run was started at 250 V for 15 min. followed by rapid voltage ramping to 8000 V without exceeding 50 A/strip. The IEF run was finished when the voltage reached 35,000 Vhr. The voltage was held at 500 V until the run was stopped. The IEF run was performed at 20 °C. Each entire IPG strip was divided into 25 equal parts (~ 0.7 cm each) for in-gel reduction, alkylation, and digestion. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed with 20 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 12 h at 37ºC. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, 85% acetonitrile. Peptide mixtures were completely dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 20 μl 96 % MilliQ-H2O, 2 % acetonitrile, and 2 % formic acid.

### Data Protocol
nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. For each fraction, a total volume of 5μl of tryptic peptides was injected with a flow rate of 300 nL/min in a nanoLC Ultra1D plus (Eksigent). The column and the autosampler were maintained at a temperature of 40°C and 4°C respectively. The mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid (buffer B). A trap column Acclaim PepMap100 (100µm x 2cm; C18, 5 µm, 100Å) and an analytical column Acclaim PepMap RSLC (75 µm x 15 cm, C18, 2 µm, 100 Å) (Dionex) were used following the next gradient: 5% B to 45% B in 120 min and 45%B to 60% B in 10 min. Column was equilibrated in 90% B for 10 min and 5% B for 10 min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using an AB Sciex 5600 TripleTOF™ system. Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 250 ms. Top 20 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set to 100 ms giving a total cycle time of 2300 ms. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 230 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation during 15 s. MS/MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.5.2 (AB Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through Protein Pilot TM Software (v.4.0.8085-ABSciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) for database search against the concatenated target-decoy UniProt human database (Database: uniprot_sprot_20140122). False discovery rate was performed using a non lineal fitting method and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global false discovery rate or better.
