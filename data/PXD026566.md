### Title
Brain proteome analysis of APPswe mouse model at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology

### Description
Plaques consisting of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) in the brain are characteristic for patients with AlzheimerÂ´s disease. AÎ² is enzymatically generated of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). During the disease, AÎ² starts to aggregate forming soluble oligomers, soluble protofibrils and eventually insoluble fibrils. AÎ² pathology starts mainly at the hippocampus and the surrounding cortical area. Mice overexpressing the Aï�¢-precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (APPswe) are one of the most commonly used animal models in Alzheimerâ€™s field. These mice overexpress APP with the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL), which is adjacent to the Î²-secretase cleavage site on APP. This results in increased production of AÎ². The aim of this study was to study the proteome of APPswe brain at the early stages (7-8 months old) of the disease, before plaque onset, which starts at around 11-12 months of age in this mouse model. Homogenates of the hippocampus and the rest of the cerebrum from 7-8 months-old APPswe and wild-type (WT) controls were lysed. Afterwards, filter aided tryptic digestion was performed. The resulting peptides were analyzed using LC-UDMSE. The data was searched against a randomized mouse database and label-free quantification analysis was done. In total 2487 proteins were found. In the hippocampus of APPswe mice, the levels of 1283 proteins were significantly altered compared to WT controls. While 1379 proteins were significantly altered in the rest of the cerebrum of APPswe mice compared to WT controls. Among these, mitochondrial proteins and proteins involved in neuron's development were significantly downregulated, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of neuronâ€™s growth in the brain of APPswe mice at already this stage of the disease.

### Sample Protocol
Seven-eight months old APPswe transgenic mice with the Swedish mutation (APP KM670/671NL) and wild-type controls were perfused with physiological saline. Brains were isolated and the hippocampal area and rest of the cerebrum were separately homogenized and lysed by using tip sonication. 20 Âµg of total protein of each sample were used for filter aided sample preparation including reduction with dithiothreitol, alkylation with iodoacetamid and tryptic digestion (enzyme-to-protein ratio 1:50 (w/w)) for 16 h at 37 Â°C. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 1 %. The samples were dried down at 45 Â°C and reconstituted in 3 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water to a final concentration of 150 ng protein/ÂµL. The resulting peptides were analyzed on a nanoAcquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2-S HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). 300 ng protein/ÂµL were injected in trapping mode on a C18, 5 Âµm, 180 Âµm x 20 mm trap column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The analytical column was a HSS-T3 C18 1.8 Âµm, 75 Âµm x 250 mm column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The oven temperature was set to 40 Â°C. Mobile phase A contained 0.1 % formic acid and 3 % dimethyl sulfoxide in water and mobile phase B 0.1 % formic acid and 3 % dimethyl sulfoxide in acetonitrile. At a flow rate of 0.3 ÂµL/min a gradient was run from 3 % mobile phase B to 40 % (v/v). Positive resolution mode and UDMSE  were used. Through the reference channel of the instrument a lock mass solution consisting of 0.1 µM [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B and leu-enkephalin (1 µM) was introduced every 60 s.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS raw data was processed using ProteinLynx Global Server 3.0.3 and searched against a randomized UniProt mouse database. The following parameter were used: false discovery rate of 0.01, trypsin as digest reagent, carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed modification, acetyl lysine, C-terminal amidation, asparagine deamidation, glutamine deamidation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications, one missed cleavage per peptide, one minimum fragment ion matches per peptide, three minimum fragment ion matches per protein and two minimum peptide matches per protein. ISOQuant 1.8 was used for label-free quantification analysis.

### Publication Abstract
Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological aggregation of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) peptide. A potential therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is to enhance A&#x3b2; degradation by increasing the activity of A&#x3b2;-degrading enzymes, including neprilysin. The somatostatin (SST) peptide has been identified as an activator of neprilysin. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of a brain-penetrating SST peptide (SST-scFv8D3) to increase neprilysin activity and membrane-bound A&#x3b2;42 degradation in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing the A&#x3b2;-precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (APPswe). Using LC-MS, we further evaluated the anti-Alzheimer's disease effects of SST-scFv8D3. Following a triple intravenous injection of SST-scFv8D3, the LC-MS analysis of the brain proteome revealed that the majority of downregulated proteins consisted of mitochondrial proteins regulating fatty acid oxidation, which are otherwise upregulated in APPswe mice compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment with SST-scFv8D3 significantly increased hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins regulating cell membrane trafficking and neuronal development. Finally, hippocampal concentrations of growth-regulated &#x3b1; (KC/GRO) chemokine and degradation of neuropeptide-Y were elevated after SST-scFv8D3 treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate a multifaceted effect profile in regulating mitochondrial function and neurogenesis following treatment with SST-scFv8D3, further suggesting the development of Alzheimer's disease therapies based on SST peptides.
