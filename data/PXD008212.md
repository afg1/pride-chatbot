### Title
Picky – a simple online method designer for targeted proteomics

### Description
The accuracy of the retention time prediction build into picky was tested on a digested HeLa sample analyzed with a standard data-dependend acquisition method (top20).

### Sample Protocol
Ready to use HeLa (1µg) protein digest standard (Pierce) or tryptic E.coli peptides (500 ng) were used for the injection.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed with MaxQuant 1.5.8.0. with the following settings: (multiplicity=0;Enzyme=Trypsin, including cut after proline; Oxidation (M) and N-terminal Acetylation set as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modification; Second Peptide Search disabled; database: Uniprot Human Proteome 2012 for HeLa samples or protein database for Ecoli_K12-MG1655 as obtained from http://cmr.tigr.org in 2008 for E.coli samples; Peptide and Protein FDR set to 0.01).
