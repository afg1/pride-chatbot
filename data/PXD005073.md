### Title
Kinase activity ranking (KAR) quantifies the contribution of protein kinases to the regulation of cell viability

### Description
New method to determine kinase activity based on phosphoproteomics data

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed in 8M drea buffer, urea concentration was reduced to 2M with 20 mM Hepes pH8.0 and proteins were digested with trypsin. Peptide solutions were desalted using oasis cartridges and phosphopeptides enriched using TiO2

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using Mascot and quantified using Pescal, a in house developed software for label free quantification that uses extracted ion chromatograms (XICs)

### Publication Abstract
Cell survival is regulated by a signaling network driven by the activity of protein kinases; however, determining the contribution that each kinase in the network makes to such regulation remains challenging. Here, we report a computational approach that uses mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data to rank protein kinases based on their contribution to cell regulation. We found that the scores returned by this algorithm, which we have termed kinase activity ranking using phosphoproteomics data (KARP), were a quantitative measure of the contribution that individual kinases make to the signaling output. Application of KARP to the analysis of eight hematological cell lines revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1/2, casein kinase (CK) 2, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and p21-activated kinase (PAK) were the most frequently highly ranked kinases in these cell models. The patterns of kinase activation were cell-line specific yet showed a significant association with cell viability as a function of kinase inhibitor treatment. Thus, our study exemplifies KARP as an untargeted approach to empirically and systematically identify regulatory kinases within signaling networks.
