### Title
PRM analysis of C-glycosylation substrate

### Description
To assess the impact of mutations on CMT activity C-glycosylation within RNase E was monitored using PRM analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Affinity enriched RNase E were cleaned up using S-trap columns, digested with gluC and then C18 clean up. Digests were then run on an Exploris 480.

### Data Protocol
To quantify the relative level of C-glycosylation within samples extracted ion chromatograms of the monoisotopic peaks of the +2 charge states were extracted, Â±10 ppm, using the Freestyle Viewer (1.7 SP1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peaks were processed with a 15-point Gaussian smooth and the area under the curve calculated. The resulting areas were used to compare peptide species with occupation rates provided as a percentage of the total ion current of compared species.
