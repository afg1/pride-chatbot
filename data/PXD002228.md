### Title
Mammalian Bcnt/Cfdp1, a potential epigenetic factor characterized by an acidic stretch in the disordered N-terminal and S250 phosphorylation in the conserved C-terminal regions

### Description
The function of mammalian Bcnt protein is poorly understood yet, though Bcnt homologs (yeast Swc5 and Dorsophila Yeti) play crucial roles in chromatin remodeling organization. In this study, we found that mammalian Bcnt protein shows unusual mobility on SDS-PAGE and is acetylated in vitro by CREB-binding protein. Therefore,  we analyzed Bcnt protein by LC-MSMS to characterize the protein structure containing post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and acetylation) which may be the cause of this unusual mobility.

### Sample Protocol
SDS-PAGE separated bands were destained and digested with trypsin (TPCK-treated, Worthington Biochemical) or endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Diagnostics). The digests were analyzed several times by nano liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw files were combined and converted to mgf files using Proteome Discoverer (v. 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The database search was performed against an in-house database using the MASCOT program (version 2.3; Matrix Sciences) under these parameters: 3 or 4 missed cleavages, precursor ion tolerance = +/- 15 or 20 ppm, fragment ion tolerance = +/- 15 or 20 mmu, variable modifications: Deamidated (NQ), Gln → pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Oxidation (M), Phospho (ST), Acetyl (K), Propionamide (C). Quantitative analysis based on peak area of MS chromatogram using Qual Browser (version2.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed. The description about each analysis data is as follows.
