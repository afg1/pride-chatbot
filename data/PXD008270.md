### Title
Tyrosine-1 of RNA polymerase II CTD controls global termination of gene transcription in mammals

### Description
The aim of the project was to analyse the functional role of Tyrosine-1 of mammalian RNA polymerase II CTD in the regulation of transcription-coupled processes.  We studied mammalian CTD mutants to analyze the function of tyrosine1 residues. Mutation of 3/4 of the tyrosine residues in a mutant YFFF resulted in a massive read-through transcription phenotype. Read-through was observed for 3’ processed and polyadenylated RNAs. The YFFF mutant shows a loss of interaction with the Mediator and Integrator complexes in MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Recombinant Pol II was purified using α-HA antibody (12CA5) was coupled to sepharose A/G beads. Following the IP, samples were subjected to either On-beads trypsin digest or In-gel trypsin digest. For LC-MS/MS purposes, desalted peptides were injected in an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo), separated in a 15-cm analytical column (75μm ID with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 2.4 μm from Dr. Maisch) with a 50 min gradient from 5 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.

### Data Protocol
The volcano plot for the MS-MS analysis was generated using software R.

### Publication Abstract
The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase (Pol) II is composed of a repetition of YSPTSPS heptads and functions as a loading platform for protein complexes that regulate transcription, splicing, and maturation of RNAs. Here, we studied mammalian CTD mutants to analyze the function of tyrosine1 residues in the transcription cycle. Mutation of 3/4 of the tyrosine residues (YFFF mutant) resulted in a massive read-through transcription phenotype in the antisense direction of promoters as well as in the 3' direction several hundred kilobases downstream of genes. The YFFF mutant shows reduced Pol II at promoter-proximal pause sites, a loss of interaction with the Mediator and Integrator complexes, and impaired recruitment of these complexes to chromatin. Consistent with these observations, Pol II loading at enhancers and maturation of snRNAs are altered in the YFFF context genome-wide. We conclude that tyrosine1 residues of the CTD control termination of transcription by Pol II.
