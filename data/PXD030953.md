### Title
Spatiotemporal expression of regulatory kinases directs the transition from  mitosis to cellular morphogenesis in Drosophila

### Description
Embryogenesis depends on a tightly regulated balance between mitosis, differentiation, and morphogenesis.  Understanding how the embryo uses a relatively small number of proteins to transition between growth and morphogenesis is a central question of developmental biology, but the mechanisms controlling mitosis and differentiation are considered to be fundamentally distinct. Here we show the mitotic kinase Polo, which regulates all steps of mitosis in Drosophila, also directs cellular morphogenesis after cell cycle exit.

### Sample Protocol
If you download and install the Scaffold 4 software, double-clicking on the datafile, will open ScaffoldViewer allowing you to review the data. Your samples will appear as columns with the sample name at the top of the column. The last two digits of the sample name is the sample number. Rows represent proteins identified within these samples.

### Data Protocol
Bsd was purified in bacteria, AP was peformed with Drosophila embryo lysate.
