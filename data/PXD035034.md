### Title
Cardiac Hypertensive-Cmpd17b (therapeutic)

### Description
Formyl peptide receptors (FPR) play a critical role in the regulation of resolution of inflammation, an important mediator of hypertension-induced cardiac damage. We have previously discovered an FPR small-molecule prototype Cmpd17b exhibit cardioprotective effects against acute and severe cardiac inflammatory insults, but its impact on chronic cardiac inflammatory insult, such as hypertension, has not been explored. To investigate the therapeutic potential of our FPR agonist on mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac remodelling and function in hypertensive mice.

### Sample Protocol
Frozen left ventricle homogenized in urea, extracted and tip-probe sonication and lysates quantified by microBCA, and Sera‐Mag-based workflow using 10mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20mM iodoacetamide and digestion with LysC and trypsin at a 1:100/50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio for 16h at 37°C.

### Data Protocol
Peptide identification and quantification were performed as described using MaxQuant (v1.6.6.0) with its built-in search engine Andromeda6. Tandem mass spectra were searched against Mus musculus (mouse) reference proteome (UP000000589; proteome 55,398) supplemented with common contaminants and generated spectral library. Search parameters were as follows: carbamidomethylated cysteine as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modifications, trypsin/P/LysC as proteolytic enzyme with  2 missed cleavage sites, search tolerance 7 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance 0.5 Da, <1% false discovery rate on peptide spectrum match with target-decoy approach at peptide and protein levels, match between runs (MBR) selected, and label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm employed.
