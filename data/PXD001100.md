### Title
Human Sumoylome (SUMO-2) upon bacterial infection

### Description
Given the role of SUMOylation in pathogenic infection, we wanted to evaluate the changes to the host SUMO-2 subproteome during Shigella infection. HeLa cells  overexpressing TAP-SUMO-2 or TAP-empty  were used in conjunction with SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture) (Golebiowski et al, 2009, 2010). Cells  were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium except that L-arginine and L-lysine were replaced with stable isotope (SILAC) forms depending on the treatment. Medium was supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. SILAC experiment compared TAP-containing cells (Lys0 and Arg0) with invasive Shigella flexneri (M90T) infected TAP-SUMO-2-containing cells (4,4,5,5-D4-lysine, Lys4, and 13C6- arginine, Arg6) and TAP-SUMO-2-containing cells infected with (mxiD) non-invasive strain of Shigella (13C6 15N2-lysine, Lys8, and 13C6 15N4 -arginine, Arg10).

### Sample Protocol
Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% SDS, 10mM iodoacetamide, 1mM EDTA, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and stored at -80°C. Prior purification, lysates were thawed out, sonicated and protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Protein samples were mixed in 1:1:1 ratio. The pooled lysate, containing around 400mg of proteins was centrifuged at 180,000g for one hour at 20°C. A small aliquot was kept for crude samples analysis, while the remaining majority of the lysate was refolded by diluting 25 times in renaturation buffer (50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.75 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2mM iodoacetamide, and 0.5 mM EDTA). TAP-SUMO-2 proteins were purified as described previously (Golebiowski et al, 2009, 2010). Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed by nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Parameters of data acquisition and data analysis are previously described (Tatham et al, 2011).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed with MaxQuant software (version1.3.0.5) and Andromeda search engine was used for peptide identifications (Cox et al, 2011, 2009).To account for imperfect sample mixing and incomplete label incorporation, raw M/L, H/L and H/M ratios were normalized. Data were normalized using ratio values derived from the internal contaminants in the experiment as described previously (Golebiowski et al,  2009). Proteins that had a Log2 M/L>-0.5 or Log2 H/L>-0.5 were considered as external contaminants  and proteins with a Log2M/L or H/L between - 1.2 and 1.2 were considered as internal contaminants of the purification.

### Publication Abstract
Shigella flexneri, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery, invades the human colonic epithelium and causes its massive inflammatory destruction. Little is known about the post-translational modifications implicated in regulating the host defense pathway against Shigella. Here, we show that SUMO-2 impairs Shigella invasion of epithelial cells in vitro. Using mice haploinsufficient for the SUMO E2 enzyme, we found that sumoylation regulates intestinal permeability and is required to restrict epithelial invasion and control mucosal inflammation. Quantitative proteomics reveals that Shigella infection alters the sumoylation status of a restricted set of transcriptional regulators involved in intestinal functions and inflammation. Consistent with this, sumoylation restricts the pro-inflammatory transcriptional response of Shigella-infected guts. Altogether, our results show that the SUMO pathway is an essential component of host innate protection, as it reduces the efficiency of two key steps of shigellosis: invasion and inflammatory destruction of the intestinal epithelium.
