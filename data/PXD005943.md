### Title
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRBPome in oxidative stress conditions

### Description
This project aims to identify novel RNA binding proteins in the baker's yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae, involved in the oxidative stress,. Since interactions between RNAs and proteins may be transient, yeast cells, either untreated and growth in rich media and exposed to 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes were crosslinked with UV light at 254 nm which promotes the covalent link between proteins and RNAs. After this, polyadenylated mRNAs were purified via oligo(dT) coupled to magentic beads under stringent conditions. Finally, samples were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. To rule out the possibility of RNA-independent binding we also analysed other samples where we performed competition assays with polyadenylic acid

### Sample Protocol
The yeast strain BY4741 was grown in 500 ml YPD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% D-glucose) at 30 °C with constant shaking at 220 r.p.m. In parallel yeast strain BY4741 was grown in 500 ml YPD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% D-glucose), and 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide was added to the culture once it reached the mid log phase and incubated for 15 minutes. Cells were collected at mid-log phase (OD600 ~ 0.6) by centrifugation and washed three times with phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS). For UV crosslinking, the cells were resuspended in 25 ml of PBS and exposed to 1,200 mJ/cm2 of 254 nm UV in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) with two 2-min breaks on ice and gentle mixing. Cells were resuspended in 4 ml lysis buffer [100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, 20 U ml-1 DNase I (Promega), 100 U ml-1 RNasin (Promega), complete EDTA-free protease-inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] and lysed with glass beads in a tissue lyser (TissueLyser RETSCH MM200, Qiagen) at 4 °C. The cooled lysate was cleared by three sequential centrifugations at 4 °C at 3,000 g for 3 min, and 5,000 g and 10,000 g for 5 min each. A negative controls were introduced at this stage: the extract was incubated with 20 mg of poly(A) (Sigma, Cat. No. P9403) for competition experiments. To capture polyadenylated RNAs for mRBPome analysis, one milligram of oligo[dT]25 Dynabeads (Life Technologies, Cat. No. 61011) was equilibrated in lysis buffer, mixed with the extracts (~5 mg) and incubated on a shaker for 10 min at room temperature (RT). The beads were collected with a magnet and the supernatant recovered for later repeat incubations. The beads were then washed once with 500 ul of wash buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mM LiCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) and twice with 500 ul wash buffer B (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 600 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA). The poly(A) RNA was eluted from beads in 60 ul of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 80 °C for 2 min and collected. The entire procedure was repeated twice by reapplying the supernatant extract to the oligo[dT]25 beads, which were recovered after elution and washed three times with lysis buffer prior reapplication. The three sequential eluates were combined and concentrated to 70 ul in a 0.5 ml Microcon-10 kD Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore, MRCPRT010). In total, we subjected 12 samples for MS analysis: three biological replicates of the mRBPome in untreated cells, 3 replicates of cells exposed to 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide, and three replicates of the corresponding poly(A) competition experiments. 50 μl of the samples (~ 8-10 μg of protein) were run on a 4–12% NuPAGE Novex acrylamide gel (Life Sciences). The gel lane was cut into one slice and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion using a ProGest automated digestion unit (Digilab UK). The resulting peptides were fractionated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system in line with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, peptides in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Dionex). After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Dionex) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-6% solvent B over 1min., 6-15% B over 58 min, 15-32% B over 58min, 32-40% B over 3 min, 40-90% B over 1 min, held at 90% B for 6 min and then reduced to 1% B over 1 min) with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were ionized by nano-electrospray ionization at 2.1 kV using a stainless steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 μm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 °C. Tandem mass spectra were acquired using an LTQ- Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The Orbitrap was set to analyse the survey scans at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400) in the mass range m/z 300 to 2,000 and the top twenty multiply charged ions in each duty cycle selected for MS/MS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Charge state filtering, where unassigned precursor ions were not selected for fragmentation and dynamic exclusion (repeat count, 1; repeat duration, 30s; exclusion list size, 500) was used. Fragmentation conditions in the LTQ were as follows: normalized collision energy, 40%; activation q, 0.25; activation time 10 ms; and minimum ion selection intensity, 500 counts.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer software v1.2 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the SwissProt SPECIES database using the Mascot algorithm (Version 2.4). Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.8 Da. Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) as a variable modification. Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of one missed cleavage was allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all peptide data was filtered to satisfy the false discovery rates (FDR) of 1%. To define a list of proteins referred to as the yeast mRBPome either in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide, we initially considered the 1,590 proteins that were enriched in at least one of the three biological replicates  either of untreated or stressed cells with a FDR of at least 1% at the protein identification and quantification level. Of these, we selected 1,070 proteins that were identified with at least 2 peptides, and for which data was obtained in two out of three biological replicates (either untreated or stressed cells), leaving 817 proteins. Of those 600 proteins were present in two out of three biological replicates in both unstressed and stressed cells whereas 68 proteins were only present in two out of three untreated biological replicates, and 145 proteins present in two out of three stressed cells.

### Publication Abstract
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that play a substantial role during stress adaptation. Recent proteome-wide surveys have uncovered a large number of new and "unconventional" RBPs such as metabolic enzymes, yet little is known about the reconfiguration of the RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) and RNA-enzyme interactions in response to cellular stress. Here, we applied RNA-interactome capture to monitor the dynamics of the mRBPome upon mild oxidative stress in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Among the 257 proteins that significantly changed RNA associations, we observed the coordinated remodeling of RNA-binding enzymes - particularly of the central carbon metabolism - that complemented known metabolic responses. Furthermore, we recognized the propensity for paralogous specific alterations of enzyme-RNA interactions. Our results suggest coordinated cross talk between RNA-enzyme interactions and intermediary metabolism to maintain the physiological and molecular balance upon oxidative stress, perhaps through specialization of paralogous during evolution.
