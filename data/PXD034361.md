### Title
Concomitant targeting of viral and host methyltransferases is essential for attenuating SARS-CoV-2

### Description
LC-MS/MS based investigation of protein abundance changes, induced by DZNep treatment in A549-ACE2 cell line (0.75 uM DZNep, vehicle PBS; 6h pre-treatment, harvested 24 h.p.i. with mock/SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 3) or primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) (1.5 uM DZNep, vehicle PBS; 6h pre-treatment, harvested 36 h.p.i. with mock/SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 3), or by Tubercidin in A549-ACE2 cell line (1 uM Tubercidin, vehicle DMSO; 3h pre-treatment, harvested 24 h.p.i. with mock/SARS-CoV at MOI 0.01/SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1).

### Sample Protocol
See method section of the parental manuscript or Stukalov et al., Multilevel proteomics reveals host perturbations by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, Nature, 2021.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed with MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 (version 1.6.17 for DZNep treatment of A549-ACE2 cell line).
