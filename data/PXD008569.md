### Title
Hippocampal synaptoneurosomes-2

### Description
Hippocampal synaptoneurosomes from WT and Ts1Cje mice treated or not with rapamycin were analyzed by 8-plex iTRAQ. Technical replicates were included.

### Sample Protocol
Synaptoneurosomal proteins were extracted using a lysis buffer that contained SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma), and benzoase. After incubation for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged for 15 min (14,000 rpm in a bench-top microfuge at 4ºC) and proteins present in the supernatant were quantified. iTRAQ labeling (AB ScieX) was essentially performed following the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting the protein precipitation step in order to conserve minority proteins. 50 micrograms of proteins were labeled.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo), setting the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of both proteins and peptides identification to be less than 0.01.
