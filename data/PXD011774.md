### Title
An Mtw1 C-terminal motif is crucial for cooperative outer kinetochore assembly in budding yeast

### Description
We employed chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry on KMN complexes isolated from S. cerevisiae.

### Sample Protocol
Native kinetochore complexes were tagged, purified using a tandem purification protocol and cross linked with BS3. After quenching samples were digested and peptides were enriched using a size exclusion column.

### Data Protocol
Cross links were identified by xQuest software. The results were filtered according to the following parameters: delta score </= 0.85, MS1 tolerance window -4 to 4 ppm and score </= 22. The quality of filtered cross links was manually validated and the network was visualized using the webserver xVis.
