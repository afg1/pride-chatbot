### Title
Protein synthesis during myoblast differentiation

### Description
Mole (MSR) and fractional (FSR) synthesis rates of proteins during C2C12 myoblast differentiation were investigated. Myoblast cultures supplemented with D2O during 0-24 h or 72-96 h of differentiation were analysed by LC-MS/MS to calculate protein FSR and MSR after samples were spiked with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1).

### Sample Protocol
Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS, prior to incubation on ice in 250 μl/well RIPA buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5 % deoxycholic acid, 10 % NP-40, 10 mM EDTA) for 5 min. Cells were then harvested using a cell scraper and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of harvested samples was measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA™) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) against bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards (0-2 mg/ml) prepared in RIPA buffer. Proteins were digested consistent with our recent work [13-15]. Briefly, lysates containing 100 g protein were digested with trypsin using the filter aided sample preparation (FASP) method. Aliquots, containing 4 µg peptides, were desalted using C18 Zip-tips (Millipore, Billercia, MA, USA) and resuspended in 0.1 % formic acid spiked with 10 fmol/ul yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) (Waters Corp. Milford, MA) in preparation for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Peptide mixtures were analysed by nanoscale reverse-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC; NanoAcquity; Waters Corp.) and online electrospray ionization quadrupole–time-of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF Premier; Waters Corp.), as previously reported [13-15]. For all measurements, the mass spectrometer was operated in positive electrospray ionization mode at a resolution of >10,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM). Peptide mass spectra were recorded between 350 and 1600 m/z using survey scans of 0.9 s duration with an interscan delay of 0.1 s. In addition, data-dependent MS/MS spectra were collected from control samples over the range 50–2000 m/z for the 5 most abundant precursor ions of charge 2+ or 3+.

### Data Protocol
Label-free quantitation was performed using Progenesis Quantitative Informatics for proteomics (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) consistent with our previous work [13, 14, 19]. MS/MS spectra were exported in Mascot generic format and searched against the Swiss-Prot database restricted to ‘mus musculus’ (17,006 sequences) using a locally implemented Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) server (version 2.2.03). The enzyme specificity was trypsin allowing 1 missed cleavage, carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine (fixed), deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (variable), oxidation of methionine (variable) and an m/z error of ± 0.3 Da. The Mascot output (xml format), restricted to non-homologous protein identifications was recombined with MS profile data in Progenesis. For statistical analysis, log-transformed MS data were normalized by inter-sample abundance ratio, and differences in relative protein abundance were investigated using nonconflicting peptides only. In addition, data were normalised to yeast ADH1 to estimate protein abundances in fmol/μg protein using the Hi-N method [20].

### Publication Abstract
Mole (MSR) and fractional (FSR) synthesis rates of proteins during C2C12 myoblast differentiation are investigated. Myoblast cultures supplemented with D<sub>2</sub> O during 0-24 h or 72-96 h of differentiation are analyzed by LC-MS/MS to calculate protein FSR and MSR after samples are spiked with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1). Profiling of 153 proteins detected 70 significant (p &#x2264; 0.05, FDR &#x2264; 1%) differences in abundance between cell states. Early differentiation is enriched by clusters of ribosomal and heat shock proteins, whereas later differentiation is associated with actin filament binding. The median (first-third quartile) FSR (%/h) during early differentiation 4.1 (2.7-5.3) is approximately twofold greater than later differentiation 1.7 (1.0-2.2), equating to MSR of 0.64 (0.38-1.2) and 0.28 (0.1-0.5) fmol&#xa0;h<sup>-1</sup> &#xa0;&#xb5;g<sup>-1</sup> total protein, respectively. MSR corresponds more closely with abundance data and highlights proteins associated with glycolytic processes and intermediate filament protein binding that are not evident among FSR data. Similarly, MSR during early differentiation accounts for 78% of the variation in protein abundance during later differentiation, whereas FSR accounts for 4%. Conclusively, the interpretation of protein synthesis data differs when reported in mole or fractional terms, which has consequences when studying the allocation of cellular resources.
