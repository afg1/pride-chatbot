### Title
PSCK9 knockdown in EndoC-bH1 cells at 72 h (DIA secretome experiment)

### Description
EndoC-bH1 cells were incubated with control siRNA or PCSK9 siRNA for 72 hours. The experiment was powered based PCSK9 knockdown in the pilot experiment [PXDxxx (PE083)]. Sample size: 12x12.

### Sample Protocol
Cell conditioned media was thawed on ice and was concentrated down to ~100 μL using Amicon® Ultra-15 3k MWCO centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma). Buffer exchange into PreOmics iST lysis buffer was performed, followed by incubation at 95°C for 10 min for reduction and alkylation. Protein amounts were normalized using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts from each condition was subjected to enzymatic cleavage for 3 hours by adding equal amounts of endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin in a 1:50 (wt/wt) enzyme:protein ratio. De-salting and purification were performed according to the PreOmics iST protocol on a styrene divinylbenzene reversed-phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) sorbent. Peptides were loaded onto a ReproSil-Pur 120 C18AQ 1.9um in-house packed to a 5um tip 75u ID x 360u x 50 cm bed volume column using a Thermo EASY-nLC1200 connected through a Nanospray Flex Ion Source, integrated with a Column Oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach, Germany) maintained at 50°C.The gradient had a flow rate of 300nl/min throughout a non-linear gradient. Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer was operated in Data Independent Acquistion Positive mode where the windows covered 350-1650 m/z space taken into account heavily dense peptide regions for window sizing.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using SpectronautTM V14.10 with parameters in PE002.setup.
