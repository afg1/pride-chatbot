### Title
In vitro evaluation of MiPro cultuturing model

### Description
The human stool samples were collected for establishing and evaluating the MiPro culturing model. Metaproteomics were used to evaluate the model performance in maintaining microbiome composition and functions.

### Sample Protocol
The culture samples were lysed with 4% SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis
