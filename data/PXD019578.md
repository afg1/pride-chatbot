### Title
Reproductive cooperation - Main study C4PR_LIV

### Description
By successfully tracking individual maternal food intake and milk investment, we show that offspring gain more milk from their own mother, particularly when partner mothers are unrelated and when offspring born second experience strong competition from older pups. Unrelated partner mothers are less efficient, requiring more energy than sisters to rear communal broods of equivalent mass. Further, while unrelated partners provide more equal (but not proportional) investment in the brood, individual fitness gains from investment are much greater and more equal between sisters. Our results show that cryptic kin discrimination in maternal investment provides a strong selective advantage for the choice of close relatives as communal rearing partners, reducing costs and potential exploitation of effort when partners were closely matched.

### Sample Protocol
Pup tissue, maternal milk and urine samples were digested with trypsin or LysC as previously described (ref). Samples were analysed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC™ nano system (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead) coupled to a QExactive-Hf™ or a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).  The sample was loaded onto the trapping column (Thermo Scientific, PepMap100, C18, 300 μm X 5 mm), using partial loop injection, for seven minutes at a flow rate of 4 μL/min with 0.1% (v/v) FA.  The sample was resolved on the analytical column (Easy-Spray C18 75 µm x 500 mm 2 µm column) using a gradient of 97% A (0.1% formic acid) 3% B (99.9% ACN 0.1% formic acid) to 60% A 40% B over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 300 nL min-1.  The data-dependent program used for data acquisition consisted of a 70,000 resolution full-scan MS scan (AGC set to 1e6 ions with a maximum fill time of 200ms) the 3 most abundant peaks were selected for MS/MS using a 35,000 resolution scan (AGC set to 1e5 ions with a maximum fill time of 50ms) with an ion selection window of 1.2 m/z and a normalised collision energy of 30.  To avoid repeated selection of peptides for MSMS the program used a 15 second dynamic exclusion window

### Data Protocol
Peak areas under the curve (AUC) for both the light and heavy peptide forms were extracted using Skyline (version 4.1.0.11796
