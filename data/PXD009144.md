### Title
Identification of proteomic markers in head and neck cancer using MALDI-MS Imaging, LC-MS/MS and IHC

### Description
Purpose The heterogeneity of squamous cell carcinoma tissue complicates diagnosis and an individualized therapy to a great extent. Therefore it is of utmost importance to spatially characterize this tissue heterogeneity and to identify appropriate biomarkers. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can analyze spatially resolved tissue biopsies on a molecular level.   Experimental design MALDI MSI of snap frozen tissues as well as of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) were used to analyze m/z values localized in tumor and non-tumor regions. Peptide identification was performed by using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results In both FFPE and frozen tissue specimen seven characteristic masses of the tumor epithelial region were found identified. Using LC-MS/MS, the peaks were identified as Vimentin, Keratin type II, Nucleolin, Heat shock protein 90, Prelamin-A/C, Junction plakoglobin and PGAM1. Finally, Vimentin, Nucleolin and PGAM1 were verified with IHC.  Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The combination of MALDI MSI, LC-MS/MS and subsequent IHC is an appropriate tool to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of tissue as well as to identify new representative biomarkers for a more individualized therapy.

### Sample Protocol
In-solution digest The samples were resolubilized in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) in trifluoroethanol/water 50/50 (v/v). Cysteine thiols were reduced for 1 h at 55Â°C by addition of 2 ÂµL of 500 mM TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and further carbamidomethylated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark by addition of 2 Âµl of 625 mM iodoacetamide (IAA). Subsequently the samples were further cleaned up by methanol-chloroform-water precipitation using the protocol of Wessel and FlÃ¼gge (1984; PMID: 6731838). Protein precipitates were resolubilized in 100 mM TEAB and digested overnight (18 h) with a Trypsin+LysC mixture (Promega) at a protein to protease ratio of 25:1. Samples were evaporated in a SpeedVac, resolubilized in 25ÂµL of 0.05% TFA in H2O/ACN 98/2 (v/v) filtered through Ultrafree-MC 0.2 Âµm PTFE membrane spin filters (Merck-Millipore). The filtrate was transferred to HPLC vials and injected into the LC-MS/MS instrument. Each sample was measured in duplicate (2 analytical replicates).  LC-MS/MS analysis LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Ultimate 3000 nano RSLC system connected to a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptide trapping for 5 min on an Acclaim Pep Map 100 column (2 cm x 75 Âµm, 3 Âµm) at 5 ÂµL/min was followed by separation on an analytical Acclaim Pep Map RSLC nano column (50 cm x 75 Âµm, 2Âµm). Mobile phase gradient elution of eluent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water) mixed with eluent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 90/10 acetonitrile/water) was performed as follows: 0-4 min at 4% B, 10 min at 7% B, 40 min at 10% B, 60 min at 15% B, 80 min at 25% B, 90 min at 30% B, 110 min at 50 %B, 115 min at 60% B, 120-125 min at 96% B, 125.1-150 min at 4% B. Positively charged ions were generated at spray voltage of 2.2 kV using a stainless steel emitter attached to the Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The quadrupole/orbitrap instrument was operated in Full MS / data-dependent MS2 (Top10) mode. Precursor ions were monitored at m/z 300-1500 at a resolution of 70,000 FWHM (full width at half maximum) using a maximum injection time (ITmax) of 120 ms and an AGC (automatic gain control) target of 1e6. Precursor ions with a charge state of z=2-5 were filtered at an isolation width of m/z 1.6 amu for further HCD fragmentation at 30% normalized collision energy (NCE). MS2 ions were scanned at 17,500 FWHM (ITmax=120 ms, AGC= 2e5) using a fixed first mass of m/z 120 amu. Dynamic exclusion of precursor ions was set to 30 s and the underfill ratio was set to 1.0%. The LC-MS/MS instrument was controlled by Chromeleon 7.2, QExactive HF Tune 2.8  and Xcalibur 4.0 software.

### Data Protocol
Protein database search Tandem mass spectra were searched against the UniProt databases (2017/10/23; http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640) of Homo sapiens, using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.2 (Thermo) and the algorithms of Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK), Sequest HT (version of PD2.2) and MS Amanda 2.0. Two missed cleavages were allowed for the tryptic digestion. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Modifications were defined as dynamic Met oxidation and protein N-term acetylation as well as static Cys carbamidomethylation. At least 2 peptides per protein and a strict false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% were required for positive protein hits. The Percolator node of PD2.2 and a reverse decoy database was used for qvalue validation of spectral matches. Only rank 1 proteins and peptides of the top scored proteins were counted.
