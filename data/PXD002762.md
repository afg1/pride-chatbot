### Title
A Biomarker Panel for Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease

### Description
Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we compared pooled plasma samples from 35 patients with cGVHD obtained at a median of 103 days post-HCT and 18 patients without cGVHD obtained at matched timepoints to identify biomarkers for cGVHD.

### Sample Protocol
We compared three pools of plasma in the same proteomic experiment. Pool 1 contained plasma from 17 patients with de novo cGVHD available at the onset of clinical symptoms, pool 2 contained plasma from 18 controls without cGVHD (collected at a similar time point as cGVHD samples), and pool 3 contained plasma from 18 patients with progressive cGVHD.  LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
The acquired LC-MS/MS data (34) were analyzed using two approaches. In the first approach, Proteome Discoverer™ version 1.4 was used for data analysis.  In the second approach, the mass spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot human proteome database (release 2015_02, 20192 entries) using Mascot™ version 2.2.
