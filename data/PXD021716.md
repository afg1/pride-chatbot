### Title
Genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying flower induction in apple

### Description
The proteomic profiling of apple spur buds aimed to reveal the proteomic differences  between the trees with (ON) and without (OFF) crop load.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts from apple buds were analzyed using nanoscale liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS). The analysis was performed on an EASY-nLC 1000 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer using an EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).

### Data Protocol
MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.10) 25 in the label-free quantification (LFQ) mode with carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and n-terminal acetylation as variable modifications.
