### Title
Crab Scylla paramamosain gill LC-MSMS

### Description
The project aims to reveal the proteomic responses of crab Scylla paramamosain to high and low salinity stress.

### Sample Protocol
Proteome analysis was conducted by integration of SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. Proteins in gill tissues were extracted using 8 M urea and a sonication method, and then purified using a ReadyPrep 2D-cleanup kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The concentration of proteins was quantified using a RC DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). For each sample, 100 μg of purified protein was used and separated in SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained using Blue-Silver Coomassie and then destained with 1% acetic acid. Each gel was divided into five fractions based on their intensity and molecular weight. Small gel pieces were further destained with 50% MeOH/ 50 mM NH4HCO3, MilliQ water, 100% acetonitrile (ACN), 100 mM NH4HCO3 and 100% ACN in order. Then, reduction and alkylation of proteins were conducted. The protein samples were subsequently digested for 16 h at 37°C using sequencing-grade 20 ng/µl trypsin in 50 mM NH4HCO3. Peptides were extracted from gel with 25 mM NH4HCO3, 5% formic acid in ACN, 100% ACN in order, and desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, USA). Five fractions of peptide samples were combined and dried in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and quantitation were analyzed using MaxQuant v1.6.5.0 in Label-free Quantification (LFQ) mode with default settings. A total of 68,564 putative protein sequences from transcriptome of S. paramamosain were set as reference database.

### Publication Abstract
Osmoregulation and osmoconformation are two mechanisms through which aquatic animals adapt to salinity fluctuations. The euryhaline crab Scylla paramamosain, being both an osmoconformer and osmoregulator, is an excellent model organism to investigate salinity adaptation mechanisms in brachyurans. In the present study, we used transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to investigate the response of S. paramamosain to salinity stress. Crabs were transferred from a salinity of 25 ppt to salinities of 5 ppt or 33 ppt for 6&#xa0;h and 10&#xa0;days. Data from both approaches revealed that exposure to 5 ppt resulted in upregulation of ion transport and energy metabolism associated genes. Notably, acclimation to low salinity was associated with early changes in gene expression for signal transduction and stress response. In contrast, exposure to 33 ppt resulted in upregulation of genes related to amino acid metabolism, and amino acid transport genes were upregulated only at the early stage of acclimation to this salinity. Our study reveals contrasting mechanisms underlying osmoregulation and osmoconformation within the salinity range of 5-33 ppt in the mud crab, and provides novel candidate genes for osmotic signal transduction, thereby providing insights on understanding the salinity adaptation mechanisms of brachyuran crabs.
