### Title
human plasma sample parallel reaction monitoring

### Description
Women are vulnerable to cervical diseases including normal control, HSIL and early stage cervical carcinoma . The parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (PRM-MS) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the candidate differential proteins identified in our previous studies and to link them with HPV status. The integration of HPV status with candidate serum markers is expected to efficiently narrow down the high risk population and provide sufficient clinical information for early diagnosis and effective therapy.

### Sample Protocol
62 samples were collected from the three groups of patients described above, including 20 samples from the normal control group, 16 samples from the HSIL or CIN II/III groups and 26 samples from early stage cervical squamous carcinoma groups. The collection method has been previously described (18, 19). Tissue sample preparation and enzyme digestion Samples were made to 10 mM DTT final concentration, IAA was added at a final concentration of 50 mM, and samples were incubated for 40 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by the addition of 100 mM ABC and LysC (100:1) and incubation for 4 h at 37°C. Trypsin (50:1) was added followed by another incubation for 16-18 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding an appropriate amount of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). After hydrolysis, peptides were desalted using a C18 cartridge and dried, followed by resuspension in 0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptide concentration was determined by measuring the extinction at 280 nm in a UV spectrophotometer. Nano liquid chromatography (nLC) Equal amounts of digested peptides from each sample were mixed with equal amounts of isotope-labeled standard peptide (DSPSAPVNVTVR, underlined V represents the site of heavy isotope labeling). nLC separation was performed on an Easy nLC 1200 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Chromatographic columns were equilibrated with 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid-water). After loading samples onto the trapping column, gradient separation was performed at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile) according to the following scheme: 5-35% (0-45 min), 35-100 (45-48 min) and 100% (48-60 min).

### Data Protocol
PRM was performed on a Q-Exactive Plus instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). The parameters of the first-level full MS scan were as follows: 1) Duration of analysis: 60 min; 2) Detection mode: positive ion; 3) First-level mass spectra scanning range: 400-1,100 m/z; 4) Mass spectrometer resolution: 70,000 (at m/z = 200; 5) AGC target: 3e6; 6) Maximum IT: 250 ms. After completion of the first-level full MS scan, a total of 20 PRM MS2 scans were carried out using the following parameters: 1) Isolation window: 2 Th; 2) Mass spectrometer resolution: 35,000 (at m/z = 200); 3) AGC target: 3e6; 4) Maximum IT: 200 ms; 5) MS2 activation type: HCD; 6) normalized collision energy;  LC-PRM/MS analysis was performed for each of the 62 samples once and Skyline (version 3.5.0) was used for the analysis of the PRM raw files. The relative peptide ratios in the cancer vs control samples were calculated by dividing the mean of the peptide area in the cancer samples by the mean of the peptide area in the normal control samples. A Student’s t-test was used to estimate the significance of the peptide changes observed. Parallel reaction monitoring data were also processed with Skyline software after selecting transitions with dotp values matching the library spectrum with a value of ≥ 0.9.
