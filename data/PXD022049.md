### Title
Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the thiol proteome from Bacillus cereus grown in anaerobiosisTandem mass spectrometry analysis of the thiol proteome from Bacillus cereus grown in anaerobiosis

### Description
Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of Bacillus cereus samples grown in anaerobiosis for identifying the redox state of the thiols.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, treated with chemical reagents for fixing the cysteine modification or untreated, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed, spectral counts and NSAF were extracted and compared.
