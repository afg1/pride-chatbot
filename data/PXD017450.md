### Title
High-Throughput Stool Metaproteome Pipeline

### Description
New pipeline for processing stool samples for metaproteomics in a high-throughput and reproducible fashion.

### Sample Protocol
The entire processing pipeline is detailed in the upcoming paper. Briefly, samples are resolubulized, lysed, and processed using S-trap and robot desalting. The resulting peptides are then isobarically labeled.

### Data Protocol
Samples were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 with Sequest algorithm and Percolator
