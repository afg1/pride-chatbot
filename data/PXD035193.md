### Title
Impact of bacteriocin production on cellular metabolism of Staphylococcus aureus

### Description
Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the production of bacteriocins are widespread amongst bacterial isolates and are important genetic determinants of competitive fitness. Staphylococci produce a tremendous diversity of compounds and the corresponding gene clusters (Staphylococcal Antibiosis Islands - SAbIs) are frequently associated with mobile genetic elements, suggesting acquisition and loss of biosynthetic capacity. Pharmaceutical biology has shown that transfer of BGCs between bacterial species is frequently challenging and production by the heterologous hosts often depends on optimal precursor supplies. It is unknown if transfer of SAbIs has similar effects. We modelled SAbItransfer between closely related S. aureus strains based on the SAbI encoding the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) Micrococcin P1 (MP1). Our results indicate that acquisition of SAbIs can represent a mixed blessing for the recipient strain and its genetic and metabolic predispositions are of crucial importance to integrate bacteriocin production into the cellular metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
Strains were grown over night, inoculated in fresh medium to OD600=0.1 and grown for 5 h at 37°C. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in SDS buffer (4% w/v in 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8). Cells were homogenised, and 10 mM DTT was added to the supernatant, incubated for 45 min shaking at 650 rpm at room temperature, followed by addition of 5.5 mM IAA and incubated for 45 min at RT with shaking at 650 rpm in the dark. After centrifugation, proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with acetone/methanol, washed twice and resolved in denaturation buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 10 mM Tris/HCl; pH 7.5).  Proteins were digested in solution with trypsin, and desalted peptides were separated on an Easy-nLC 1200 system coupled to a quadrupole Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated using an 87 minute segmented gradient from 10-33-50-90% of HPLC solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) in HPLC solvent A (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data‐dependent mode, collecting MS spectra in the Orbitrap mass analyzer (60,000 resolution, 300-1750 m/z range) with an automatic gain control (AGC) set to standard and a maximum ion injection time set to automatic. The 20 most intense precursor ions were sequentially fragmented with a normalized collision energy of 28 in each scan cycle using HCD fragmentation. In all measurements, sequenced precursor masses were excluded from further selection for 30 s. MS/MS spectra were recorded with a resolution of 15,000, whereby fill time was set to automatic.

### Data Protocol
Acquired MS spectra were processed with MaxQuant software package version 1.6.14.0 with integrated Andromeda search engine. Database search was performed against a Staphylococcus aureus (allStrains) database of 216,059 entries, and 286 commonly observed contaminants. Endoprotease trypsin was defined as protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages. Oxidation of methionine, and protein N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as fixed modification. Initial maximum allowed mass tolerance was set to 4.5 parts per million (ppm) for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions. Peptide, protein and modification site identifications were reported at an FDR of 0.01, estimated by the target-decoy approach. The iBAQ and LFQ algorithms were enabled, as was the “match between runs” option.
