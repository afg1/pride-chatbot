### Title
Genetic downregulation of Dnm2 as a therapeutic approach in a murine model of X-linked myotubular myopathy (Mtm1-/y)

### Description
In this study, we performed mass spectometry on tibialis anterior muscle of male mice. WT and Mtm1 deficient (Mtm1-/y) mice as well as on Dnm2+/- mice and on Mtm1-/y mice crossed with Dnm2+/- (Mtm1-/yDnm2+/-) were analyzed. A longitudinal follow up was established by analyzing all the genotypes at E18.5, 2w and 7w.

### Sample Protocol
TA muscles were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 1mM DTT and complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein mixtures were TCA-precipitated overnight at 4°C. Samples were then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. Pellet were washed twice with 1 mL cold acetone and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Washed pellet were then urea-denatured with 8 M urea in Tris-HCl 0.1 mM, reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 30 minutes, and then alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes in the dark. Both reduction and alkylation were performed at room temperature and under agitation (850 rpm). Double digestion was performed with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) at a ratio 1/100 (enzyme/proteins) in 8 M urea for 4h, followed by an overnight modified trypsin digestion (Promega) at a ratio 1/100 (enzyme/proteins) in 2 M urea. Both Lys-C and Trypsin digestions were performed at 37°C. Peptide mixtures were then desalted on C18 spin-column and dried on Speed-Vacuum before LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified by database searching using Maxquant 1.6.6.0 and Mus musculus database (Uniprot Proteome database). Oxidation (M) was set as variable modification, and Carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modification. Peptides were filtered with a false discovery rate (FDR) at 1%, The Label-Free Quantitative values were processed using Perseus 1.6.6.

### Publication Abstract
Omics analyses are powerful methods to obtain an integrated view of complex biological processes, disease progression, or therapy efficiency. However, few studies have compared different disease forms and different therapy strategies to define the common molecular signatures representing the most significant implicated pathways. In this study, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry to profile the transcriptomes and proteomes of mouse models for three forms of centronuclear myopathies (CNMs), untreated or treated with either a drug (tamoxifen), antisense oligonucleotides reducing the level of dynamin 2 (DNM2), or following modulation of DNM2 or amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) through genetic crosses. Unsupervised analysis and differential gene and protein expression were performed to retrieve CNM molecular signatures. Longitudinal studies before, at, and after disease onset highlighted potential disease causes and consequences. Main pathways in the common CNM disease signature include muscle contraction, regeneration and inflammation. The common therapy signature revealed novel potential therapeutic targets, including the calcium regulator sarcolipin. We identified several novel biomarkers validated in muscle and/or plasma through RNA quantification, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays, including ANXA2 and IGFBP2. This study validates the concept of using multi-omics approaches to identify molecular signatures common to different disease forms and therapeutic strategies.
