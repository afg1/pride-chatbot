### Title
CK2β is a gatekeeper of focal adhesions regulating cell spreading

### Description
CK2 is an hetero-tetrameric protein made of two CK2α catalytic subunits and two regulatory CK2β subunits. The free CK2α subunit and the tetrameric holoenzyme have distinct substrate specificity profiles suggesting that the spatiotemporal organization of the individual CK2 subunits observed in living cells is crucial in the control of the many cellular processes that are governed by this pleiotropic kinase. Indeed, sub-stoichiometric expression of CK2β compared to CK2α in a subset of breast cancer tumors was correlated with the induction of EMT markers and increased epithelial cell plasticity in breast carcinoma progression. Using phosphotyrosine profiling with affinity capture and LC/MS-MS, we show that decreased expression of CK2β in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells triggers the phosphorylation of a number of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and promotes the striking activation of the FAK1-Src-PAX1 signaling pathway. Moreover, morphometric analyses also revealed that CK2β loss increases the number and the spatial distribution of focal adhesion signaling complexes. Together, our finding allows positioning CK2β as a gatekeeper for cell spreading by restraining the focal adhesion maturation and invasion of mammary epithelial cells.

### Sample Protocol
After phosphoproteins enrichment, the proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and stacked in the top of a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). After staining with R-250 Coomassie Blue (Biorad), proteins were digested in-gel using trypsin (modified, sequencing purity, Promega), as previously described (Salvetti A et al. J Proteome Res., 2016). Phosphopeptides were enriched with TiO2 beads (GL Science) in batch mode (adapted from Jensen SS et al., Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom., 2007). The resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 35 min and 120 min gradient. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 75 μm x 250 mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch).

### Data Protocol
The MS and MS/MS data were acquired by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Uniprot database (Homo Sapiens taxonomy, September 2021 version), a classical contaminants database and the corresponding reversed databases. Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable), Oxidation (M, variable), Phosphorylation (S,T,Y, variable). The Proline software was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 6 amino acids, peptide score ≥ 25, allowing to reach a false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1% as calculated on peptide-spectrum-match scores by employing the reverse database strategy). Proline was then used to perform a compilation, grouping and MS1 label-free quantification of the identified peptides and protein groups.

### Publication Abstract
CK2 is a hetero-tetrameric serine/threonine protein kinase made up of two CK2&#x3b1;/&#x3b1;' catalytic subunits and two CK2&#x3b2; regulatory subunits. The free CK2&#x3b1; subunit and the tetrameric holoenzyme have distinct substrate specificity profiles, suggesting that the spatiotemporal organization of the individual CK2 subunits observed in living cells is crucial in the control of the many cellular processes that are governed by this pleiotropic kinase. Indeed, previous studies reported that the unbalanced expression of CK2 subunits is sufficient to drive epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Moreover, sub-stoichiometric expression of CK2&#x3b2; compared to CK2&#x3b1; in a subset of breast cancer tumors was correlated with the induction of EMT markers and increased epithelial cell plasticity in breast carcinoma progression. Phenotypic changes of epithelial cells are often associated with the activation of phosphotyrosine signaling. Herein, using phosphotyrosine enrichment coupled with affinity capture and proteomic analysis, we show that decreased expression of CK2&#x3b2; in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells triggers the phosphorylation of a number of proteins on tyrosine residues and promotes the striking activation of the FAK1-Src-PAX1 signaling pathway. Moreover, morphometric analyses also reveal that CK2&#x3b2; loss increases the number and the spatial distribution of focal adhesion signaling complexes that coordinate the adhesive and migratory processes. Together, our findings allow positioning CK2&#x3b2; as a gatekeeper for cell spreading by restraining focal adhesion formation and invasion of mammary epithelial cells.
