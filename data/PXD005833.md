### Title
The Proteomic Fingerprint of Prostate Cancer in Primary Tumors and  Recurrent Lymph Node Metastases

### Description
We performed a quantitative proteome comparison on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue of metastasized and non-metastasized primary prostate cancer (PCa) and on recurrent lymph node metastases. Comparing these three sample groups, we aimed to identify proteins, that might potentially promote/supress tumor progression or metastasis formation. Proteins were quantified label-free. Proteins with interesting biological functions were followed-up by immunohistochemistry.

### Sample Protocol
Tissue specimens were harvested at the time of RPE or metastasis removal. Tissue fixation in formalin and paraffin embedding were was conducted by the Institute of Clinical Pathology of the University Medical Centre Freiburg, according to their routine procedures. For all tissue specimens, diagnosis was confirmed by experienced pathologists. All tissue specimens were processed within 20 minutes after surgical removal. After processing,samples were immediately anonymized.Hematoxylin - Eosin (HE) - stained sections of all samples were inspected under a light microscope and eligible tumor areas of invasive PCa or LNM (0.5 cm²-3.0 cm²) were marked for microdissection of consecutive sections. Paraffin blocks were cut into 10 µm sections on a microtome, put on a 37°C water bath, mounted on a glass specimen holder and dried overnight at 37 °. Deparaffinization was performed automatically, using the Medite Tissue Stainer COT 20. Tumor areas corresponding to the tumor template were cut out of the deparaffinized tissue sections to analyze with a scalpel or hollow-needle. Macrodissection was performed using ice-cooled laboratory containers. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to Standard protocols of the Institute for Clinical Pathology Freiburg.

### Data Protocol
Samples were analyzed on a Q-Exactive plus (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer, operating in data dependent aquisition mode with a top 10 method at a mass- to-charge ratio of 300 − 2000. MS data were analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.5.28 [19] with the Uniprot human database downloaded on Nov 26 th .2013, containing 20271 reviewed canonical sequences without isoforms. The analysis included an initial search with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm for mass recalibration and a main search with precursor mass and fragment mass tolerances of 6 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. The search included a fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine and no variable modifications. Tryptic cleavage specificity with up to two missed cleavages was used with a minimal peptide length of seven amino acids. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptide and protein identifications in individual analyses. Relative protein quantification was done label-free, using MaxLFQ.

### Publication Abstract
Patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) have a poorer prognosis than patients with organ-confined tumors. We strove to uncover the proteome signature of primary PCa and associated lymph node metastases (LNMs) in order to identify proteins that may indicate or potentially promote metastases formation. We performed a proteomic comparative profiling of PCa tissue from radical prostatectomy (RPE) of patients without nodal metastases or relapse at the time of surgical resection (n=5) to PCa tissue from RPE of patients who suffered from nodal relapse (n=5). For the latter group, we also included patient-matched tissue of the nodal metastases. All samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. We identified and quantified more than 1200 proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with subsequent label-free quantification. An increase of ribosomal or proteasomal proteins in LNM (compared to corresponding PCa) became apparent, while extracellular matrix components rather decreased. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) corroborated accumulation of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 and N-myc-downstream-regulated-gene 3, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11, and protein phosphatase slingshot homolog 3 in LNM. These findings strengthen the present interest in examining PARP inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive PCa. IHC also corroborated increased abundance of retinol dehydrogenase 11 in metastasized primary PCa compared to organ-confined PCa. Generally, metastasizing primary tumors were characterized by an enrichment of proteins involved in cellular lipid metabolic processes with concomitant decrease of cell adhesion proteins. This study highlights the usefulness of a combined proteomic-IHC approach to explore novel aspects in tumor biology. Our initial results open novel opportunities for follow-up studies.
