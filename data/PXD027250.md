### Title
Identification of potential of new therapeutic approaches  for JAK2 V617F mutant patients

### Description
n patients with PMF, excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines results in fibrotic changes in bone marrow and diminishes the quality of life of the affected patients due to systemic symptoms  long-term ruxolitinib therapy may reverse or markedly delay BM fibrosis progression in advanced MF suggests kavasincha 2018

### Sample Protocol
Analysis was performed by SWATH MS using a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (Sciex) couple on-line to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex). The analytical column was an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 NV  column (Thermo) and the guard column was an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 cartridge (Thermo). Peptides were eluted using a gradient from a 98% water, 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid buffer to a 80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.1% formic acid buffer over 120 minutes at 0.3uL/min.

### Data Protocol
Raw spectral data files were analysed using openSWATH (version 2.0.0) using the pan human library (11) followed by scoring and filtering using pyProphet (version 0.18.3). Resultant output files were combined using the MSproteomicstools feature alignment script. Further filtering and protein abundance summarisation and normalisation were performed in R (version 3.4.1) using the packages SWATH2stats and MSstats from Bioconductor (release 3.5).
