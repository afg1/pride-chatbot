### Title
Quantitative analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana leaf acetylome after treatment with deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and apicidin

### Description
Lysine acetylation is a common post-translational modification in eukaryotes and prokaryotes which is known to be involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, such as transcriptional activation, metabolic signaling, and energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, its role in plant primary metabolism, and photosynthesis in particular, is not well understood. Lysine acetylation is catalyzed by acetyltransferases (KATs) and removed by corresponding deacetylases (KDACs). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes for at least 16 KATs and 18 KDACs, belonging to seven different gene families. The cellular functions of these enzymes have been explored only partially, describing effects of single enzymes and their interaction with specific targets. In this dataset we investigated the effect of two distinct lysine deacetylase inhibitors on protein lysine acetylation in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves on a proteome-wide scale. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of class I and II KDACs, and apicidin, an inhibitor of class I KDACs, were applied in solution to leaf strips to induce KDAC inhibition. Proteins were extracted and digested using an adapted FASP procedure, peptides were dimethyl-labeled, ZIC-HILIC fractionated and lysine-acetylated peptides were antibody-enriched. Peptide identification and quantitative data analysis was carried out using MaxQuant.

### Sample Protocol
2 g of mature Arabidopsis leaves from 4 week old rosettes were cut into 2 mm broad strips with a razor-blade and were vacuum-infiltrated in a petri-dish three times for 5 minutes with either 5 µM apicidin, 5 µM trichostatin A or a buffer control of 1 mM MES buffer pH 5.5 containing an equal amount of DMSO, as used for inhibitor stock solutions. The infiltrated strips were incubated for 4 h in MES buffer in the light (100 µmol quanta m-2 s-) and subsequently dried on tissue paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experiments were performed with three independent biological replicates consisting of pools from several independent individuals with separate controls for each inhibitor treatment. In the case of TSA a fourth replicate was measured but used only for peptide identification but not quantification due to inhomogenous labeling and resulting high variability.  Frozen leaf material was ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle and extracted using an adapted filter-assisted sample preparation (FASP) protocol (Wisniewski et al., Nature Methods, 2009; Lassowskat et al., 2017). Digested peptides were dimethyl labeled on C18 Sep-Pak classic columns (Waters) as previously described (Boersema et al., Nature Protocols, 2009; Lassowskat et al., 2017), using light (+28 Da) and medium labels (+32 Da), respectively. For replicate three of the TSA experiment the labels were reversed. Equal amounts of labeled peptides were pooled for each replicate and the solvent evaporated in a vacuum-centrifuge. For off-line fractionation the dried peptides were separated on a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (Merck) attached to an FPLC (Äkta, GE Healthcare) and separated with a linear gradient from 85% acetonitrile to 30% (A: 5 mM ammonium acetate, 95% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid; B: 5 mM ammonium acetate, 0.07% formic acid) at a flow-rate of 1 ml min-1 . We collected 1.5 mL fractions and pooled them into 6-7 fractions equalizing peptide concentration based on the UV chromatogram. Kac peptide enrichment of ZIC-HILIC fractions was performed as previously described (Hartl et al., Methods in Mol. Biology, 2015). After enrichment the eluted peptides were desalted using C18 Stagetips (Rappsilber et al., Nature Protocols, 2007) or SDB Stagetips (Kulak et al., Nature Methods, 2014) and evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge. Total proteome (“input”) and acetyl lysine enriched samples were subjected to LC-MS analysis. Peptides were separated with an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher) on 16 - 20 cm C18 columns (3 µm bead size) with a 120 min segmented linear gradient. Peptides were analyzed with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a Top10 method (apicidin) or with a Q Exactive Plus and Top15 method (TSA). For the apicidin experiment a technical replicate was additionally measured on an Orbitrap Elite system (Thermo Fisher).

### Data Protocol
The resulting mass spectrometry data were analyzed with MaxQuant (1.5.2.8). MS/MS spectra were searched with the integrated Andromeda search engine against the TAIR10 proteome (35,386 entries) and 248 common contaminant proteins. Light and medium dimethylation of lysines and peptide N-termini were set as labels. Trypsin specificity was required and a maximum of two or four missed cleavages allowed for total proteome and enriched samples, respectively. Minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as fixed, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Acetylation of lysines was added as a variable modification for the enriched samples. Allowed mass deviation was 4.5 ppm for peptides and 20 ppm for fragments. Peptide-spectrum-matches and proteins were retained if they were below a false discovery rate of 1%.

### Publication Abstract
Histone deacetylases have central functions in regulating stress defenses and development in plants. However, the knowledge about the deacetylase functions is largely limited to histones, although these enzymes were found in diverse subcellular compartments. In this study, we determined the proteome-wide signatures of the RPD3/HDA1 class of histone deacetylases in <i>Arabidopsis</i> Relative quantification of the changes in the lysine acetylation levels was determined on a proteome-wide scale after treatment of <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves with deacetylase inhibitors apicidin and trichostatin A. We identified 91 new acetylated candidate proteins other than histones, which are potential substrates of the RPD3/HDA1-like histone deacetylases in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, of which at least 30 of these proteins function in nucleic acid binding. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that histone deacetylase 14 (HDA14) is the first organellar-localized RPD3/HDA1 class protein found to reside in the chloroplasts and that the majority of its protein targets have functions in photosynthesis. Finally, the analysis of HDA14 loss-of-function mutants revealed that the activation state of RuBisCO is controlled by lysine acetylation of RuBisCO activase under low-light conditions.
