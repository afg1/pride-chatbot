### Title
Profilling of aggregated proteome in human control and AD cases

### Description
Analyzing and comparing proteome profiling between human control and AD cases will be beneficial to understand the molecular changes of insoluble fractions of AD cases.

### Sample Protocol
The brain tissues were lysed, digested and labeled with 16 different TMT tags. The TMT labeled peptides were equally mixed, desalted and fractionated into 80 fractions on a RP-HPLC column (4.6 mm x 250 mm) under basic pH condition. Each fraction was further separated on a reverse phase column (30 cm X 75 µm, 1.9 μm C18 resin) during a 2.5h gradient of 12-36% buffer B (buffer A: 0.2% formic acid, 3% DMSO; buffer B: buffer A plus 65% ACN) and analyzed by Q exactive HF (Thermo Scientific) with one MS scan and up to 20 data-dependent high resolution MS/MS scans.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS raw files are processed using the JUMP searching engine against UniProt human database. Searches were performed using 6 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions due to JUMP’s auto mass correction function and 15ppm for fragment ions, allowing up to two missed trypsin cleavage sites. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (+304.2071453 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were used for static modifications and the dynamic modifications include oxidation of methionine residues (+15.99492 Da). The assigned peptides are filtered by minimal peptide length, maximum mis-cleavages, mass-to-charge accuracy and matching scores. The peptides are then divided into groups according to peptide length, trypticity, modification, miscleavage, and charge and then further filtered by matching scores to reduce protein or phosphopeptide FDR to below 1%. Proteins or phosphopeptides were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matched PSMs using our in-house software.
