### Title
Why consumers prefer to eat green Friariello Pepper: Variations biological systems during the ripening fruit.

### Description
Evaluation of changes in the protein and metabolite profile along the ripening of Friariello pepper

### Sample Protocol
Three fruits collected from 10 plants were named Green (G), Green/Red (G/R), and Red (R) in agreement to the ripening level. Each sample was subjected to a 12% SDSâ€“PAGE gel electrophoresis in triplicate. SDS-PAGE bands (horizontal slices) were excised from the gel lane and destained by using three consecutive cycles of 0.1 M NH4HCO3 at pH 8.0 and acetonitrile (ACN), followed by a reduction and alkylation protocol. Finally, the gel pieces were subjected to the enzymatic hydrolysis by covering them with a solution of sequencing grade modified trypsin. Peptide mixtures were eluted, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in 2% ACN acidified with 0.1% formic acid (HCOOH) previous to the LC-MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS were performed by Q-TOF instrument ad raw files were processed by MASCOT platform
