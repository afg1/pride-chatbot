### Title
Co-immunoprecipitation and LC-ESI-MS/MS of Arabidopsis thaliana ABCE2 protein

### Description
ATP-Binding Cassette E (ABCE) proteins dissociate cytoplasmic ribosomes after translation terminates, and contribute to ribosome recycling, thus linking translation termination to initiation. This function has been demonstrated to be essential in animals, fungi, and archaea, but remains unexplored in plants. In most species, ABCE is encoded by a single-copy gene; by contrast, Arabidopsis thaliana has two ABCE paralogs, of which ABCE2 seems to conserve the ancestral function. We isolated apiculata7-1 (api7-1), the first viable, hypomorphic allele of ABCE2, which has a pleiotropic morphological phenotype reminiscent of mutations affecting ribosome biogenesis factors and ribosomal proteins. We also studied api7-2, a null, recessive lethal allele of ABCE2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ABCE2 physically interacts with components of the translation machinery. An RNA-seq study of the api7-1 mutant showed increased responses to iron and sulfur starvation. We also found increased transcript levels of genes related to auxin signaling and metabolism. Our results support for the first time a conserved role for ABCE proteins in translation in plants, as previously shown for the animal, fungal, and archaeal lineages. In Arabidopsis, the ABCE2 protein seems important for general growth and vascular development, likely due to an indirect effect through auxin metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
For protein extraction, 700 mg of whole api7-1 35Spro:ABCE2:YFP seedlings were collected 10 das per biological replicate. The tissue was crosslinked with 1 phosphate-saline buffer containing 1% (v/v) formaldehyde as previously described (Poza-Viejo et al., 2019). For protein extraction, the tissue was ground to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen and then resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.1% [v/v] IGEPAL CA-630 [Sigma-Aldrich]; 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich]; 150 mM NaCl; and a cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Sigma-Aldrich]) using a vortexer. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 4°C and the supernatants were used as protein extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with the µMACS GFP Isolation Kit (Milteny Biotec) using protein extracts from three biological replicates. The immunoprecipitation of the ABCE2:YFP fusion protein was checked by western blotting using an anti-GFP-HRP antibody (Milteny Biotec), and the WesternSure chemiluminiscent substrate on a C-DiGit Blot Scanner (LI·COR). The co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed by liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (CNB) Proteomics facility (Madrid, Spain).

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched against Araport11 using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, http://www.matrixscience.com/). Peptide sequences identified with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% were considered statistically valid.
