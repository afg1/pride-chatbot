### Title
Unravelling the layering of microbial community, proteins and chemical structure in aerobic granules

### Description
Nearly all bacteria live in microbial assemblages such as biofilms and granules with a continuum of chemical gradients. Each of these layers provide a niche selective for specific bacteria and functions. A gentle extraction approach based on a cation exchange resin and defined shear was employed to collect single layers in microbial granules for microbial and chemical analysis. The use of an existing cation-exchange resin for gradual biomass disintegration, combined with NGS and proteome analysis have revealed a promising approach for investigating the identity and functions in multilayered biofilm structures.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction was performed using a liquid-liquid extraction. Samples were digested using in-gel digestion and were subsequently desalted and analysed by automated liquid chromatograph-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
Q-exactive RAW data files were converted to mzML files using MSConvert, and processed using Mascot (v2.5.1) (Matrix Science, London, UK), searching against the NCBIprot database (2020-12-12), with a peptide tolerance of ±1.2 Da and a MS/MS tolerance of ± 0.6 Da.
