### Title
The mode of action of antimicrobial agents albofungins in eradicating penicillins and cephalosporins-resistant Vibrio parahaemolyticus biofilm

### Description
In the present study, we investigated albofungin’s antibacterial, biofilm inhibition, and eradication activity as well as its potential mode of action against drug-resistant Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

### Sample Protocol
After collecting the samples, the cell pellet was suspended in 300 μL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0), and sonicated for 5 min. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,USA). After protein quantification, samples were further precipitated using four volumes of cool acetone overnight and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The PreOmics iST-PreOn kit (PreOmics, Planegg, Germany) was used to digest and purify the dried pellet on the automated PreON machine (PreOmics, Planegg, Germany).

### Data Protocol
The data were converted into MGF format files and processed database search using the PEAKS Studio software version X pro.
