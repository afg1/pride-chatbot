### Title
Proteomic study on the lymphocytes from pregnant Wistar rats females treated with immunosuppressive regimen

### Description
Kidney transplantation remains the optimal therapeutical option for end stage kidney disease. Current immunosuppressive regimens are efficient in combating acute kidney rejection. However, the insight in chronic kidney allograft injury remains limited. Simultaneously, pregnancy in kidney recipients appears more prevalent than during dialysis treatment. Due to ethical issues comprehensive studies on the impact of current immunosuppressive regimens on pregnancy are challenging. Omics- technology enables the systemic insight into biology both of immunity and pregnancy beyond up-to-date collected knowledge. The aim of the study was to investigate the proteomic status of lymphocytes obtained from pregnant female rats under immunosuppressive treatment. The group of 10 pregnant Wistar rat females, 5 of which treated with tacrolimus, mofetil mycophenolate and glicocorticosteroids, 5 used as control. The lymphocytes were obtained and analyzed with mass-spectrometry. The outcomes were verified statistically in terms of proteins up- and down regulation.

### Sample Protocol
Wistar rat females were used in the experiment, 5 received immunosuppressive protocol (TAC, MMF, and GCS), and five were treated as a control. Males were used for mating only. (Purchased from a licensed breeder — Center of Experimental Medicine, Medical University in Bialystok, Poland). This study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee for Experiments on Animals in Szczecin (No. 12/2013, dated October 24, 2013). At the start of the experiments, the age of rats was 12 weeks. The experiments were performed using the pharmaceutical form of each drug. The animals received drugs by oral gavage at a dose volume of 5 ml/kg daily. As mentioned, five rats did not receive treatment. They formed a control group and were given the vehicle and olive oil under identical conditions as others used in experimental rats. The drug doses were based on data available in the literature, as follows: tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas, Tokyo, Japan): 4 mg/kg/day; mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Roche, Basel, Switzerland): 20 mg/kg/day; prednisone (Encorton; Polfa, Warsaw, Poland): 4 mg/kg/day. The animals received medication every 24 h for approximately five weeks (2 weeks after the acclimatization period before mating — when placed with males 1:1 in separate cages — and later after mating during three weeks of pregnancy). After delivery, the treatment was stopped. The dams were sacrificed at weaning (day 21 after delivery) — we decided not to euthanize them earlier than their offspring had to stay alive for further studies. The female rats were euthanized by pentobarbital sodium (Polpharma) injection administered intraperitoneally at 40 mg/kg body weight. The spleen was further cut into slices and pressed through nylon to RPMI‐1640 medium with phenol red and L‐glutamine. The liquid was transferred into a centrifuge tube containing the same volume of lymphocytes separation medium and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min at room temperature. The middle cloud layer was placed in a lymphocytes isolation medium and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in an RPMI‐1640 medium. Cell suspensions at a density of 2 × 106 were placed in wells — 0.5 ml of cell suspension in 1 ml of the incubation medium. The incubation medium consisted of RPMI, 10% bovine serum, 50 μg of gentamicin, and increasing amounts of concanavalin A (ConA — 0; 2; 5 μg/ml). Lymphocytes were incubated on wells plates for 72 h at 37 °C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After the incubation, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The cell pellets were harvested and frozen at -70 °C until further analyses. The pellets from suspensions stimulated with 5 μg/ml ConA were chosen for further proteomic analyses. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis in a Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) procedure with proteolytic digestion by LysC/Trypsin mix. Each sample was mixed with the lysis solution containing 1% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer at 280 nm, and about 100 µg of each sample was transferred to separate 10 kDa Microcon filters (Merck-Millipore, Burlington, MA). Samples were later processed according to standard FASP procedure. Briefly, filters were washed multiple times with the solution containing 8M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 by centrifugation at 10 000 g. Next, proteins were alkylated by 20 min incubation in darkness at room temperature with the 55mM iodoacetamide solution in the urea buffer. Filters were further washed with the urea buffer, followed by 50 mM Tris-HCl to prepare proteins for digestion. LysC/Trypsin mix was added to samples in a 1:50 weight ratio, and samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. After peptide elution with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 µg of peptides from each sample were desalted on STAGE Tips containing Empore C18 resin (3M, Maplewood, MN). In the final step, peptides were eluted from STAGE Tips with 60% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid in the water, and concentrated to 30 µl in a SpeedVac.

### Data Protocol
Database search was carried out in ProteinPilot 4.5 software (SCIEX, Framingham, MA) using the Paragon algorithm against the UniprotKB Rattus norvegicus database (version from 23.10.2019) with an automated false discovery rate (FDR) analysis with the focus on biological modifications. Only proteins identified at 1% FDR were considered valid identifications. A joint database search result group file of all samples analyzed in the study was subsequently used for the spectral library construction in the PeakView 2.2 software (SCIEX, Framingham, MA) with the exclusion of shared peptides. Files from SWATH MS runs were processed with the library as previously described. The result was used to calculate the concentration of proteins by Total Protein Approach (TPA) in a DIA-TPA experiment.

### Publication Abstract
Kidney transplantation remains the therapeutic option for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Current immunosuppressive regimens are efficient in combating acute kidney rejection. However, insights into chronic kidney allograft injury remains limited. Simultaneously, pregnancy is more common after kidney transplantation than during dialysis treatment. Due to ethical issues, comprehensive studies on the impact of immunosuppressive regimens on pregnancy are challenging. The study aimed to investigate the proteomic status of lymphocytes obtained from pregnant female rats under immunosuppressive treatment. The experiment involved a group of 10 female, pregnant Wistar rats, five of which were treated with tacrolimus, mofetil mycophenolate, and glucocorticosteroids; five were used as control. The lymphocytes were obtained and analyzed with mass spectrometry. Measurements were processed by a database search in the ProteinPilot software with a cutoff of 1% false discovery rate. The outcomes were verified statistically by a t-test (p value &lt;&#x2009;0.05) regarding proteins up- and downregulation. A total of 2082 proteins were identified in all experiments. Eight hundred five proteins were quantified in an absolute manner in a data-independent acquisition-total protein approach analysis. Ninety-five proteins were recognized as present at different concentrations in analyzed groups and were annotated to intracellular pathways. The proteins involved in nonsense-mediated decay and L13a-mediated translational silencing of ceruloplasmin expression were recognized as downregulated. The set of proteins clinically identified as acute phase proteins was upregulated. Despite the blockade of adaptive cellular immunity, the lymphocytes in the analyzed group reveal sustained proinflammatory status with decreased ability to regulate translation. This potentially affects pregnancy and immunity.
