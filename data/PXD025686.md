### Title
Analysis of interactions with truncated cytoplasmic dynein-2 intermediate chain WDR34-Q158*

### Description
Analysis of proteins interactiong with the trucated form of the cytoplasmic dynein-2 intermediate chain WDR34-Q158* using GFP-trap

### Sample Protocol
RPE1 cells ready for harvest were washed with PBS and incubated with crosslinker solution (1 mM DSP, Thermo Fisher Scientific #22585) for 30 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by adding 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Igepal and protease inhibitors (539137, Millipore). Subsequently, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were added to equilibrated GFP-Trap beads (Chromotek) and incubated overnight on a rotor at 4 °C. Next, the beads were washed three times by centrifuging at 2500 g for 5 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of washing buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA).

### Data Protocol
Proteomic analysis including Nano LC mass spectrometry and primary data analysis was done as described in Vuolo et al (2018). Dynein-2 protein abundances were normalized to the abundance of GFP in the sample.
