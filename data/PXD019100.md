### Title
Shotgun MS analysis of human malaria parasite protien PfJ2 and interactors

### Description
We identify PfJ2 interacting partners and use a chemical biology approach to specifically identify its redox partnerships.

### Sample Protocol
Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to PfJ2 was analyzed by shotgun MS to identify interacting partners. Each co-IP was digested with trypsin and analyzed in triplicate on either a Fusion or Orbitrap Elite with 60 minutes or 90 minutes of reverse-phase chromatography.  Additional analysis of redox partnerships of PfJ2 crosslinking with DVSF was performed, followed by immunoprecipication of PFJ2, SDS-PAGE separation and isolation, and in-gel digestion with trypsin. Peptides were analyzed by shotgun MS on a Fusion Lumos with 120 minutes of reverse-phase chromatography.

### Data Protocol
Peptide and protein identifications were performed using MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer with Sequest HT and Percolator, and the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline with PeptideProphet, iProphet, and ProteinProphet.
