### Title
Sorghum brewing SWATH-MS proteomics

### Description
Identification and relative quantification of proteins present during sorghum malting and in a sorghum malt and barley malt mash and boil measured by SWATH-MS.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were taken before and after sorghum malting, proteins solubilised, tryptic digest, and peptide desalt by C18 Ziptip. Samples were also taken during asmall-scale mashes of both sorghum and barley malt, soluble fraction seperated, precipitated, tryptic digest, peptide desalt by C18 Ziptip. Peptide identification was perofrmed by LC-MS/MS on TripleTof 5600, SWATH measurement with identical LC on TripleTof5600.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification using ProteinPilot 5.1 searched against all high confidence proteins from transcripts from the barley genome, sorghum genome, and manually curated contamination database. SWATH data processed using Peakview 2.1.
