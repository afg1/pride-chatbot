### Title
The muscles around the teeth of the chiton, which is able to control the teeth of the chiton, play a key role in the feeding activity of the chiton

### Description
There is a group of muscles around the chiton's teeth that control the movement of the chiton's teeth. Through research, we found that these muscles are roughly 150 microns in diameter.Muscles play a key role in the feeding activities of chitons

### Sample Protocol
First, we extract the protein from the muscle tissue, run the extracted protein solution through SDS gel electrophoresis, and send the electrophoresed gel plate to the protein spectrum analysis.Muscles play a key role in the feeding activities of chiton

### Data Protocol
Through the protein data after mass spectrometry, for a simple analysis, we found that there are many proteins related to energy metabolism in the muscles around the teeth of chitons. Through qPCR, we found that these proteins related to energy metabolism were all highly expressed.
