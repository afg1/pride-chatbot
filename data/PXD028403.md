### Title
B cell-derived GABA elicits IL-10+ macrophages and limits anti-tumor immunity

### Description
Small, soluble metabolites are not only essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighboring cells when released into the extracellular milieu. Here, we identify the metabolite and neurotransmitter GABA as a candidate signaling molecule synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells. We show that B cell-derived GABA promotes monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages which secrete IL-10 and inhibit CD8+ T cell killer function. In mice, B cell deficiency or B cell-specific inactivation of the GABA generating enzyme GAD67 enhances anti-tumor responses. Our study reveals that in addition to cytokines and membrane proteins, small metabolites derived from B lineage cells have immunoregulatory functions, which may be pharmaceutical targets allowing fine-tuning of immune responses.

### Sample Protocol
Bone marrow cells were cultured with M-CSF, and treated by DMSO or GABA for 6d. These M0 macrophages were analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer in a data-independent acquisition mode (DIA-MS). A combined peptide sample was fractionated using high-pH reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation. A sample-specific library was generated by analyzing the HPRP fractions on the same instrument in a data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA-MS).

### Data Protocol
Raw data from DDA-MS measurements were searched again the Uniprot Mus Musculus database using Proteome Discoverer v2.4. Library generation and protein quantification for the DIA-MS data was performed in Spectronaut. Another macrophage HPRP library generated from a previous experiment was included in the DIA data processing step.

### Publication Abstract
Small, soluble metabolites not only are essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighbouring cells when released into the extracellular milieu<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we identify the metabolite and neurotransmitter GABA as a candidate signalling molecule synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells. We show that B cell-derived GABA promotes monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages that secrete interleukin-10 and inhibit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killer function. In mice, B cell deficiency or B cell-specific inactivation of the GABA-generating enzyme GAD67 enhances anti-tumour responses. Our study reveals that, in addition to cytokines and membrane proteins, small metabolites derived from B-lineage cells have immunoregulatory functions, which may be pharmaceutical targets allowing fine-tuning of immune responses.
