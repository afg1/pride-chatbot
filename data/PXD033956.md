### Title
Phosphoproteomics of BYL719 (alpelisib)-Resistant T47D Human Breast Cancer Cell Line

### Description
The PI3Kalpha-specific inhibitor Alpelisib (BYL719) has been approved for the treatment of metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients in combination with Fulvestrant. After initial response, patients develop drug resistance and disease relapses. In order to identify signalling pathways contributing to the acquired resistance to BYL719 in breast cancer, we generated BYL719-resistant T47D cells and used them together with the parental cells to perform label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS using Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fitted with nanoflow reversed-phase-HPLC (Ultimate 3000 RSLC, Dionex). The nano-LC system was equipped with an Acclaim Pepmap nano-trap column (Dionex – C18, 100 Å, 75 μm × 2 cm) and an Acclaim Pepmap RSLC analytical column (Dionex – C18, 100 Å, 75 μm × 50 cm). Typically for each LC-MS/MS experiment, 10 μL of the peptide mix was loaded onto the enrichment (trap) column at an isocratic flow of 5 μL/min of 3% CH3CN containing 0.1% formic acid for 8 min before the enrichment column is switched in-line with the analytical column. The eluents used for the LC were 5% DMSO/0.1% v/v formic acid (solvent A) and 100% CH3CN/5% DMSO/0.1% formic acid v/v (solvent B). The gradient used was 3% B to 25% B for 177 min, 20% B to 40% B in 5 min, 40% B to 80% B in 5 min and maintained at 80% B for the final 5 min before equilibration for 10 min at 3% B prior to the next analysis.   The mass spectrometer was operated in positive-ionization mode with spray voltage set at 1.9 kV and source temperature at 275°C. Lockmass of 401.92272 from DMSO was used. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode MS spectra scanning from m/z 350-1550 at 120.000 resolution with AGC target of 5e5. The “top speed” acquisition method mode (3 sec cycle time) on the most intense precursor was used whereby peptide ions with charge states ≥2-5 were isolated with isolation window of 1.6 m/z and fragmented with high energy collision (HCD) mode with stepped collision energy of 30 ±5%. Fragment ion spectra were acquired in Orbitrap at 15.000 resolution.  Dynamic exclusion was activated for 30s.

### Data Protocol
MS data from DDA profiling were processed using Maxquant v1.5.5.1. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Uniprot human reference proteome FASTA file (downloaded on 21 February 2017). Digestion mode was set as trypsin. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was applied. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification; oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were considered variable modifications. False discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01.

### Publication Abstract
Utility of PI3K&#x3b1; inhibitors like BYL719 is limited by the acquisition of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance which cause disease recurrence. Several combination therapies based on PI3K inhibition have been proposed, but a way to systematically prioritize them for breast cancer treatment is still missing. By integrating published and in-house studies, we have developed in silico models that quantitatively capture dynamics of PI3K signaling at the network-level under a BYL719-sensitive versus BYL719 resistant-cell state. Computational predictions show that signal rewiring to alternative components of the PI3K pathway promote resistance to BYL719 and identify PDK1 as the most effective co-target with PI3K&#x3b1; rescuing sensitivity of resistant cells to BYL719. To explore whether PI3K pathway-independent mechanisms further contribute to BYL719 resistance, we performed phosphoproteomics and found that selection of high levels of the cell cycle regulator p21 unexpectedly promoted drug resistance in T47D cells. Functionally, high p21 levels favored repair of BYL719-induced DNA damage and bypass of the associated cellular senescence. Importantly, targeted inhibition of the check-point inhibitor CHK1 with MK-8776 effectively caused death of p21-high T47D cells, thus establishing a new vulnerability of BYL719-resistant breast cancer cells. Together, our integrated studies uncover hidden molecular mediators causing resistance to PI3K&#x3b1; inhibition and provide a framework to prioritize combination therapies for PI3K-mutant breast cancer.
