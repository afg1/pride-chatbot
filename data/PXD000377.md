### Title
Proteomic analysis of purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis

### Description
Proteomic analysis of Connaught Tuberculin 68 (PPD-CT68), a tuberculin preparation generated froM. tuberculosis, was carried out in this study. PPD-CT68 is the protein component of a commercially available tuberculin  preparation, Tubersol, which is used for tuberculin skin testing. Using a high resolution LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass  spectrometer, we identified 265 different proteins. The identified proteins were compared with those identified from  PPD M. bovis, PPD M. avium and PPD-S2 from previous mass spectrometry-based studies. In all, 142 proteins were  fo PPDs (i.e. proteins in either PPD-CT68 or PPD-S2), 37 proteins were found to be shared with M. avium PPD and 80 were  shared with M. bovis PPD. Alignment of PPD-CT68 proteins with proteins encoded by 24 lung infecting bacteria  revealed a number of similar proteins (206 bacterial proteins shared epitopes with 47 PPD-CT68 proteins), which could  potentially be involved in causing cross-reactivity
