### Title
A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL INTERACTOMICS VIEW ON THE PLANT SNRK1 KINASE COMPLEX REVEALS A KEY REGULATORY ROLE FOR THE CLASS II T6P SYNTHASE-LIKE PROTEINS – part2 TurboID-MS dataset

### Description
The plant SNF1-related kinase (SnRK1) plays a central role in energy and metabolic homeostasis. SnRK1 controls growth upon activation by energy-depleting stress conditions, while also monitoring key developmental transitions and nutrient allocation between source and sink tissues. To obtain deeper insight into the SnRK1 complex and its upstream regulatory mechanisms, we explored its protein interaction landscape in a multi-dimensional setting, combining affinity purification, proximity labeling and crosslinking mass spectrometry. Integration of these analyses not only offers a unique view on the composition, stoichiometry and structure of the core heterotrimeric SnRK1 complex but also reveals a myriad of novel robust SnRK1 interactors.

### Sample Protocol
All proximity labeling experiments were performed as described recently for cell cultures by Arora, D. et al., 2020, using denaturing extraction buffer (100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2% (w/v) SDS, 8 M urea) and sampling both unbiotinylated (E1) as well as biotinylated eluates (E2).

### Data Protocol
Affinity purification experiments were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously previously reported in Arora, D. et al., 2020. For removal of non-specific PL proteins, a dual filtering was applied. First, a similar NSAF-based strategy was applied as for the AP-MS filtering, now comparing with a control dataset of 210 PL experiments with 31 baits unrelated to SnRK1 signaling. Thereto, an enrichment factor was calculated as the product of the mean NSAF ratio and  Log10(p-value). Proteins identified in at least two replicates, with an enrichment factor ≥ 20 were retained. In addition, a second filtering was implemented to further remove non-specific PL proteins. Thereto, specific proteins were determined through a MaxQuant Label Free Quantification analysis comparing with representative control PL experiments obtained from sucrose-starved cell cultures. LFQ intensities were analyzed in Perseus to determine the significantly enriched proteins with the SnRK1 baits versus a small set of appropriate control experiments. Different thresholds (S0, FDR) were used in the volcano plot analysis to retrieve the top enriched protein set for the individual PL experiments, as indicated in Supplementary Table 3. For robust identification of specific interactors, only proteins that passed both filtering methods (NSAF large dataset AND MaxQuant LFQ) were retained.
