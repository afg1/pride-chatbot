### Title
Minimal expression of dysferlin prevents development of muscular dystrophy in dysferlin exon 40a knockout mice

### Description
Dysferlin is an essential muscle membrane repair protein and autosomal recessive mutations in its gene result in progressive muscular dystrophies collectively called dysferlinopathies. We previously showed that calpain-mediated cleavage within dysferlin exon 40a releases a 72kDa C-terminal minidysferlin recruited to injured sarcolemma. In the current study, we hypothesised that knocking out exon 40a will lead to defective membrane repair and development of muscular dystrophy over time. To address this hypothesis, we created three exon 40a knockout (40aKO) mouse lines with dysferlin protein levels ranging from ~80% of wildtype (WT) in 40aKO-3, ~50% in 40aKO-2 and ~10-20% in 40aKO-1 mice. Histopathological analysis of skeletal muscles harvested from all 12-month-old 40aKO mice showed little evidence of dystrophic features seen in dysferlin-null BLAJ mice. Lipidomics analysis on 18wk old quadriceps showed that all 40aKO lines had a similar lipidomic profile to WT and distinct from BLAJs. The proteomic profile of 40aKO lines was intermediate between that of WT and BLAJs. Laser membrane damage assays showed normal membrane repair capacity in all three 40aKO lines. These results collectively indicate that ~10-20% of dysferlin protein expression is sufficient for maintenance of the lipidome and membrane repair capacity, and crucially prevents development of muscular dystrophy.

### Sample Protocol
Proteomic analysis was conducted on the contralateral quadriceps muscles of 18wk old 40aKO lines, WT and BLAJ mice used for lipidomics analysis. Muscles were frozen in 2-methylbutane after harvest. To prepare samples for proteomic analysis, 10 muscle sections (10mm2, 8µm thick) per animal were homogenised on ice in 200µL of 2%SDS/50mM TEAB lysis buffer (pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors. After adding lysis buffer, samples were vortexed and then sonicated three times, cooling the samples on ice after each round of sonication. Samples were then frozen on dry ice and sent to the Proteomics facility at The Children’s Medical Research Institute (CMRI). LC-MS/MS analysis of muscle tissue lysates was performed on Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano system and Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1) WT is represented by TMT126, TMT127N, TMT127C, and TMT128N, 2) KO-2 is represented by TMT128C, TMT129N, TMT129C, and TMT130N, 3) KO-3 is represented by TMT130C, TMT131N, TMT131C, and TMT132N, 4) BLAJ is prepresented by TMT132C, TMT133N, TMT133C, and TMT134N

### Data Protocol
Raw data files from the Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instrument were then processed and peak lists generated using MaxQuant version 1.6.7.0. Database searching of the resulting peak lists was performed using the Andromeda search engine built into MaxQuant against the mouse UniProt Reference Proteome database (containing all UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot+TrEMBL mouse proteins including isoforms) (downloaded 03 June 2022, containing 63,628 entries). The database search was performed with trypsin/P digestion, allowing a maximum of three missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M), acetylation (protein N-terminal), and, deamidation (N and Q) were variable modifications. A maximum of three modifications per peptide was allowed, and the maximum peptide mass was 6,000 Da. The minimum peptide length was eight amino acids, the maximum peptide length was 25 amino axid. The default protein contaminants were included in the search. The MS/MS tolerance was 20 ppm. Peptide-spectrum match (PSM), protein, and the modification site false-discovery rate were set to 1%. The minimum score for modified peptides was 40. The “match between runs” options were disabled, and second peptide and dependent peptide searching was enabled and disabled, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
Dysferlin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated lipid binding protein implicated in muscle membrane repair. Recessive variants in DYSF result in dysferlinopathy, a progressive muscular dystrophy. We showed previously that calpain cleavage within a motif encoded by alternatively spliced exon 40a releases a 72&#xa0;kDa C-terminal minidysferlin recruited to injured sarcolemma. Herein we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out murine Dysf exon 40a, to specifically assess its role in membrane repair and development of dysferlinopathy. We created three Dysf exon 40a knockout (40aKO) mouse lines that each express different levels of dysferlin protein ranging from&#x2009;~&#x2009;90%,&#x2009;~&#x2009;50% and&#x2009;~&#x2009;10-20% levels of wild-type. Histopathological analysis of skeletal muscles from all 12-month-old 40aKO lines showed virtual absence of dystrophic features and normal membrane repair capacity for all three 40aKO lines, as compared with dysferlin-null BLAJ mice. Further, lipidomic and proteomic analyses on 18wk old quadriceps show all three 40aKO lines are spared the profound lipidomic/proteomic imbalance that characterises dysferlin-deficient BLAJ muscles. Collective results indicate that membrane repair does not depend upon calpain cleavage within exon 40a and that&#x2009;~&#x2009;10-20% of WT dysferlin protein expression is sufficient to maintain the muscle lipidome, proteome and membrane repair capacity to crucially prevent development of dysferlinopathy.
