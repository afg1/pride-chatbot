### Title
Euplotes crassus global proteome

### Description
The deposisted data is the deep dive global shotgun bottom-up LC-MS/MS proteome analysis of the Euplotes crassus microorganism.  The main objective of the project was to find confirmation of the frameshifts at the protein level.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested using a common 8M urea/DTT/aklylation protocol. Two alternative proteases were used: trypsin and Glu-C. Fractionation was performed using strong cation exchange (SCX) and high pH reverse phase chromatography (HPRP) for tryptic digest and HPRP only for Glu-C digest.

### Data Protocol
Datasets were searched against custom Euplotes crassus FASTA files (that included frameshifted sequences) using MSGF+.
