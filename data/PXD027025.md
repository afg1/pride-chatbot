### Title
CD9-HPLC-IAC Isolation of Serum Extracellular Vesicles for Proteomic Analysis

### Description
We developed a column-based CD9 antibody-immobilized HPLC immunoaffinity (CD9-HPLC-IAC) technology for EV isolation from a microliter-scale of serum for downstream proteomic analysis. The CD9-HPLC-IAC method achieved EV isolation from 40 μL of serum in 30 min with a yield of 8.0×109 EVs. Proteomic analysis showed that the common exosomal markers such as CD63, CD81, CD82, Alix, and TSG101 were all identified in EVs. Statistical analysis of EV protein content showed that the top 10 serum proteins in EVs was significantly decreased by using the CD9-HPLC-IAC method compared to the ultracentrifugation (UC) (p=0.001) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (p=0.009), and apolipoproteins significantly reduced 4.8-fold compared to the SEC method (p<0.001). The result demonstrated the potential of the CD9-HPLC-IAC method for efficient isolation and proteomic characterization of EVs from a micro-scale volume of serum.

### Sample Protocol
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from 40 μL of serum using an in-house anti-CD9 HPLC column on a Beckman Coulter HPLC system. The eluted EV fraction was collected and followed with a post-column cleaning procedure using a 50 kD centrifugal filter. EVs were subject to protein extraction and tryptic digestion prior to LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo) coupled with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system. Peptides were separated with 0.1% FA in water (A) and 80% CH3CN containing 0.1% FA (B) on a 75 μm × 50 cm column (Thermo, P/N 164942) under a 90 min linear gradient from 2 to 40% B at a flow rate 300 nL/min. The MS instrument was operated in positive ion mode and the data were acquired in a data-dependent mode. MS1 spectra (m/z 375−1700) were acquired in the Orbitrap (120 k resolution, 2e5 AGC target). Up to 20 of the most intense MS1 peaks were selected for tandem MS2 analysis by CID in the linear ion trap. The normalized collision energy was set at 34% for MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
All MS/MS spectra were searched against the human UniProt database using SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer 1.4, Thermo Scientific). The search parameters were as follows: static modification, carbamidomethyl (C); dynamic modifications, oxidation (M); 2 missed cleavages allowed; MS1 mass tolerance 10 ppm; MS2 mass tolerance 0.6 Da; 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Proteins were quantified using a label-free quantitative method.

### Publication Abstract
Serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a promising source of biomarkers; however, major challenges in EV separation and proteomic profiling remain for isolating EVs from a small amount, that is, on the microliter scale, of human serum while minimizing the contamination of blood proteins and lipoprotein particles coeluting in EV preparations. Herein we have developed a column-based CD9-antibody-immobilized high-performance liquid chromatography immunoaffinity chromatography(CD9-HPLC-IAC) technology for EV isolation from a microliter scale of serum for downstream proteomic analysis. The CD9-HPLC-IAC method achieved EV isolation from 40 &#x3bc;L of serum in 30 min with a yield of 8.0 &#xd7; 10<sup>9</sup> EVs, where EVs were further processed with a postcolumn cleaning step using the 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off filter for the buffer exchange, concentration, and reduction of potentially coeluting serum proteins. In total, 482 proteins were identified in EVs by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, including the common exosomal markers such as CD63, CD81, CD82, Alix, and TSG101. The statistical analysis of EV protein content showed that the top 10 serum proteins in EVs were significantly decreased by using the CD9-HPLC-IAC method compared with the use of ultracentrifugation (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and size exclusion chromatography (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and apolipoproteins were significantly reduced 4.8-fold compared with the SEC method (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The result demonstrates the potential of the CD9-HPLC-IAC method for the efficient isolation and proteomic characterization of EVs from a microscale volume of serum.
