### Title
Influenza virus infection leads to global cardiac proteome remodeling during convalescence

### Description
Influenza virus infection leads to global cardiac proteome remodeling during convalescence MTD project_description "Influenza virus infections lead to more than 500,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. every year. Patients with cardiovascular diseases have been shown to be at high risk of influenza mediated cardiac complications. Importantly, recent reports have provided clinical data supporting a direct link between laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection and adverse cardiac events. However, the molecular mechanisms of how influenza virus infection induces detrimental cardiac changes, even after resolution of the pulmonary infection, is completely unknown. We performed global quantitative proteomics as well as phosphoproteomics in this study.

### Sample Protocol
Heart tissues were first homogenize and then lysed using SDS buffer; proteins were digested using Suspension Trapping (STrap) method with the self-assembled filters. Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2; LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using Ultimate 3000 nanoLC and Q Exactive mass spec (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Label-free quantitation by MaxQuant (v1.6); downstream bioinformatics analyses were performed on Perseus software (v1.6).
