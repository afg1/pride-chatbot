### Title
Ulcerative_Colitis_Human_Gut_Microbiome

### Description
Exploration of human distal gut microbiome proteins from ulcerative colitis and healthy volunteers

### Sample Protocol
Unenriched: Microbes extracted from human fecal samples by differential centrifugation, lyophilized, triflic acid treated, dialyzed, reduced, alkylated, and trypsinized.   FP-probe enriched: microbes extracted from human fecal samples, treated with FP-probe, denatured, enriched with streptavidin beads, beads washed, beads reduced, beads alkylated, beads trypsinized, peptides separated from beads.  Peptides were C18 desalted, separated by 4h 1-dimensional C18 gradient, analyzed using Thermo Orbitrap Fusion tribrid operated in data dependent mode by an Orbitrap-Orbitrap MS1-MS2 detection strategy.

### Data Protocol
DDA data were searched using the ProLuCID/SEQUEST algorithm against a comprehensive metaproteomics database (ComPIL 2). MS1 quantification was performed using FlashLFQ.
