### Title
Murine hippocampal phosphoproteome LC-MSMS

### Description
The hippocampus plays an important role in spatial memory and the conversion of short-term to long-term memory. Several studies have reported the presence of a peripheral oscillator in the hippocampus, and have highlighted the importance of circadian regulation in memory formation. In this study we performed global quantitative phosphoproteome analyses of the murine hippocampus across the circadian cycle, applying spiked-in labeled reference and high accuracy mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Thirty male C57BL6/J mice, aged 8 to 12 weeks, were stably entrained for a minimum of 2 weeks to a 12 h light: 12 h dark (LD) schedule (light intensity during the light phase was 200 lux) prior to transfer to complete darkness (DD) for 2 full cycles. Dark adaptation was achieved by placing cages into light-tight ventilated cabinets. On day 3 of DD, 5 mice were sacrificed at each time point corresponding to circadian time (CT) 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22, where CT was defined by the Zeitgeber time (ZT) of the previous LD schedule. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and decapitated under dim red light, and eyes were covered with black electrical tape. Subsequently, whole hippocampal tissues were dissected, immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 鈭�80oC until further processing. Hippocampal tissues were homogenized in 300 渭L of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM DTT, 4% (v/v) SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate supplemented with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mississauga, ON, CAN) and phosphoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) with a pellet pestle, and sonicated 3 times with 10 s pulses each with >30 s on ice between each pulse. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Hippocampal lysates (1 mg) and super SILAC-labeled cell lysates (0.2 mg from each of Neuro-2a, AtT-20, mHypoE-N38, CLU-181 and CLU-188 cells) were mixed at a 1:1 weight ratio, and SDS in solution was removed by an overnight incubation at -20oC in five volumes of ice-cold precipitation buffer (acetone/ethanol/acetic acid (v/v/v) = 50/50/0.1). The precipitated proteins were washed twice with ice-cold acetone, and the protein pellets were redissolved in 50 mM NH4HCO3 solution containing 8M urea. For in-solution trypsin digestion, 1.3 mg of proteins in each sample was reduced with 5 mM DTT (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at 60oC for 1 h and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) in the dark (40 min at room temperature). Each sample was diluted in five-fold volume of 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) solution to reduce the urea concentration to <2 M and digested overnight with TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:25 (w/w). For proteomic analysis, 0.1 mg of resulting peptides were fractionated through an in-house constructed strong cation exchange (SCX) column with five pH fractions (pH 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0) followed by desalting with in-house C18 desalting cartridges and dried in a speed-vac prior to LC-MS analysis. The remaining 1.2 mg of tryptic peptides were desalted by SepPak C18 cartridges (Waters, Mississauga, ON, CAN), dried, and SCX fractionated into 4 fractions (pH 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0) prior to phosphoproteome enrichment. Ti4+-IMAC beads preparation and the phosphopeptide enrichment procedure. Samples were resuspended in 1 mL loading buffer (80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) and 6% (v/v) TFA) with 300 渭L of Ti4+-IMAC bead slurry (10 mg beads in 1 mL of loading buffer) for 30 min at 4oC. After centrifugation (16000 xg, 10 min), beads were washed with 200 渭L of washing buffer 1 (50% (v/v) ACN, 6% (v/v) TFA and 200 mM NaCl), followed by two washes with 200 渭L of washing buffer 2 (30% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% (v/v) TFA). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads using 200 渭L of 10% (v/v) ammonia solution for 15 min and sonicated for another 15 min at 4oC. After centrifugation, the retrieved supernatants were collected, acidified with 10% (v/v) TFA, desalted with in-house C18 desalting cartridges and dried in a speed-vac prior to LC-MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
MS data from the hippocampal proteome and phosphoproteome were analyzed and quantified with MaxQuant (version 1.3.0.5) using Andromeda as the search engine against the UniProt (release 2014_04) database restricted to Mouse (Mus musculus) taxonomy concatenated with decoy reversed sequences. The precursor ion mass tolerance was 6 ppm and fragment mass deviation was 0.5 Da for MS/MS spectra. The search included variable modifications of methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation and fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation. Trypsin/P (cleavage after Lysine and Arginine, including Lysine-Proline and Arginine-Proline) was set as the cleavage specificity with two missed cleavages. The false discovery rate (FDR) cut-offs for peptide and protein identification were both set to 0.01 and the minimum peptide length was set to 7. Identification across different replicates and adjacent fractions were achieved by enabling match between runs option within a time window of 2 min. Default settings were used for all the other parameters in MaxQuant. The Phospho (STY) Sites file from the phosphoproteome were imported into Perseus (version 1.5.2.4) for the analysis.

### Publication Abstract
The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator that drives daily rhythms in physiology, behavior, and gene expression. The underlying mechanisms of circadian timekeeping are cell-autonomous and involve oscillatory expression of core clock genes that is driven by interconnecting transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs). Circadian clock TTFLs are further regulated by posttranslational modifications, in particular, phosphorylation. The hippocampus plays an important role in spatial memory and the conversion of short- to long-term memory. Several studies have reported the presence of a peripheral oscillator in the hippocampus and have highlighted the importance of circadian regulation in memory formation. Given the general importance of phosphorylation in circadian clock regulation, we performed global quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome analyses of the murine hippocampus across the circadian cycle, applying spiked-in labeled reference and high accuracy mass spectrometry (MS). Of the 3,052 proteins and 2,868 phosphosites on 1,368 proteins that were accurately quantified, 1.7% of proteins and 5.2% of phosphorylation events exhibited time-of-day-dependent expression profiles. The majority of circadian phosphopeptides displayed abrupt fluctuations at mid-to-late day without underlying rhythms of protein abundance. Bioinformatic analysis of cyclic phosphorylation events revealed their diverse distribution in different biological pathways, most notably, cytoskeletal organization and neuronal morphogenesis. This study provides the first large-scale, quantitative MS analysis of the circadian phosphoproteome and proteome of the murine hippocampus and highlights the significance of rhythmic regulation at the posttranslational level in this peripheral oscillator. In addition to providing molecular insights into the hippocampal circadian clock, our results will assist in the understanding of genetic factors that underlie rhythms-associated pathological states of the hippocampus.
