### Title
Mouse gut metaproteome -  MetaPro-IQ: a universal metaproteomic approach to studying human and mouse gut microbiota

### Description
The mouse stool samples were collected from different diets fed mice and bacterial cells were harvest for metaproteomic analysis for understanding the role ofdiet on gut microbiota.

### Sample Protocol
Mouse stools were processed with differential centrifugation to harvest bacterial cells. The bacterial cells were lysed with 4%SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data were search against gut microbiome database with a final quantification with MaxQuant.
