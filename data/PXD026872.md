### Title
A YAP/TAZ-TEAD signaling module links endothelial nutrient acquisition to  angiogenic growth

### Description
Angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) form new blood vessels from existing ones, is intimately linked to the tissue's metabolic milieu and often occurs at nutrient-deficient sites. However, ECs rely on sufficient metabolic resources to support growth and proliferation. How endothelial nutrient acquisition and usage are regulated is unknown. Here we show that these processes are dictated by YAP/TAZ-TEAD – a transcriptional module whose function is highly responsive to changes in the tissue environment. ECs lacking YAP/TAZ or their transcriptional partners, TEAD1, 2, and 4 fail to divide, resulting in stunted vascular growth in mice. Conversely, activation of TAZ, the more abundant paralogue in ECs, boosts proliferation, leading to vascular hyperplasia. We find that YAP/TAZ promote angiogenesis by fueling nutrient mTORC1 signaling. By orchestrating the transcription of a repertoire of cell-surface transporters, YAP/TAZ-TEAD stimulate the import of amino acids and other essential nutrients, thereby enabling mTORC1 pathway activation. Dissociating mTORC1 from these nutrient inputs – elicited by the loss of Rag GTPases – inhibits mTORC1 activity and prevents YAP/TAZ-dependent vascular growth. These findings define a pivotal role for YAP/TAZ-TEAD in steering endothelial mTORC1 and illustrate the essentiality of coordinated nutrient fluxes in the vasculature.

### Sample Protocol
HUVECs were infected with AdCtrl, AdYAPS127A and AdTAZS89A and immunoprecipitations (IPs) performed with FLAG M2 beads 16 h after transduction. Eluates were separated by SDS–PAGE (NuPAGE 4–12 % BisTris gel, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Protein Staining Solution (Invitrogen). Gel pieces were excised for in-gel digestion using trypsin after reduction and alkylation. After washes with 50 % (50 mM NH4HCO3 / 50 % ethanol) for 20 min, gel piece were dehydrated with 100 % ethanol for 10 min and vacuum dried. Thereafter, samples were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 55 mM iodocetamide (BioUltra, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After two steps of washing/dehydration, gel pieces were dehydrated twice with 100% ethanol for 15 min, vacuum dried, and then digested overnight at 37 °C in 50 μl of digestion buffer containing 12.5 ng μl of Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega Corp., Madison, USA). Released peptides were extracted once by adding 100 μl of 30% acetonitrile liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) grade (Thermo Scientific)/3% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in water, and twice by adding 70% acetonitrile, followed by two final extractions with 100% acetonitrile. Extractswere vacuum dried to remove acetonitrile and subsequently acidified with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Peptides were purified by stop and go extraction tips, analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using a EASY-nLC chromatograph in line toa QExactive mass spectrometer (TheromFisher Scientific, both). Relevant instrument parameters have been extracted ans summarized using MARMoSET and are included in the supplental material along with the MaxQuant parameters used.

### Data Protocol
Peptide/spectrum matching as well as label free qua titaiton were performed by the MaxQuant suite of algorithms (v.1.5.2.8) against the human UniProt database and data postprocessing using Perseus. Relevant instrument parameters have been extracted ans summarized using MARMoSET and are included in the supplental material along with the MaxQuant parameters used.
