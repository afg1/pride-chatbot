### Title
Exploring the interactome of human METTL9

### Description
Exploring the interactome of the human putative methyltransferase enzyme METTL9.

### Sample Protocol
Protein constructs corresponding to GFP-METTL9 and GFP alone were individually over-expressed in in HEK-293 cells and affinity purified using GFP-Trap beads. Proteins were eluted through on-bead proteolysis using trypsin, the resulting peptides desalted using StageTips and analyzed by nLC-MS/MS using EASY-nLC 1200 coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were quantified using the MaxLFQ algorithm and all analysis of proteomics data was performed using Perseus (v1.6.5.0). For Volcano plot analysis, LFQ intensity was required in two out of three replicates and missing values were imputed from the lower part of the abundance distribution using the default setting in Perseus.
