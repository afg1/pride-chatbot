### Title
Comparative O-glycoproteomics of Fusarium oxysporum

### Description
Fusarium oxysporum causes Fusarium wilt syndrome in more than 120 different plant hosts, including globally important crops such as tomato, cotton, banana, melon, etc. F. oxysporum shows high host specificity in over 150 formae speciales and have been ranked in the top 10 plant fungal pathogens. Although three PMTs encoded by the pmt1, pmt2, and pmt4 are annotated in the genome of F. oxysporum, their functions have not been reported. As O-mannosylation is not found in plants, a comprehensive understanding of PMTs in F. oxysporum becomes attractive for the development of new strategy against Fusarium wilt. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of the differential functions of three PMTs, a comparative O-glycoproteome analysis of the pmt mutants were carried out.

### Sample Protocol
Total protein was firstly reduced in 5 mM DTT at 60℃ for 1h, and then alkylated in 10 mM iodoacetamide with dark at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction solution was applied to centrifuge filter unit (Amicon Ultra-0.5ml). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature, and subsequently washed with 200 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 for three times. After that, the samples were digested with trypsin or GluC with enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50, the reaction was incubated at 37℃ for 12 h. To inactivate the protease, the reaction solution was heated at 95°C for 20 min. Then, the samples were digested with 4 μl of PNGase F overnight at 37℃, an additional 2 μl of PNGase F was added and incubated continually for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was acidified with 0.1% TFA and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The peptides were purified by C18 SPE column and evaporated to dry, then was dissolved in Con A binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2/MgCl2/MnCl2). The samples were applied to HiTrap ConA 4B column (GE Healthcare, 0.5 ml) in ÄKTApurifier with flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, the injected sample was held in column for 10 min followed by 5 column volumes (CVs) washing in Con A binding buffer, the enriched glycopeptides were eluted out by Con A elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 M Methyl α-D-Mannopyranoside/Methyl α-D-glucopyranoside) with flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. 6 CVs of eluates were collected and purified by Sep-Pak C18 column. After evaporated to dry, the glycopeptides were further fractionated by high-pH reversed phase HPLC. The sample was separated into 24 fractions using a C18 column of 4.6X250 mm, 5 μm particle (Agilent) at flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 60-min gradient of 5-45% ACN with aqueous ammonia added, the fractions were then combined into 12 fractions. The samples were evaporated and resuspended in a solvent of 0.1% FA (v/v) and subjected to an EASY-nLC 1000 interfaced via a Flex ion source to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were loaded onto a trap column (C18, 5 m particles, 100 m ID, 3 mm length, Dr. Maisch GmbH) and separated using an analytical column (C18, 3 m particles, 75 m ID, 15 mm length, Dr. Maisch GmbH) at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with a 60 min LC gradient composed of Solvent A (0.1% FA (V/V)) and Solvent B (ACN,0.1% FA (V/V)). The gradient was 3-8% B for 5 min, 8-20% B for 40min, 20-35% B for 10 min, 35-80% B for 3 min, and finally 80% B for 2 min. A data-dependent Top 20 method was used with precursor MS1 scan (m/z 350–1550) acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution setting of 120,000, followed by Orbitrap HCD-MS/MS and EThcD-MS/MS of the 20 most abundant multiply charged precursors in the MS1 spectrum, MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was carried out using Byonic software (Protein metrics, V3.2-38) with searching against the F. oxysporum protein database. The analysis parameter was set up as following: HCD or EThcD was chosen as the fragmentation type, the precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance to 0.05 Da. Carbamidomethylation on Cys was used as a fixed modification, oxidation of Met, deamidation of Asn and O-glycans of Hex1-5 on Ser and Thr were taken as variable modifications. A maximum of two missed cleavage sites were tolerated for fully specific digestion of trypsin and GluC. Protein FDR was set as 1%. The glycopeptides carrying O-glycans of Hex1-5 with Score>300 and Log Prob>3 were considered as credible results.

### Publication Abstract
Protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) have been identified in fungi but not in plants and nematodes, which makes PMTs become attractive targets for developing a new strategy against phytopathogens. Three PMTs have been identified in Fusarium oxysporum, a fungal pathogen that causes vascular wilt in a broad range of economical crops. By deletion or suppression of the pmt genes, we showed that all mutants displayed retarded growth, reduced conidiation, cell wall defects, ER stress and attenuated virulence in F. oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum. In addition, the &#x394;pmt1 exhibited reduced thermotolerance, while the &#x394;pmt4 and the pmt2 conditional mutant exhibited abnormal polarized growth. Comparative glycoproteome analysis of these pmt mutants revealed that PMTs preferentially modified random coils with flanking regions rich in Ser, Thr, Ala, Glu, Asp and Lys at the stem region of membrane proteins, the N-terminal region close to signal peptide of secreted proteins, or surface of soluble proteins. PMT1 specifically acted on nuclear proteins and proteins that are responsible for protein folding, which might contribute to thermotolerance. PMT4 specifically acted on the membrane and soluble proteins in secretory pathways, especially the GPI anchoring pathway, which might contribute to synthesis and transportation of GPI anchored proteins and thus polarized growth. PMT2 was responsible for modification of proteins that are required for protein folding and cell wall synthesis, which might make PMT2 essential. Our results gave an insight to understanding of the roles of each O-mannosyltransferase in F. oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum and provide a new perspective to prevent Fusarium wilt.
