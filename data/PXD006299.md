### Title
Characterisation of protein ubiquitination using UbiSite technology

### Description
We present a novel immune-affinity-based method UbiSite for capture and further identification of ubiquitination sites by MS for any cell line or tissue sample. Implementing the UbiSite methodology for a large-scale experiment we successfully mapped 62000 unique ubiquitination sites on protein substrates for two different human cell lines.

### Sample Protocol
Cultured cells (40 - 50 mg of total protein for one large-scale experiment) were harvested, washed two times with PBS and lysed in 10 ml lysis buffer (8 M Guanidine-HCl, 25 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate pH 8.0), sonicated and centrifuged at 15000 RCF for 30 min. Proteins were reduced with DTT at room temperature (2 mM for 30 min) and alkylated with CAA at RT (Chloroacetamide 11mM 30 min). Samples were diluted to 2M Guanidine-HCl with 25 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate pH8.5 and the lysates were filtrated through 0.45 Ã‚Âµm PVDF filters (Millipore). Endopeptidase LysC were added for digestion in a 1:100 protein ratio for incubation overnight at room temperature. The peptides mixture was purified using C18 cartridges (WATERS) in accord with manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions and lyophilized for 24 - 36 hours. The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 20-25 ml of IAP buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Triton X-100. The dissolved peptides were spun down and filtrated through the a 0.45Ã‚Âµm low protein binding filter. About 400 Ã‚Âµl of UbiSite conjugated matrix was used for immunoprecipitation for 5 hours at 4Ã‚Â°C. After IP UbiSite beads were washed 3 times with IAP buffer without detergent and 3 times with wash solution (150 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitated peptides were eluted from beads by incubation with 0.1% TFA (3 times for 5 minutes incubation). Pooled elutions LysC-digested peptides were either neutralized with 1 M Ammonium Bicarbonate solution to 25 mM and subjected to trypsin digestion overnight at 37Ã‚Â°C or used directly for fractionation and LC-MS/MS analysis. The tryptic peptide mixture was subjected to a stepwise high pH fractionation(HpH). Samples of LysC-digested peptides were fractionated with increasing concentration of acetonitrile into 4 fractions. Proteome analysis peptides were fractionated by offline high pH (HpH) reversed-phase chromatography

### Data Protocol
MS raw files were analyzed using the MaxQuant software version 1.5.5.31 with the integrated Andromeda search engine. Data were searched against a target/decoy (forward and reversed) version of the reviewed part of the human Uniprot database  (Swiss-Prot) supplemented with commonly observed contaminants. The analysis was carried out with the match-between-run feature enabled and using the label-free quantitation (LFQ) algorithm for proteome expression analysis. For each experiment/file the enzyme used for digestion was specified to either Trypsin or LysC. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed modification. Protein N-terminal acetylation and pyroglutamate formation from glutamine were searched as variable modifications for all files. Furthermore, ubiquitylation of lysines and N-termini was searched as variable modifications for all experiments; for trypsin digested peptides this was done in the form of GG-remnants on lysine as well as N-termini, whereas for LysC-digested peptides ubiquitylation was searched as ESTLHLVLRLRGG-remnants on lysine and N-termini. The following extra variable modifications were also considered: deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. In addition, conjugation of ISG15 (ISGylation) and Nedd8 to lysine residues were searched as additional modifications  to LysC-digested peptides. Maximum number of missed cleavages was set to 3 and 2 for trypsin and LysC-digested peptides, respectively. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was used for peptide, protein and site identifications.
