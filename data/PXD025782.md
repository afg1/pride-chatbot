### Title
The RNA-binding proteins SRP14 and HMGB3 control HIV-1 Tat mRNA processing and translation during HIV-1 latency

### Description
HIV-1 Tat protein is essential for virus production. RNA-binding proteins that facilitate Tat production may be absent or downregulated in resting CD4+ T-cells, the main reservoir of latent HIV. In this study, we examined the role of Tat RNA-binding proteins on the expression of Tat and control of latent and productive infection.

### Sample Protocol
TCEP (10 mM, ThermoScientific) was added to the protein complexes to reduce the cysteine bonds in proteins, and heated for 20 min at 60°C followed by alkylation of cysteines using 25 mM Iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at RT in the dark. Samples were subjected to proteolytic cleavage by addition of 1 μg of trypsin protease from porcine pancreas per 100 μg of protein and incubated overnight at 37 °C under agitation. Reactions were stopped by addition of formic acid and the resultant peptides were concentrated using C18-packed tips (BondElut, Agilent/Varian).

### Data Protocol
To identify protein groups, data acquired was converted into mgf andsearched against Swissprot human database (version 2016_12) using ProteinPilot software (v4.0, SCIEX) with the following search parameters: Iodoacetamide alkylation, trypsin enzyme digestion, instrument-specific settings for TripleTOF 5600+ (MS tolerance 0.05 Da, MS/MS tolerance 0.1 Da, charge state +2 to +5), biological modification probabilistic features on, thorough ID algorithm, and detected protein threshold 0.05.
