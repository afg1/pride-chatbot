### Title
Human UFSP1 is an active UFM1-specific protease

### Description
In order to confirm the translation initiation site of human UFSP1 (UFM1-specific protease 1), we sought to obtain direct evidence using mass spectrometry (MS) for peptide sequencing.

### Sample Protocol
The MS analysis was performed by Micrometer Biotech Company (Hangzhou, China). For in-gel tryptic digestion, gel pieces were destained and dehydrated. Protein reduction was performed for 60 min at 56 °C with 10 mM DTT. Protein alkylation was performed in the dark for 45 min at room temperature with 50 mM iodoacetamide. After washing and dehydrating, gel pieces were digested with 10 μg/mL trypsin at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted from the gel matrix and dried to completion. For LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (15-cm length, 75 μm i.d.). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 8% to 35% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) over 60 min, 35% to 80% in 5 min and then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion coupled online to the UPLC. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The m/z scan range was 350 to 1800 for full scan, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000. Peptides were then selected for MS/MS using NCE setting as 28 and the fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans with 15.0s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4.

### Data Protocol
For data processing, the resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant. Tandem mass spectra were searched against Uniprot-Human. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme. Mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification, oxidation on Met, Deamidation (NQ) ,K(GG) ,K(GV) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) were specified as variable modifications.
