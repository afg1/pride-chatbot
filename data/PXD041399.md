### Title
Ultrasensitive proteomics depicted an in-depth landscape for the very early stage of mouse maternal-to-zygotic transition

### Description
Maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a conserved and fundamental process during which the maternal environment of oocyte transits to the zygotic genome driven expression program, and terminally differentiated oocyte and sperm are reprogrammed to totipotency. Metaphase II (MII) oocytes and zygotes (one-cell embryo) serve as the mature oocyte and the initiation of pre-implantation embryo development respectively, and characterizing their molecular landscapes at protein levels plays an important role in uncovering MZT and zygotic genome activation (ZGA )in mammals. Here we used an ultrasensitive proteomic approach to depict an in-depth landscape for the very early stage of mouse MZT.

### Sample Protocol
For label-free samples, clean oocytes or zygotes were lysed, then TCEP and CAA were added for reduction and alkylation, respectively. After incubation for 5 min at 95 °C, proteins were incubated with pre-washed magnetic beads, then the protein-binding beads were washed and trypsinized. Clean peptides by C18 homemade StageTips were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) formate/ddH2O for LC-MS/MS analysis. For TMT-labelled samples, single zygotes were dispensed into 384-well plates. The plates were frozen and heated to lysis cells and release proteins. MS-grade trypsin were added and the 384-well plates were incubated at 37 °C to digest proteins. Peptides were then labelled with TMTsixplex™ reagents or TMTpro™ 16plex reagent, and quenched by 0.2% (v/v) TFA. Differentially labelled samples from one TMT set were combined and desalted in homemade C18 StageTips. Clean peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) formate/ddH2O for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
MS raw files of TMT-label experiments and DDA label-free experiments were processed with SpectroMine™ (v3.2; Biognosys) and searched against the UniProt/SwissProt mouse database (UP000000589, containing 17,090 entries, downloaded on Nov 24, 2021) using Pulsar engine with default settings. MS raw files of DIA label-free experiments was processed with Spectronaut® (v16; Biognosys) with default settings. A hybrid spectral library of mouse oocyte and preimplantation embryo proteome were established and raw files were searched against this self-established hybrid spectral library with default params unless otherwise stated.
