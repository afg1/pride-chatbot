### Title
The effect of corticosterone treatment on the proteome of mouse brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells

### Description
Elevated glucocorticoids feature body’s responses to a variety of psychological and physiological stressors. To understand how glucocorticoids affect brain endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier, we applied quantitative proteomics to study changes in the proteome of a mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEnd3, upon acute 24-hour treatment with 5 uM corticosterone in vitro.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets (10^6 cells) were lysed in 400 uL of Lysis-buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM 2-Cloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0) at 95°C for 2 min and then sonicated for 10 times 30 sec at high intensity using a Bioruptor Plus sonication system (Diogenode). The incubation and sonication steps were repeated. Samples were diluted 1:4 in MS grade water (VWR) and digested for 4 hours at 37°C with 1 µg of LysC and overnight at 37 C with 3 µg trypsin (Promega). The solution of peptides was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Merck) to a final concentration of 1%, followed by purification via SCX StageTips (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with 1% TFA in isopropanol, followed by a second wash with 0.2% TFA, eluted as one fraction with 80% acetonitrile and 5% ammonia (Merck). Samples were vacuum dried and re-suspended in 6 µl of buffer A (0.1% Formic acid (Roth) in MS grade water (VWR)) prior to loading onto a column. Peptides were loaded onto a column (30 cm, inner diameter of 75 microns) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9-micron beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH) via the autosampler of the Thermo Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 60°C. Using the nanoelectrospray interface, eluting peptides were directly sprayed onto the benchtop Orbitrap mass spectrometer Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid) at 250 nl/min and percentage of buffer B (80% Acetonitril, 0.1% Formic acid) was ramped to 30% over 120 minutes, followed by a ramp to 60% over 10 minutes, then to 95% over the next 5 minutes and percentage of buffer B was maintained at 95% for another 5 minutes. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode with survey scans from 300 to 1750 m/z (resolution of 60000 at m/z =200), and up to 15 of the top precursors were selected and fragmented using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD with a normalized collision energy of value of 28). The MS2 spectra were recorded at a resolution of 15000 (at m/z = 200). AGC target for MS1 and MS2 scans were set to 3e6 and 1e5 respectively within a maximum injection time of 100 ms for MS1 and 25 ms for MS2 scans. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 ms.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed using the MaxQuant computational platform (Cox & Mann 2008 Nat Biotechnol; PMID: 19029910) with standard settings applied. The peak list was searched against the reviewed mouse proteome database (downloaded March 7, 2019) with an allowed precursor mass deviation of 4.5 ppm and an allowed fragment mass deviation of 20 ppm. MaxQuant by default enables individual peptide mass tolerances, which was used in the search. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as static modification, and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Downstream analyses and visualizations were performed in R environment (version 3.6.1). Data filtering, normalization, and differential expression were performed using the DEP package (version 1.8.0; Zhang et al. 2018 Nat Protocols, PMID: 29446774), in which LFQ intensities from the “proteinGroups” file were used as input.
