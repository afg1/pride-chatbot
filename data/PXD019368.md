### Description
Top-down proteomics has emerged as a powerful strategy to characterize proteins in biological systems. Nevertheless, the analysis of endogenous membrane proteins is challenging due to their low solubility, low abundance, and the complexity of the membrane subproteome. Here, we report a simple, effective enrichment and separation strategy for top-down proteomics of endogenous membrane proteins enabled by cloud-point enrichment and multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The cloud point extraction efficiently enriched membrane proteins using a single extraction, eliminating the need for time-consuming ultracentrifugation steps. Subsequently, size-exclusion chromatography with an MS-compatible mobile phase was used to fractionate intact proteins (6-115 kDa). Fractions were separated further by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with MS for protein characterization.  We applied this method to human embryonic kidney cells and cardiac tissue, enabling the identification of 188 and 124 endogenous integral membrane proteins respectively, some with as many as 19 transmembrane domains.

### Sample Protocol
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) 293T cell (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured on 10 cm plates (~90% confluent) using 10 % FBS and 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plates were harvested with PBS, pelleted using centrifugation at 500 × g, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Swine heart tissue was collected from UW-Madison meat science laboratory and was flash-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Donor's hearts were received after surgical human heart transplant specimens in the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. All procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board. Donor heart tissue was maintained in cardioplegic solution before dissection and the tissue was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C as described previously1,2. One plate of 10 cm cells were lysed in 0.8 buffer (25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.5 M NaF, 10 mM Methionine, 2 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF) using a 27 G needle (10x). 0.2 mL of Triton X-114 (Protein Grade) or Tergitol NP-7 was added and the solution gently was shaken at 4 °C. After briefly clearing the sample using centrifugation (15,000 × g) the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min resulting in a cloudy bottom layer and a clear top layer. The sample was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min and the top layer was discarded. Similarly, ~50 mg of cardiac tissue was homogenized with a Polytron electric homogenizer (model PRO200, Pro Scientific) in 0.8 mL of buffer. Triton X-114 was added and the cloud-point procedure performed. 0.8 mL of fresh buffer was added to the bottom layer and the cloud-point procedure performed again to further deplete soluble proteins. Finally, the samples were precipitated using the chloroform:methanol: water method3 to remove the high concentration of detergent. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μL cold formic acid (80%)4 supplemented with methionine (20 mM). The sample was briefly sonicated in a water bath to resolubilize the pellet and diluted with 50 μL of IPA and 25 μL of water. The protein concentrations (~2-3 μg/μL) were determined using BCA protein assay with BSA as a standard. Size-exclusion Chromatography of Membrane Protein Samples Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) separation was performed using a 200 mm x 4.6, 3 μm, 1000 Å Polyhydroxylethyl-A column on a Water’s (Milford, MA, USA) Aqcuity H-Class with a mobile phase of 40% IPA and 1% formic acid. A flow rate of 0.150 mL/min was used and the column was equilibrated with a least 3 blanks. 5 μg of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Ubiquitin from bovine erythrocytes were separated and used as standards to ensure reproducibility. Next, 50 μL (~150 μg) of the sample was injected and fractions were collected (8.5-11 min, 11-12 min, 12-13 min, and 13-15 min). Two collections were pooled and samples were concentrated using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff filters (Amicon). 1 volume of water was added and the fractions were concentrated to a final volume of ~60 μL. Alternatively, SEC separation was performed using a 200 mm x 9.4 mm, 3 μm, 1000 Å Polyhydroxylethyl-A column using a flow rate of 0.500 mL/min. 120 μL (~300 μg) of the sample was injected and fractions were collected every min (10-18 min). The fractions were concentrated and combined (Fraction 1-2, 3-4, 4-5, 4-6, 7-8). 16 μL of the sample (from the SEC separation using a 4.6 mm column) was dried via speed-vac and dissolved in 1x SDS loading buffer. The sample was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and separated at 150 V for ~ 80 min. The gel was stained with coomassie blue. The remaining sample was used for mass spectrometry analysis. For the SEC separation using the 9.4 mm column, the entire samples were dried via speed-vac, dissolved in 1x loading buffer, and separated as described above. Reverse-Phase Chromatography and Top-down Analysis 10 μL of each fraction was injected on a home-packed PLRP column (250 x 0.250 mm, 5 μm, 1000 Å) heated to 50 °C. The separation was performed with a mobile phase of water + 0.2% formic acid (A) and ACN: IPA + 0.2% formic acid (B) using a flow rate of 5 μL on a Water’s nanoAcquity (M-Class). The gradient was varied to optimize separation; however, the following provided good separation as demonstrated by Figure 3 and Figure S6: 0-5 min 20% B, 5-65 min 20-95% B, 65-70 min 95% B, 70-71 min 95%-20 %. Protein eluting from the column were infused into a maXis II ETD Q-TOF (Bruker Daltonics) via electrospray ionization with a capillary voltage of 4500 V and an endplate offset 500 V. MS1 scans were collected at 1 Hz and the top 3 most intense ions were selected for collision-induced dissociation (CID) at 2-4 Hz (intensity 2000-20000) scan rate, and a voltage energy scaled by the m/z and charge (see below). Ions were excluded after 4 scans.

### Data Protocol
Data Analysis. DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics) was used to analyze the raw MS spectra. For protein identification, a msalign file was created using the Sophisticated Numerical Annotation Procedure (SNAP) peak-picking algorithm with the following parameters: quality factor (0.4); signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) (3); intensity threshold (500); and a retention window (1.5 min) as described previously.19 A compiled list of precursor mass-to-charge, precursor charge, and precursor mass followed by the fragment mass-to-charge, intensities, and charges were used to perform protein spectral matching searching against the Homo sapiens reviewed Uniprot26 database (released on 2 July 2018) or the Sus scrofa Uniprot26 database (released on 22 November 2017) using TopPIC (1.1.2)27. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm, a satisfactory number of assigned fragment ions (>6) was required, and the false discovery rate was set to 1%. Sequence mass determination and validation and fragmentation mapping were performed using MASH Suite Pro28. The proteoform mass distribution was determined using the following approach similarly as described previously19,22: (1) LC-MS scans were averaged every minute; (2) deconvoluted using maximum entropy algorithm (resolution: 10,000; mass range: 5,000–150,000 Da); (3) mass list outputs were generated using Sum peak (S/N: 5 and absolute intensity >50,000). String analysis was performed using STRINGv11 online software using the highest confidence setting.29 A gene list was imported into Panther software (http://www.pantherdb.org/)30 for gene ontology analysis. The prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using TMHMM Server v. 2.0  (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/)31 and Uniprot26. Prediction of subcellular localization was done using iLoc-Animal32 (http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iLoc-Animal).

### Publication Abstract
Although top-down proteomics has emerged as a powerful strategy to characterize proteins in biological systems, the analysis of endogenous membrane proteins remains challenging due to their low solubility, low abundance, and the complexity of the membrane subproteome. Here, we report a simple but effective enrichment and separation strategy for top-down proteomics of endogenous membrane proteins enabled by cloud point extraction and multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The cloud point extraction efficiently enriched membrane proteins using a single extraction, eliminating the need for time-consuming ultracentrifugation steps. Subsequently, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with an MS-compatible mobile phase (59% water, 40% isopropanol, 1% formic acid) was used to remove the residual surfactant and fractionate intact proteins (6-115 kDa). The fractions were separated further by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled with MS for protein characterization. This method was applied to human embryonic kidney cells and cardiac tissue lysates to enable the identification of 188 and 124 endogenous integral membrane proteins, respectively, some with as many as 19 transmembrane domains.
