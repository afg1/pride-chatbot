### Title
Time-resolved adipocyte FGF21 phosphoproteome

### Description
To elucidate the signalling network responsible for mediating the effects of FGF21, we quantified the dynamic phosphoproteome of adipocytes following acute exposure to this hormone. A major FGF21-regulated signalling node was mTORC1/S6K. In contrast to insulin, we find that FGF21 activates mTORC1 via MAPK signalling rather than through the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway. This study provides a systems view of FGF21 signalling and reveals a new role for mTORC1 in maintaining nutrient homeostasis.

### Sample Protocol
SILAC-labelled 3T3-L1 adipocytes were digested with trypsin/LysC, peptides were fractionated by SCX, and phosphopeptides enriched by TiO2, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive or Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
RAW data were processed using MaxQuant version 1.5.3.25, searched against the mouse UniProt database (Jan 2016 release).
