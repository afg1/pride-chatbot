### Title
Recombinant Wine Haze Proteins rTLP and rCHI

### Description
Recombinant TLP (rTLP) and CHI (rCHI), expressed by Komagataella phaffii, were used as as haze-protein models, for having similar characteristics (aggregation potential, melting point, functionality, glycosylation levels and bentonite adsorption) to the native-haze proteins from Vitis vinifera.

### Sample Protocol
The samples were prepared by typical bottom up MS methods followed by trypsin digestion. The peptides were separated using a Kinetex C18 (2.1×100 mm, 2.6 µm, 100 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) column through an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)

### Data Protocol
The recorded raw files were searched against the UniProt database, taxonomically set to Vitis vinifera, using Proteome Discoverer software version 2.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

### Publication Abstract
Cross-linking net aggregates of thermolabile thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) and chitinases (CHIs) are the primary source of haze in white wines. Although bentonite fining is still routinely used in winemaking, alternative methods to selectively remove haze proteins without affecting wine organoleptic properties are needed. The availability of pure TLPs and CHIs would facilitate the research for the identification of such technological advances. Therefore, we proposed the usage of recombinant TLP (rTLP) and CHI (rCHI), expressed by <i>Komagataella phaffii</i>, as haze-protein models, since they showed similar characteristics (aggregation potential, melting point, functionality, glycosylation levels and bentonite adsorption) to the native-haze proteins from <i>Vitis vinifera</i>. Hence, rTLP and rCHI can be applied to study haze formation mechanisms on a molecular level and to explore alternative fining methods by screening proteolytic enzymes and ideal adsorptive resins.
