### Title
The HP1 protein interactome of mouse embryonic stem cells

### Description
The family of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) consists of highly conserved proteins, which have important functions in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In mammals there are three HP1 paralogs: HP1(alpha), Hp1(beta), and Hp1(gamma)They are encoded by the Cbx5, Cbx1, and Cbx3 genes, respectively. Hp1 and Hp1 stably interact with Chd4 and Adnp to form the ChAHP complex. In this project, Chd4, Adnp, and the three Cbx genes were endogenously tagged with a FLAG-Avi tag in mouse embryonic stem cells. The tagged proteins were subjected to tandem-affinity purification and analysis by mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
All 5 proteins were FLAG-Avi-tagged and tandem-affinity purified, except for the Adnp to Chd4 comparison, where the samples were only strep-purified. Proteins were trypsinized directly on the magnetic Sterpdavidin beads. The generated peptides were acidified with TFA to a final concentration of 0.8% and analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with an EASY-nLC 1000 using the two column set-up (Thermo Scientific).  The peptides were loaded with 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile in H2O onto a peptide trap (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75um x 2cm, C18, 3um, 100Å) at a constant pressure of 800 bar. Peptides were separated, at a flow rate of 150 nl/min with a linear gradient of 2–6% buffer B in buffer A in 3 minutes followed by an linear increase from 6 to 22% in 40 minutes, 22-28% in 9 min, 28-36% in 8min, 36-80% in 1 min and the column was finally washed for 14 min at 80% B (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) on a 50um x 15cm ES801 C18, 2um, 100Å column (Thermo Scientific) mounted on a DPV ion source (New Objective) connected to a Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Scientific). The data were acquired using 120000 resolution for the peptide measurements in the Orbitrap and a top T (3s) method with HCD fragmentation for each precursor and fragment measurement in the ion trap according the recommendation of the manufacturer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and relative quantification of the proteins was done with MaxQuant version 1.5.3.8 using Andromeda as search engine (Cox et al., 2011) and label free quantification (LFQ. Cox et al., 2014) as described in Hubner et al. The mouse subset of the UniProt version 2015_01 combined with the contaminant DB from MaxQuant was searched and the protein and peptide FDR were set to 0.01. All MaxQuant parameters can be found in the uploaded parameterfile: mqpar.xml.   Statistical analysis was done in Perseus version 1.5.2.6  (Cox , 2011, 2014; Tyanova, 2016). Results were filtered to remove reverse hits, contaminants and peptides found in only one sample. Missing values were imputed and potential interactors were determined using t-test and visualized by a volcano plot. Significance lines corresponding to a given FDR have been determined by a permutation-based method (Tusher, 2001). Threshold values (FDR) were selected between 0.005 and 0.05 and SO (curve bend) between 0.2 and 2 and are shown in the corresponding figures. Results were exported from Perseus and visualized using statistical computing language R.

### Publication Abstract
De novo mutations in ADNP, which encodes activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), have recently been found to underlie Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome, a complex neurological developmental disorder that also affects several other organ functions <sup>1</sup> . ADNP is a putative transcription factor that is essential for embryonic development <sup>2</sup> . However, its precise roles in transcriptional regulation and development are not understood. Here we show that ADNP interacts with the chromatin remodeller CHD4 and the chromatin architectural protein HP1 to form a stable complex, which we refer to as ChAHP. Besides mediating complex assembly, ADNP recognizes DNA motifs that specify binding of ChAHP to euchromatin. Genetic ablation of ChAHP components in mouse embryonic stem cells results in spontaneous differentiation concomitant with premature activation of lineage-specific genes and in a failure to differentiate towards the neuronal lineage. Molecularly, ChAHP-mediated repression is fundamentally different from canonical HP1-mediated silencing: HP1 proteins, in conjunction with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), are thought to assemble broad heterochromatin domains that are refractory to transcription. ChAHP-mediated repression, however, acts in a locally restricted manner by establishing inaccessible chromatin around its DNA-binding sites and does not depend on H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes. Together, our results reveal that ADNP, via the recruitment of HP1 and CHD4, regulates the expression of genes that are crucial for maintaining distinct cellular states and assures accurate cell fate decisions upon external cues. Such a general role of ChAHP in governing cell fate plasticity may explain why ADNP mutations affect several organs and body functions and contribute to cancer progression<sup>1,3,4</sup>. Notably, we found that the integrity of the ChAHP complex is disrupted by nonsense mutations identified in patients with Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome, and this could be rescued by aminoglycosides that suppress translation termination <sup>5</sup> . Therefore, patients might benefit from therapeutic agents that are being developed to promote ribosomal read-through of premature stop codons<sup>6,7</sup>.
