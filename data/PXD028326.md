### Title
Short poly(A) tails are protected from deadenylation by the LARP1-PABP complex

### Description
To find PABPC1-interactants in cells, PABPC1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
PABPC1-immunoprecipitates were prepraed from cell lysates incubated with monoclonal anti-PABPC1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates using anti-Myc antibodies were used for control. To obtain interactors via protein-protein interactions only, RNase A was treated. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by 8M urea, treated with DTT and iodoacetamide (IAA), and finally added by ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) buffer to dilute urea at final 1M. Protein samples were digested by trypsin and analyzed by Q Exactive (LC-MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS raw data was analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.5.3.30. Log2 fold change for PABPC1-immunorecipitates over Myc-immunoprecipitates were calculated using LFQ intensity for each sample in ProteinGroups.txt among MaxQuant output files. Pseudocount (1E4) was considered prior to calculate the log2 fold change.
