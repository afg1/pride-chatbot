### Title
A human BCRP (ABCG2) cell line without MDR1 (ABCB1) background â€“improved models for drug efflux studies using CRISPR-Cas

### Description
Proteomics data of two MDCK-cMDR1 KO cell lines expressing either hBCRP or hMDR1 drug transporters, generated with CRISPR-Cas9.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed in 2% SDS and subjected to multi-enzyme digestion filter-aided sample preparation (MED-FASP) protocol, where proteins were digested with LysC and trypsin. Peptides were quantified using a Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific ).

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS data was processed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16), where proteins were identified by searching MS and MS/MS data of peptides against the canine UniProtKB (UP000002254) with the addition of human BCRP and MDR1. Spectral raw intensities were normalized with variance stabilization (vsn), and were subsequently used to calculate the protein concentrations using the Total Protein Approach.
