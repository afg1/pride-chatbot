### Title
anti-fungal effectors delivered by the Type VI secretion system - a proteomic analysis

### Description
Targeting a new kingdom: anti-fungal effectors delivered by the Type VI secretion system

### Sample Protocol
Mass spectrometry  analysis of Serratia marcescens cellular proteome has been been performedin current LC-MSMS analysis and samples were injected on the LTQ Orbitrap Velos. Mass spectrometry analysis of bacterially-intoxicated C. albicans proteome  has been performed in ia current LC MSMS analysis. After digestion samples were labelled with TMT-6plex and fractionation using the hSAX fractionation. The 40 collected fractions were pooled into 6 samples for each replicates and injected on the Orbitrap Fusion using the multinotch SPS MS3 quantification.

### Data Protocol
All samples were processed via MaxQuant and Andromeda search engine for identification of bacterial and yeast proteome. LAbel free quantification as well as Tandem mass Tag quantification were processed using Andromeda search engine
