### Title
Differential proteomic analysis by SWATH-MS unravels the most dominant mechanisms underlying yeast adaptation to nonoptimal temperatures under anaerobic conditions- SWATH data

### Description
Elucidation of the mechanism of temperature tolerance in yeast is essential for enhancing cellular robustness of strains, providing more economically and sustainable sound industrial processes. We investigated the differential responses of three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, an industrial wine strain, ADY5, a laboratory strain, CEN.PK113-7D and an industrial bioethanol strain, Ethanol Red, grown at sub- (12 ºC) and-supra (39 ºC) optimal temperatures under chemostat conditions, in which specific growth rate–dependent changes are eliminated. In contrast to previous studies, we employed anaerobic conditions, mimicking the industrial processes. The proteomic profile of these strains was performed by SWATH-MS, allowing the quantification of 997 proteins. Our analysis revealed that temperature response differs between the strains, highlighting the precision with which each strain responds to changes in its environment; however, we also found some common responsive proteins among the strains, revealing that the response to temperature involves general stress and specific mechanisms. Overall, sub-optimal temperature conditions involved a higher remodeling of the proteome than supra-optimal temperature. Further, the proteomic data evidenced that the cold response involves a strong repression of translation related proteins as well as induction of amino acid metabolism, together with components related to protein folding and degradation. On the other hand, the high temperature response mainly recruits amino acid metabolism. Our study provides a global and thorough insight into how growth temperature affects yeast proteome, which can be a step forward for research regarding the comprehension and the improvement of yeast thermotolerance.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts from total cell were clarified by centrifugation at 15000g during 10 min and precipitated according to the TCA/Acetone protocol. Briefly, the treated samples were diluted (equal volume of the initial sample) in cold acetone solution, stirred and stored at 4 ºC during 10 min. Then, the samples were subjected to centrifugation 15000g for 15min and the supernatants were discarded. The total of the precipitated proteins was taken for one dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE).  The protein samples were digested with 500 ng of sequencing grade trypsin (V511, Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA) and incubated at 37 °C following the protocol described by Shevchenko et al. [21]. The trypsin digestion was stopped by the addition of 10 % trifuoroacetic (TFA) and the supernatant, containing the non-extracted digests, was removed, leaving behind the sliced gels in the Eppendorf tube, which were dehydrate with pure acetonitrile (ACN). The new peptide solutions were carefully combined with the corresponding supernatant and dried in a speed vacuum. Next, they were re-suspended in 2 % ACN and 0.1 % TFA prior to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses.  The digested peptides recovered were examined by LC using a NanoLC Ultra 1-D plus Eksigent (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA, USA) connected to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA). Briefly, 5 µL of each digested sample were loaded onto a trap NanoLC pre-column (3 μm particles size C18-CL, 0.5 mm × 300 m, Eksigent Technologies) and desalted with 0.1% TFA at 3µL/min during 5 min. Then, the digested peptides present in the samples were separated using an analytical column (LC Column, 3 μm particles size C18-C, 75 µm ×12cm, Nikk Technos Co®, Tokyo, Japan), equilibrated in 5% ACN and 0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptide elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 5% to 35% of ACN containing 0.1% FA at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min over 90 min. The eluted peptides were thereafter analyzed with a spectrometer nanoESI-qQTOF (AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600) coupled to the NanoLC sysntem. The TripleTOf was operated in SWATH mode, in which a 0.050s TOF MS scan from 350 to 1250m/z was performed, followed by 0.080s product ion scans from 350 to 1250 m/z in the 32 defined windows (3.05 sec/cycle). The rolling collision energies equations were set for all ions as for 2+ ions according to the equation |CE|=(slope) × (m/z) + (intercept), with Charge = 2; Slope = 0.0575 and Intercept = 9.

### Data Protocol
The  Protein Pilot 5.0  group file, including spectral library data, was analyzed by PeakView® (version 2.1, AB SCIEX) and peaks from SWATHS runs were extracted with a peptide confidence threshold of 95 %  and a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1 % at protein level.

### Publication Abstract
Elucidation of temperature tolerance mechanisms in yeast is essential for enhancing cellular robustness of strains, providing more economically and sustainable processes. We investigated the differential responses of three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, an industrial wine strain, ADY5, a laboratory strain, CEN.PK113-7D and an industrial bioethanol strain, Ethanol Red, grown at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures under chemostat conditions. We employed anaerobic conditions, mimicking the industrial processes. The proteomic profile of these strains in all conditions was performed by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS), allowing the quantification of 997 proteins, data available via ProteomeXchange (PXD016567). Our analysis demonstrated that temperature responses differ between the strains; however, we also found some common responsive proteins, revealing that the response to temperature involves general stress and specific mechanisms. Overall, sub-optimal temperature conditions involved a higher remodeling of the proteome. The proteomic data evidenced that the cold response involves strong repression of translation-related proteins as well as induction of amino acid metabolism, together with components related to protein folding and degradation while, the high temperature response mainly recruits amino acid metabolism. Our study provides a global and thorough insight into how growth temperature affects the yeast proteome, which can be a step forward in the comprehension and improvement of yeast thermotolerance.
