### Title
Toll-like receptor 2 activation depends on lipopeptide shedding by bacterial surfactants

### Description
Sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens is a major fatal disease but its molecular basis remains elusive. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has been implicated in the orchestration of inflammation and sepsis but its role appears to vary for different pathogen species and clones. Accordingly, Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates differ substantially in their capacity to activate TLR2. Here we show that strong TLR2 stimulation depends on high-level production of phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides in response to the global virulence activator Agr. PSMs are required for mobilizing lipoproteins, the TLR2 agonists, from the staphylococcal cytoplasmic membrane. Notably, the course of sepsis caused by PSM-deficient S. aureus is similar in wild-type and TLR2-deficient mice, but TLR2 is required for protection of mice against PSM-producing S. aureus. Thus, a crucial role of TLR2 depends on agonist release by bacterial surfactants. Modulation of this process may lead to new therapeutic strategies against Gram-positive infections.

### Sample Protocol
Three biological replicates of USA300 wild-type or mutant culture filtrates grown overnight in TSB were analysed. The same protein amount measured by Bradford assay in culture filtrates of the various strains was used for exoprotein precipitation with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4°C. After centrifugation at 13,200 rpm at 4°C for 15 min the supernatants were discarded and precipitated proteins were air dried. For nanoLC-MS/MS analysis dried proteins were dissolved in a buffer containing 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10 mM Tris at pH 8.0 and digested in solution. Peptide mixtures were then separated on an EasyLC nano-HPLC (Proxeon Biosystems) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted with an 87-min segmented gradient of 5–33-90% HPLC solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid). Each sample was run in technical triplicates.

### Data Protocol
Acquired MS spectra were processed with the MaxQuant software package version 1.2.2.9 with integrated Andromeda search engine. Database searches were performed against a target decoy S. aureus USA300 database obtained from Uniprot, containing 5,295 protein entries and 248 commonly observed contaminants. The label-free algorithm was enabled as was the “match between runs” option. Label-free quantification (LFQ) protein intensities from the MaxQuant data output were used for relative protein quantification.
