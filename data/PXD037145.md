### Title
Proteomic analysis of human chondrocytes

### Description
Proteins from chondrocytes incubated in various conditions were extracted and subjected to label-free shotgun proteomics for establishing differences between conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted and loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, treated with chemical reagents for fixing the cysteine modification or untreated, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry with an Exploris 480 instrument.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed, spectral counts and NSAF were extracted and compared.
