### Title
Proteomic analysis of cuticle protein in Nilaparvata lugens

### Description
The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is the most destructive pest of rice and causes serious economic damage in Asia. Understanding the composition of Nilaparvata lugens cuticle protein will help pest control. In this study, Nilaparvata lugens cuticle was disserted, and underwent shotgun MS/MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
The fifth instar Nilaparvata lugens were collected, and their cuticle was carefully disserted in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.47 mM KH2PO4 at pH 7.4) using sharp forceps. Sample digested and MS procedure was performed as we previously described (Huang et al., 2016, Jorunal of Proteome Research, Screening and Functional Analyses of Nilaparvata lugens Salivary Proteome).

### Data Protocol
The shotgun-based proteomic data of N. lugens (ProteomeXchange accession:) were proceeded using the software MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 with default parameters: tolerance of one missed cleavages of trypsin, carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term). The identifications were filtered to 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at peptide-spectrum match (PSM) level.
