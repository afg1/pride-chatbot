### Title
Proteomics on Nav1.8-positive nociceptors of mouse DRG

### Description
Nociceptors play an essential role in both acute pain and chronic pain conditions. In this study, we examined the proteome of mouse dorsal root ganglia and compared NaV1.8Cre+/-; ROSA26-flox-stop-flox-DTA (Diphtheria toxin fragment A) mutant mice (NaV1.8Cre-DTA), in which NaV1.8-positive neurons (mainly nociceptors) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were ablated, with respective littermate wildtype controls.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation, pan-mouse spectral library generation, and DIA-MS were performed by Biognosys (Zurich, Switzerland) as previously reported by Barry et al, 2018 (doi:10.3389/fnmol.2018.00259; http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS01241)  and Bruderer et al., 2017 (doi: 10.1002/pmic.201700021; http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS00782).

### Data Protocol
Data were processed as previously reported by Barry et al, 2018 (doi:10.3389/fnmol.2018.00259; http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS01241) and Bruderer et al., 2017 (doi: 10.1002/pmic.201700021; http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS00782), and analyzed with Spectronaut (Biognosys AG, Switzerland) with default settings and precursor and protein FDR set at 0.01. Both analysis modes library-dependent and library-independent (directDIA) were used in Spectronaut X (Biognosys AG, Switzerland) and results were combined. Analysis was based on mouse UniProt .fasta downloaded January 2019.
