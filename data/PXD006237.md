### Title
Contrasting Effects of Acclimated Copper Limitation on the Photosynthetic Apparatus in Two Strains of the open ocean diatom Thalassiosira oceanica

### Description
The physiological adaptations of diatoms to cope with Cu limitation are largely unknown. In the present study we investigated the response to Cu limitation in two strains of the model open ocean diatom T. oceanica (CCMP 1003 and CCMP 1005), focusing on physiological and proteomic changes in the photosynthetic apparatus. Our results show remarkable differences between the adaptations of TO05 and TO03 to low Cu, highlighting significant intra specific variations.

### Sample Protocol
Two strains of Thalassiosira oceanica cultures were grown (TO03 and TO05, triplicates), harvested, lysed with glass beads, and soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by 100,000g 1 hour spin. Proteins then were trypsin digested, stage tipped, and dimethylated (light for control, medium for low Cu growth condition, heavy for low Fe/Cu growth condition). TO03 sample set were analyzed with Thermo LTQ-Velos, and TO05 sample set was analyzed with Bruker Qtof system.

### Data Protocol
Both dataset were searched and quantitated with MaxQuant version 1.5.1.0 with triple dimethylation, re-quantification and match between runs enabled on top of the default search settings against two combination of sequence libraries: EST RNAseq data of TO03 and the published TO05 genome library.
