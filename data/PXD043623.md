### Title
An oligosaccharyltransferase from Leishmania donovani increases the N-glycan occupancy on plant-produced IgG1

### Description
The monoclonal antibodies rituximab and cetuximab were transiently expressed in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plants and purified by affinity chromatography using protein A. Purified antibodies were analysed by intact MS. Purified antibodies were also subjected to trypsin digestion followed by LC-ESI-MS analysis of the glycopeptide carrying the N-glycsylation site Asn297 using the LC-OTMS, Orbitrap Exploris 480 from Thermo Scientific.

### Sample Protocol
Nicotiana benthamiana grown on soil in a growth chamber, with 16h light/8h dark at 24°C and 50% humidity. Leaves infiltrated with agrobacteria (strain UIA 143, pMP90) carrying the plasmid for protein expression (expression vector pEAQ-HT) were harvested 4 days after infiltration. Leaf material was either directly processed or stored at -80°C.

### Data Protocol
Detection was performed with an Orbitap MS (Exploris 480, Thermo) equipped with the standard H-ESI source in positive ion, DDA mode (= switching to MSMS mode for eluting peaks). MS-scans were recorded (range: 350-2500 Da) and the 8 highest peaks were selected for fragmentation. Instrument calibration was performed using Pierce FlexMix Calibration Solution (Thermo Scientific).

### Publication Abstract
N-Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) at the heavy chain Fc domain (Asn297) plays an important role for antibody structure and effector functions. While numerous recombinant IgG1 antibodies have been successfully expressed in plants, they frequently display a considerable amount (up to 50%) of unglycosylated Fc domain. To overcome this limitation, we tested a single-subunit oligosaccharyltransferase from the protozoan <i>Leishmania donovani</i> (LdOST) for its ability to improve IgG1 Fc glycosylation. LdOST fused to a fluorescent protein was transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and confocal microscopy confirmed the subcellular location at the endoplasmic reticulum. Transient co-expression of LdOST with two different IgG1 antibodies resulted in a significant increase (up to 97%) of Fc glycosylation while leaving the overall N-glycan composition unmodified, as determined by different mass spectrometry approaches. While biochemical and functional features of "glycosylation improved" antibodies remained unchanged, a slight increase in Fc&#x3b3;RIIIa binding and thermal stability was observed. Collectively, our results reveal that LdOST expression is suitable to reduce the heterogeneity of plant-produced antibodies and can contribute to improving their stability and effector functions.
