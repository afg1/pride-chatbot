### Title
Porcine LC-MSMS -  Porcine Breast Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel for Spatial Tissue Culture

### Description
Porcine breast fatty extracellular matrix proetiens has been extracted after decellularization of fatty tissue with conventional method (PFT-1) using triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate and extracted with modified methods keeping natural protein in their natural condition using X-100, urea, thiourea etc

### Sample Protocol
Sample is first decellularised as mentioned above and proteins have been extracted and proteiomic analysis has been performed

### Data Protocol
Data processing has been performed using luquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.  ProteaseMax (Promega) has been used for the proteomic analysis and UniProt database has been used for data processing.

### Publication Abstract
Porcine mammary fatty tissues represent an abundant source of natural biomaterial for generation of breast-specific extracellular matrix (ECM). Here we report the extraction of total ECM proteins from pig breast fatty tissues, the fabrication of hydrogel and porous scaffolds from the extracted ECM proteins, the structural properties of the scaffolds (tissue matrix scaffold, TMS), and the applications of the hydrogel in human mammary epithelial cell spatial cultures for cell surface receptor expression, metabolomics characterization, acini formation, proliferation, migration between different scaffolding compartments, and in vivo tumor formation. This model system provides an additional option for studying human breast diseases such as breast cancer.
