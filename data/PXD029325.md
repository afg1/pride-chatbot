### Title
Guidance landscapes unveiled by quantitative proteomics to control reinnervation in adult visual system

### Description
Long-distance regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) has been achieved from the eye to the brain through activation of neuronal molecular pathways or pharmacological approaches. Characterizing the mature neuronal environment is essential to understand the adult axonal guidance in order to complete the circuit reconstruction. To this end, we used mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics to characterize the proteomes of major nuclei of the adult visual system: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ventral and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN, dLGN) and superior colliculus (SCol)), as well as the optic chiasm. These analyses revealed the presence of guidance molecules and guidance-associated factors in the adult visual targets. Moreover, by performing bilateral optic nerve crush, we showed that the expression of specific proteins was significantly modulated by the injury in the visual targets, even in the ones most distal to the lesion site. On another hand, we found that the expression of guidance molecules was not modified upon injury and that regenerative axons are able to respond to guidance cues. Together, our results provide an extensive characterization of the molecular environment in intact and injured conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from tissue preparations were solubilized in Laemmli buffer before being stacked in the top of a 4–12% NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies), stained with R-250 Coomassie blue (Bio-Rad) and in-gel digested using modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) as previously described (Salvetti et al., 2016). The dried extracted peptides were resuspended in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and the Q-Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Optic chiasm and SCN samples Peptides were sampled on a 300μm 5mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated on a 75μm x 250mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH). The nano-LC method consisted of a 240min multi-linear gradient at a flow rate of 300nl/min, ranging from 5 to 33% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. dlGN, vLGN and SCol samples Peptides were sampled on a 300μm 5mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated on a 200cm μPACTM column (PharmaFluidics, Ghent, Belgium). The nano-LC method consisted of a 360min multi-linear gradient at a flow rate of 300nl/min, ranging from 5 to 33% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. For all tissues, the spray voltage was set at 2 kV and the heated capillary was adjusted to 270°C. Survey full-scan MS spectra (m/z = 400–1600) were acquired with a resolution of 60 000 after the accumulation of 3 x 106 ions (maximum filling time 200ms). The 20 most intense ions were fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation after the accumulation of 105 ions (maximum filling time: 50ms). MS and MS/MS data were acquired using the software Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Data were processed automatically using Mascot Distiller software (version 2.7.1.0, Matrix Science). Peptides and proteins were identified using Mascot (version 2.6) through concomitant searches against Uniprot (Mus Musculus taxonomy, for Optic chiasm and SCN samples, downloaded in June 2019 with 87573 entries, and for dlGN, vLGN and SCol samples, downloaded in August 2020 with 87975 entries), classical contaminants database (homemade) and their corresponding reversed databases. Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set, respectively, to 10ppm and 25mmu. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: carbamidomethylation (fixed), acetyl (protein N-terminal, variable) and oxidation (variable). The Proline software (version 2.0) (Bouyssié et al., 2020) was used to merge either all intact brain targets together or intact and injured data together but for each brain target separately. After combination, results were filtered: conservation of rank 1 peptide-spectrum match (PSM) with a minimal length of 7 and a minimal score of 25. Peptide-spectrum matching (PSM) score filtering is then optimized to reach a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of PSM identification below 1% by employing the target decoy approach. A minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group was set. For computing results of intact brain targets, Proline was used to perform MS1-based label free quantification of the peptides and protein groups from the different samples without cross-assignment; protein abundances were computed as the sum of specific peptide abundances; for each tissue, an average iBAQ value (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011) across replicates was then calculated. For producing quantitative results of intact brain targets versus injured ones, Proline was used to perform MS1-based label free quantification of the peptides and protein groups from the different samples with cross-assignment activated. After peptide abundances normalization, protein abundances were computed as a sum of specific peptide abundances.

### Publication Abstract
In the injured adult central nervous system (CNS), activation of pro-growth molecular pathways in neurons leads to long-distance regeneration. However, most regenerative fibers display guidance defects, which prevent reinnervation and functional recovery. Therefore, the molecular characterization of the proper target regions of regenerative axons is essential to uncover the modalities of adult reinnervation. In this study, we use mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics to address the proteomes of major nuclei of the adult visual system. These analyses reveal that guidance-associated molecules are expressed in adult visual targets. Moreover, we show that bilateral optic nerve injury modulates the expression of specific proteins. In contrast, the expression of guidance molecules remains steady. Finally, we show that regenerative axons are able to respond to guidance cues ex vivo, suggesting that these molecules possibly interfere with brain target reinnervation in adult. Using a long-distance regeneration model, we further demonstrate that the silencing of specific guidance signaling leads to rerouting of regenerative axons in vivo. Altogether, our results suggest ways to modulate axon guidance of regenerative neurons to achieve circuit repair in adult.
