### Title
Mass spectrometric and bio-computational analysis of multiply charged RNase S gas phase complexes obtained by electrospray ionization from varying in-solution equilibrium conditions

### Description
In this project we investigate the influence of a solvent's composition on the stability of desorbed and multiply  charged RNase S ions by analyzing gas phase dissociation reactions triggered by collision induced dissociation (CID)  of multiply charged complex ions. RNase S was dissolved in ESI-compatible buffers with either an increasing content of organic  co-solvent or with different pH. Direct transition of all ions from the in-solution components is followed by CID of the non-covalent  RNase S complex and by quantitative analysis of the dissociation products. From normalized ion abundances are determined the apparent  kinetic and apparent thermodynamic gas phase complex properties. The stability of RNase S in the gas phase is independent from the  in-solution equilibrium but sensitive to differences in charge states.

### Sample Protocol
ITEM-TWO measurements were performed using a Q-TOF 2 instrument (Waters MS-Technologies, Manchester, UK)  with the following instrumental settings: source temperature, 40°C; capillary voltage, 1.1kV; sample cone voltage, 20V;  extractor cone voltage, 3V; collision voltage, 3V; pusher time, 88us. The Quadrupole and ToF analyzer pressures were typically  between ca. 2.0x10 E–5mbar and 2.50x10 E–7mbar, respectively.

### Data Protocol
For nano ESI mass spectra of RNase S from 10-40% methanol/200mM ammonium acetate the Savitzky-Golay method was used  for smoothing in 6 cycles with a window of 12, for the pH-dependent acquisitions it was smoothed in 10 cycles with a window of 10.  Three RNase S datasets, each, were acquired with RNase S dissolved in 10-40% methanol/200mM ammonium acetate and individual scans  were accumulated to generate spectra at the respective collisional cell voltage differences. For every acquisition, except for 20% methanol/200mM  ammonium acetate for which two datasets were applied, scan numbers per collision cell voltage difference were as follows. 1) 10% methanol/200mM ammonium acetate:  First set: 081018_RNASE_S_2.raw: scans 878-1053, 3V; 1087-1176, 8V; 1245-1380, 11V; 1395-1574, 13V; 1558-1747, 15V; 1766-1908, 17V; 1926-2065, 20V; 2077-2239, 30V; 2318-2442, 50V.

The heights of the ion signals (in arbitrary units) were obtained from the mass spectra at all applied collision cell voltage differences,  separately for each setting using MassLynx 4.0. These ion intensities were plotted against their respective m/z values and fitted to a  Gaussian curve using Origin Pro 2018b (64bit) (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA). Intensities for each molecular species or  complex were determined from the heights of the apices as well as the average charge states.

### Publication Abstract
We investigated the influence of a solvent's composition on the stability of desorbed and multiply charged RNAse S ions by analyzing the non-covalent complex's gas-phase dissociation processes. RNAse S was dissolved in electrospray ionization-compatible buffers with either increasing organic co-solvent content or different pHs. The direct transition of all the ions and the evaporation of the solvent from all the in-solution components of RNAse S under the respective in-solution conditions by electrospray ionization was followed by a collision-induced dissociation of the surviving non-covalent RNAse S complex ions. Both types of changes of solvent conditions yielded in mass spectrometrically observable differences of the in-solution complexation equilibria. Through quantitative analysis of the dissociation products, i.e., from normalized ion abundances of RNAse S, S-protein, and S-peptide, the apparent kinetic and apparent thermodynamic gas-phase complex properties were deduced. From the experimental data, it is concluded that the stability of RNAse S in the gas phase is independent of its in-solution equilibrium but is sensitive to the complexes' gas-phase charge states. Bio-computational in-silico studies showed that after desolvation and ionization by electrospray, the remaining binding forces kept the S-peptide and S-protein together in the gas phase predominantly by polar interactions, which indirectly stabilized the in-bulk solution predominating non-polar intermolecular interactions. As polar interactions are sensitive to in-solution protonation, bio-computational results provide an explanation of quantitative experimental data with single amino acid residue resolution.
