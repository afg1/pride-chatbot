### Title
Integrative Genomics Positions MKRN1 as a Novel Ribonucleoprotein within the Embryonic Stem Cell Gene Regulatory Network

### Description
For identification of proteins that associate with Makorin1 (MKRN1) in RNA-dependent and RNA-independent manners, we affinity purified FLAG-tagged Makorin1 (MKRN1) from mouse embryonic stem cells constitutively expressing FLAG:MKRN1.  Anti-FLAG control immunoprecipitations were performed from a FLAG vectrol control (FLAG:Ctrl) mouse embryonic stem cell line that did not express FLAG:MKRN1.  Following FLAG immunoprecipitation, anti-FLAG beads from FLAG:MKRN1 and FLAG:Ctrl immunoprecipitations were split into separate tubes such that half of the beads were digested with 200Ã∞â≈ Ã≠Âµg/mL RNase A while the other half of the beads were undigested. RNase A-digested and undigested immunoprecipitates were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Of the 48 RNA-related proteins previously identified to associate with FLAG:MKRN1, L1TD1, PABPC1, PABPC4, YBX1, IGF2BP1 and UPF1 were found to remain associated with FLAG:MKRN1 in the presence of RNase A.

### Sample Protocol
FLAG:MKRN1 overexpression and FLAG vector control (FLAG:Ctrl) ESC clones were expanded in feeder-free culture conditions such that a minimum of 10^8 ESCs from each population were available for each immunoprecipitation experiment.  Cells were washed with ice cold PBS prior to lysis with TNTE lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl Ã∞Â¯Ã≠Â¬Ã¢â≈√ uoride (PMSF), 0.5% TritonX-100; pH 7.4) containing 1x Complete protease inhibitors (Roche) followed by gentle rocking at 4oC for 20 min. Whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g and total protein in the resultant supernatants was quantified using the Bradford assay. For each IP, 4.0 mg of total protein was used. Prior to the IP, lysates were pre-cleared with 150 Ã∞â™≥Ã∂â•¢L of a 20% slurry of protein G sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) while agitating at 4oC for 1 h. Subsequently, cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 100 Ã∞â™≥Ã∂â•¢L of a 50% slurry anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to magnetic beads (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) while agitating at 4oC for 1 h. Following the IP, beads were washed extensively in NT2 wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40; pH 7.4). Following five washes, the anti-FLAG beads suspension was split into two fresh 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes such that half of the anti-FLAG beads from the FLAG:MKRN1 and FLAG:Ctrl lysates were digested with 200Ã∞â≈ Ã≠Âµg/mL RNase A in -/- PBS for 1 h while rocking at room temperature, and the other half of the beads were left to rock in -/- PBS only. Proteins that remained bound to anti-FLAG beads were washed twice with NT2 buffer prior to trypsinization in preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
The RAW files generated by XCalibur (Thermo Scientific) were converted into DTA or mzXML files and searched using SEQUEST against 16,253 mouse proteins from the UniProt/SwissProt database.

### Publication Abstract
In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs) coordinate gene expression to maintain ESC identity; however, the complete repertoire of factors regulating the ESC state is not fully understood. Our previous temporal microarray analysis of ESC commitment identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein Makorin-1 (MKRN1) as a potential novel component of the ESC GRN. Here, using multilayered systems-level analyses, we compiled a MKRN1-centered interactome in undifferentiated ESCs at the proteomic and ribonomic level. Proteomic analyses in undifferentiated ESCs revealed that MKRN1 associates with RNA-binding proteins, and ensuing RIP-chip analysis determined that MKRN1 associates with mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins including proteins that function during cellular stress. Subsequent biological validation identified MKRN1 as a novel stress granule-resident protein, although MKRN1 is not required for stress granule formation, or survival of unstressed ESCs. Thus, our unbiased systems-level analyses support a role for the E3 ligase MKRN1 as a ribonucleoprotein within the ESC GRN.
