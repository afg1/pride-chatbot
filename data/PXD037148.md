### Title
Changes of Protein Expression after CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout of miRNA-142 in Cell Lines Derived from Diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma  // Proteome Dataset

### Description
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by inhibiting protein synthesis of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). MicroRNA-142 (miR-142), which has tumor-suppressive properties, was functionally deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in cell lines derived from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a highly aggressive tumor that represents about 30% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma worldwide. Mutations in miR-142 affect about 20% of all cases of DLBCL. By proteome analyses, the miR-142 knockout resulted in a consistent up-regulation of 52 but also down-regulation of 41 proteins in the GC-DLBCL lines BJAB and SUDHL4. Various mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were up-regulated in line with their pro-tumorigenic properties, while proteins necessary for MHC-I presentation were down-regulated in accordance with the finding that miR-142 knockout mice have a defective immune response. Of the deregulated proteins/genes, CFL2, CLIC4, STAU1, and TWF1 are known targets of miR-142, and we could additionally confirm AKT1S1, CCNB1, LIMA1, and TFRC as new targets of miR-142-3p or -5p. We further show that seed-sequence mutations of miR-142 can be used to confirm potential targets and that miRNA knockout cell lines might thus be used to identify novel targets of miRNAs. Due to the complex contribution of miRNAs within cellular regulatory networks, in particular when a miRNA highly present in the RISC complex is deleted and can be replaced by other endogenous miRNAs, primary effects on gene expression may be covered by secondary layers of regulation

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets (5 biological replicates per cell type) were lysed in 8 M Urea/0.4 M NH4HCO3 by 5 min sonication (Sonopuls GM3200 with BR30 cup booster, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). For further lysis, samples were centrifuged through QIAShredder devices (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay [43]. To ensure a maximum of reproducibility, all lysates were adjusted to a protein concentration of 2 µg/µl using 8 M Urea/0.4 M NH4HCO3. 10 µg of protein were reduced using dithioerythritol (final concentration 5 mM) for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequent alkylation of cysteines was done with iodoacetamide (final concentration 15 mM) for 30 min in the dark. Prior to tryptic digestion, samples were diluted with H2O to give 1 M Urea. Digestion was performed using 200 ng of modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C. 1 µg of each sample was injected in an Ultimate 3000 nano-chromatography system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and transferred to a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 µm x 2cm, 5 µm particles, 100Å, ThermoFisher Scientific). Separation was performed at 250 nL/min using a 50 cm reversed-phase separation column (PepMap RSLC C18 2 µm 100 Å 75 µm × 50 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Solvent A was 0.1 % formic acid in water and B 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile. The chromatography method consisted of a 160 min gradient from 3% to 25% and a second 10 min gradient from 25% to 40% solvent B. Eluting peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive HF X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a top 15 data-dependent method.

### Data Protocol
Data processing, peptide search and quantification was done with MaxQuant (v.1.6.7.0) and the human subset of the UniProt database. Results were filtered to give a false discovery rate of < 1%. Statistics, principal component analysis as well as hierarchical cluster, volcano plot, and scatter plot analyses were performed in Perseus (v.1.5.3.2).
