### Title
NleH LFQ phoshoproteome analysis (EThcD runs)

### Description
Using Phosphopeptide enrichment and MS analysis the effect of NleH1 and NleH2 on the phosphoproteome of host cells was investigated - EThcD runs of samples

### Sample Protocol
Three biological replicates of each condition (uninfected, WT infected , detla NleH1 NleH2 infected, pNleH1 infected and pNleH2 infection) were lyzed, acetone precipated and digested with trypsin overnight. Peptide were cleaned up with tC18 sep-pak columans and then enriched using TiO2 based enrichment. Enriched samples were analyzed ona Fusion lumos using 2 hr analyical graidents with EThcD fragmentation.   Note:  Samples 1,6,11 are uninfected Samples 2,7,12 are WT infection Samples 3,8,13 are double nleH1/nleH2 KO infections Samples 4,9,14 ad double nleH1/nleH2 KO complemented with pNleH1 infections Samples 5,10,15 ad double nleH1/nleH2 KO complemented with pNleH2 infections

### Data Protocol
Data analyzsis was undertaken using Maxquant version 1.5.3.30 with the LFQ option enabled. Downstream processing was undertaken using Perseus 1.5.0.9
