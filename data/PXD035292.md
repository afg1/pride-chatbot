### Title
Artificial Intelligence in proteomic profiling of Cerebrospinal fluid from extraventricular drainage in child Medulloblastoma

### Description
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric malignant central nervous system tumor. Overall survival in MB depends on treatment tuning. There is the need for biomarkers of residual disease, and recurrence. We analysed the proteome of waste cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from extraventricular drainage (EVD) from 6 children bearing various subtypes of MB and 6 controls needing EVD insertion for unrelated causes. Samples included total CSF, Microvesicles, Exosomes, and proteins captured by combinatorial peptide ligand library (CPLL). Liquid Chromatography-Coupled Tandem Mass Spectrometry proteomics identified 3560 proteins in CSF from control and MB patients, 2412 (67.7%) of which were overlapping, and 346 (9.7%) and 805 (22.6%) exclusive. Multidimensional scaling analysis discriminated samples. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified those modules functionally associated with the samples. A ranked core of 192 proteins allowed distinguishing between control and MB samples. Machine learning highlighted long-chain fatty acid transport protein 4 (SLC27A4), and laminin B-type (LMNB1) as proteins that maximize the discrimination between control and MB samples, respectively. Artificial intelligence was able to distinguish between MB vs non-tumor/hemorrhagic controls. The two potential protein biomarkers for the discrimination between control and MB may guide therapy and predict recurrences, improving the MB patients quality of life.

### Sample Protocol
All samples were treated as reported in Bruschi et al (doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-00324-4). Briefly, samples were lysed, reduced and alkylated with iST-LYSE buffer (PreOmics) digested, and processed by iST protocol (doi. org/ 10. 1038/ nmeth. 2834). Digested samples were eluted with a 200 cm uPAC C18 column (PharmaFluidics) and the peptides were separated using a non-linear gradient of 5-45 % solution of 80% ACN, 5% DMSO, and 0.1% FA in 155 min at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. MS data were acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific).

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed with MaxQuant (doi. org/ 10. 1038/ nbt. 1511) software version 1.6.10.0. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was set for the identification of proteins, peptides and PSM (peptide-spectrum match). For peptide identification a minimum length of 6 amino acids was required. Andromeda engine, incorporated into MaxQuant software, was used to search MS/MS spectra against Uniprot human database (release UP000005640_9606 April 2019). In the processing the Acetyl (Protein N-Term), Oxidation (M) and Deamidation (NQ) were selected as variable modifications and the fixed modification was Carbamidomethyl (C).

Machine learning highlighted long-chain fatty acid transport protein 4 (SLC27A4) and laminin B-type (LMNB1) as proteins that maximized the discrimination between control and MB samples. Machine learning WGCNA and support vector machine learning were able to distinguish between MB versus non-tumor/hemorrhagic controls. The two potential protein biomarkers for the discrimination between control and MB may guide therapy and predict recurrences, improving the MB patients' quality of life.
