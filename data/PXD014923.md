### Title
Proteomic of XFZYD Treat Rat Traumatic brain injury with Tandem Mass Tags,We applied TMTs to detect DEPs,and finally screened 105 overlapping DEPs,among them, there were 17 reversal proteins.According to the bio-function analysis

### Description
We applied TMTs to detect and study DEPs in the brain cortex of rats in the acute phase of the TBI and revealed the possible mechanism of XFZYD in the treatment of TBI based on bioinformatics analysis.

### Sample Protocol
(1) Mix RIPA with protease inhibitor cocktail and 1mM PMSF immediately before use, chill on ice (2) ~ 100mg tissue (1 × 107 cell) in 1.5 mL ep, add 1000 µL RIPA buffer, homogenize or sonicate to dissolve at 4 °C (3) Centrifuge 15min at 4 °C with top speed, transfer the supernatant to new ep and keep it on ice

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were processed with MaxQuant (Version 1.5.6.0). The protein sequence database (Uniprot_organism_2016_09) was downloaded from UNIPROT. This database and its reverse decoy were then searched against by MaxQuant software. The quantification type was reporter ion MS2 with n-plex TMT specific to Lys (K) and unmodified N-term; Trypsin was set as specific enzyme with up to 3 miss cleavage; Oxidation [M] and Acetyl [protein N-term] were considered as variable modification (max number of modifications per peptide is 3), Carbamidomethyl [C] was set as fixed modification; Both peptide and protein FDR should be less than 0.01. Only unmodified unique peptides were used for quantification. All the other parameters were reserved as default.
