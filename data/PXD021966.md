### Title
Composition and origin of lung fluid proteome in premature infants and relationship to respiratory outcome

### Description
We performed global proteomics of premature infant tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma to determine the composition and source of lung fluid proteins and to identify potential biomarkers of respiratory outcome

### Sample Protocol
Tracheal aspirate samples were collected from intubated infants in the TOLSURF cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01022580) before and after nitric oxide treatment  and plasma was collected from NO CLD infants (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00000548) To examine proteins in the medium of cultured lung tissue, explants of human fetal lung were prepared and cultured in serum-free Waymouth’s medium Proteins in the samples were reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide, followed by digestion with trypsin and and mass spectrometry analysis on a QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) connected to a NanoAcquity™ Ultra Performance UPLC system (Waters, Milford MA).

### Data Protocol
Peak lists were generated using PAVA in-house software (Guan S, Price JC, Prusiner SB, Ghaemmaghami S, Burlingame AL. A data processing pipeline for mammalian proteome dynamics studies using stable isotope metabolic labeling. Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP. 2011;10(12):M111 010728) and searched against the human subset of the SwissProt database, (SwissProt.2015.12.1) (plus the corresponding randomized sequences to calculate FRD on the searches, and adding sequences for BioID when necessary), using Protein Prospector. 1% FDR were allowed on individual searches
