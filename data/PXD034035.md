### Title
Microbial Metaproteome from the Western Atlantic Ocean DeepDOM KN210-04 Expedition

### Description
This dataset consists of 20 metaproteomic analyses of the Western Atlantic Ocean aboard the R/V Knorr KN210-04 DeepDOM expedition in 2013. Samples were collected by McLane pumps on GFF or GF75 filters, split, and frozen until analyses. Expedition metadata and co-sampled datasets are available at: https://www.bco-dmo.org/deployment/59057

### Sample Protocol
Sample filters were extracted and trypsin digested using a modified magnetic bead method, followed by analysis using an 8 hour online two-dimension comprehensive active modulation RP-RP liquid chromatography separation coupled to a Thermo Fusion mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Peptide-to-spectrum mass spectra identifications were made using SEQUEST HT and a metagenome sequence database within Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.2 software using a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment tolerance of 0.6 Da. Processed files were then loaded into Scaffold 5.1 (Proteome Software Inc.) Metaproteomics peptide-to-spectrum identifications were made against a database created from metatranscriptomic analysis of the Western Atlantic Ocean DeepDOM KN210-04 Expedition transect.
