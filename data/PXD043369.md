### Title
AMBRA1 interactome in ATRT cellular Model

### Description
AMBRA1 interaction mapping in ATRT cellular model to identify potential interaction partners. BT12, BT16, CHLA06 and CHLA266 were used as cellular model. following AP data were analyzed using DIA-NN and interactions were scored against empty FLAG results.

### Sample Protocol
Affinity purififcation of AMBRA1 flag tagged protein and it's potentatial interactors from BT12, BT16, CHLA06 and CHLA266. As a control, empty FLAG was used to identify unspecific binding partners. Samples were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusin in DIA Mode (30 variable width windows.)

### Data Protocol
AP Samples were processed using DIA analysis in an Orbitrap Fusion. RAW data was analysed using DIA-NN in library free mode. Interactors were identified using one sided T-test against the empty FLAG (P<0.05)
