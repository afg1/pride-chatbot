### Title
TMT labeled Comparative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Active Immune Response during Clostridium perfringens type C Infected Piglet Diarrhea

### Description
We performed a TMT labeling-based quantitative spleen proteomic analysis of the control group (SC), tolerance group (SR) and susceptible group (SS) to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), and screened potential molecular markers of piglet spleen tissues in response to C. perfringens type C infection.

### Sample Protocol
Twenty-five piglets were randomly selected to suffer oral inoculate administration of 1 ×109 CFU/mL C. perfringens type C medium, the remaining 5 piglets were orally inoculated sterile medium as control group (SC), the experiment lasted for 5 days for the research report and the result of our pre-experiment. During the 5-day experimental period, all piglets were housed separately by special environmental control equipment, bodyweight, mental state, shape and color of feces and degree of diarrhea for each piglet were detailly observed and recorded detailly in every day. At the end of the test, the total diarrhea scores of each piglet were calculated by adding each defecation score of each piglet during the test period. Finally, 3 piglets with the highest and lowest total diarrhea scores were considered as the susceptible group (SS) and t the tolerance group (SR). In general, SS represents in sensitive to C. perfringens infection with serious diarrhea, and SR represents which resistant to C. perfringens infection with mild diarrhea.
