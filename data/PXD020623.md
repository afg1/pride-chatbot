### Title
AP-3 vesicles retain their coat and depend on the HOPS subunit Vps41 for tethering to vacuoles

### Description
Identification of Age2 as part of AP-3 vesicles using Turbo-ID

### Sample Protocol
Cells expressing Apl5-TurboID-V5 and wildtype cells were grown over night in YPD to an OD600 of 0.4. 100 µM Biotin were added, and cells were grown for another 3 hours to a final OD600 of 0.8 – 1. 750 OD600 equivalent units of cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min. Cells were washed two times with ddH2O, the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (2 M NaOH, 7.5 % β-Mercaptoethanol), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated with 22.5 % Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the pellet was washed three times with ice-cold acetone. Pellets were dried and incubated in resuspension buffer (4 M Urea, 0.5 % SDS, 10 mM DTT) until they were completely dissolved. Magnetic streptavidin beads were added to the suspension, and tubes were incubated on a turning wheel at RT for 1.5 hours. The beads were washed six times with washing buffer (0.5 % SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling beads in sample buffer at 99°C followed by rapid removal of the supernatants. Samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-gel for some minutes, and the top part of each lane was excised, and processed by in gel-digestion with LysC as described previously (Eising et al., 2019).

### Data Protocol
Peptides were separated by HPLC (Thermo Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano) on a 50 cm PepMap® C18 easy spray columns (Thermo) with an inner diameter of 75 µm at a constant temperature of 40°C. The column temperature was kept at 40 °C. Peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 10%–35% in 0.1% formic acid for 32 min at a constant flow rate of 250 nl/min. Peptides eluting from the column were directly electrosprayed into a Q ExactivePlus mass spectrometer (Thermo). Mass spectra were acquired on the Q ExactivePlus in a data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full MS scan and up to ten data-dependent MS/MS scans. The maximum injection time for full scans was 50 ms, with a target value of 3,000,000 at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z = 200. The ten most intense multiply charged ions (z=2) from the survey scan were selected with an isolation width of 1.6 Th and fragment with higher energy collision dissociation (Olsen et al., 2007) with normalized collision energies of 27. Target values for MS/MS were set at 100,000 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z = 200. To avoid repetitive sequencing, the dynamic exclusion of sequenced peptides was set at 20 s. The resulting MS and MS/MS spectra were analysed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.13, www .maxquant.org/; (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox et al., 2011) as described previously (Fröhlich et al., 2013). The search included carbamidomethlyation of cysteine as a fixed modification and methionine and lysine biotinylation (C10H14N2O2S; mass change 226.077598394) was added as a variable modification. The maximum allowed mass deviation was 6 ppm for MS peaks and 20 ppm for MS/MS peaks. The maximum number of missed cleavages was three, due to potential missed cleavages caused by biotinylated lysines. The false discovery rate was determined by searching a reverse database. The maximum false discovery rate was 0.01 on both the peptide and the protein level. The minimum required peptide length was six residues. All experiments were performed in triplicates and analyzed using the label free quantification option of MaxQuant (Cox et al., 2014). Calculations and plots were performed with the R software package (www.r-project.org/; RRID:SCR_001905) following available label free quantification scripts (Hubner et al., 2010).

### Publication Abstract
Heterotetrameric adapter (AP) complexes cooperate with the small GTPase Arf1 or lipids in cargo selection, vesicle formation, and budding at endomembranes in eukaryotic cells. While most AP complexes also require clathrin as the outer vesicle shell, formation of AP-3-coated vesicles involved in Golgi-to-vacuole transport in yeast has been postulated to depend on Vps41, a subunit of the vacuolar HOPS tethering complex. HOPS has also been identified as the tether of AP-3 vesicles on vacuoles. To unravel this conundrum of a dual Vps41 function, we anchored Vps41 stably to the mitochondrial outer membrane. By monitoring AP-3 recruitment, we now show that Vps41 can tether AP-3 vesicles to mitochondria, yet AP-3 vesicles can form in the absence of Vps41 or clathrin. By proximity labeling and mass spectrometry, we identify the Arf1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Age2 at the AP-3 coat and show that tethering, but not fusion at the vacuole can occur without complete uncoating. We conclude that AP-3 vesicles retain their coat after budding and that their complete uncoating occurs only after tethering at the vacuole.
