### Title
In-depth and reproducibly quantitation of benchmark dataset consiting of 20 files

### Description
We prepared a benchmark dataset where the various levels of spikeed-in E. Coli proteome that true fold change (i.e. 1 fold, 1.5 fold, 2 fold, 2.5 fold and 3 fold) and true identities of positives/negatives (i.e. E.Coli proteins are true positives while Human proteins are true negatives) are known. To best mimic the proteomics application in comparison of multiple replicates, each fold change

### Sample Protocol
We prepared a set of spike-in samples by spiking E.Coli proteome(at small portions, representing altered proteins) into human proteome(large portion, representing unchanged background proteins). DH5α E. Coli lysate were spiked in human pancreatic cancer cells(Panc-1) lysate at five different levels: 1 fold(2% E.Coli), 1.5 fold(3% E.Coli), 2 fold(4% E.Coli), 2.5 fold(5% E.Coli) and 3 fold(6% E.Coli). The mixed samples were alkylated, precipitated and digested.4 µL of samples containing 2 µg peptides were loaded onto a reversed-

### Data Protocol
Database searching: MS GF+ searching using concatenated human and E.Coli database; Searching result merging: Scaffold 4.0. Identification criteria: <1% Protein FDR and Pepetide FDR with at leat 2 unique peptides. Quantitation: IonStar(SIEVE+IonStar-processing

### Publication Abstract
In-depth and reproducible protein measurement in many biological samples is often critical for pharmaceutical/biomedical proteomics but remains challenging. MS1-based quantification using quadrupole/ultrahigh-field Orbitrap (Q/UHF-Orbitrap) holds great promise, but the critically important experimental approaches enabling reliable large-cohort analysis have long been overlooked. Here we described an IonStar experimental strategy achieving excellent quantitative quality of MS1 quantification. Key features include: (i) an optimized, surfactant-aided sample preparation approach provides highly efficient (&gt;75% recovery) and reproducible (&lt;15% CV) peptide recovery across large cell/tissue cohorts; (ii) a long column with modest gradient length (2.5 h) yields the optimal balance of depth/throughput on a Q/UHF-Orbitrap; (iii) a large-ID trap not only enables highly reproducible gradient delivery as for the first time observed via real-time conductivity monitoring, but also increases quantitative loading capacity by &gt;8-fold and quantified &gt;25% more proteins; (iv) an optimized HCD-OT markedly outperforms HCD-IT when analyzing large cohorts with high loading amounts; (v) selective removal of hydrophobic/hydrophilic matrix components using a novel selective trapping/delivery approach enables reproducible, robust LC-MS analysis of &gt;100 biological samples in a single set, eliminating batch effect; (vi) MS1 acquired at higher resolution (fwhm = 120 k) provides enhanced S/N and quantitative accuracy/precision for low-abundance species. We examined this pipeline by analyzing a 5 group, 20 samples biological benchmark sample set, and quantified 6273 unique proteins (&#x2265;2 peptides/protein) under stringent cutoffs without fractionation, 6234 (&gt;99.4%) without missing data in any of the 20 samples. The strategy achieved high quantitative accuracy (3-6% media error), low intragroup variation (6-9% media intragroup CV) and low false-positive biomarker discovery rates (3-8%) across the five groups, with quantified protein abundances spanning &gt;6.5 orders of magnitude. Finally, this strategy is straightforward, robust, and broadly applicable in pharmaceutical/biomedical investigations.
