### Title
Signaling proteins of a chemosensory pathway from sperm of Arbacia punctulata

### Description
Cilia and flagella serve as cellular antennae that translate sensory information into cellular responses. In sperm, a single chemoattractant molecule triggers signaling events that evoke a Ca2+ response and chemotactic steering. Key components of the chemotactic signaling pathway from sperm of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata were investigated. Shotgun proteomics employing SDS-PAGE LC-MS/MS and MudPIT provided the proteome inventory of sperm flagella.

### Sample Protocol
The collection of A. punctulata sperm and the preparation of flagella were as described in Seifert et al. (EMBO J, 2015).
For MudPIT, flagella were washed twice with 0.1 M (NH4)2CO3 and sedimented by ultracentrifugation (100,000 x g, 30 min, 4°C). Membrane pellets were resuspended, sonicated, and processed by tryptic in‐solution digestion in a methanol and NH4HCO3 buffer (Fischer and Poetsch, MCP, 2006). After removal of membranes by ultracentrifugation, samples were desalted using Spec PT C18 AR tips (Varian). 
For GeLC-MS, 45 µg flagella protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie G-250, then destained with acetic acid and the separation gel divided into 12 pieces. Each piece was cut into gel cubes and digested (Pichlo et al., J.Cell Biol. 2014 ) with 6.25 ng µl-1 trypsin in a NH4HCO3 buffer (20 mM at pH 8.6).


### Data Protocol
Spectra obtained from GeLC-MS and MudPIT were searched against the latest target sequences (to be published) using SEQUEST algorithm, embedded in Proteome DiscovererTM (Rev. 1.4.1.14, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Search parameters were as described in Seifert et al. (EMBO J, 2015).

### Publication Abstract
Cilia serve as cellular antennae that translate sensory information into physiological responses. In the sperm flagellum, a single chemoattractant molecule can trigger a Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise that controls motility. The mechanisms underlying such ultra-sensitivity are ill-defined. Here, we determine by mass spectrometry the copy number of nineteen chemosensory signaling proteins in sperm flagella from the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata. Proteins are up to 1,000-fold more abundant than the free cellular messengers cAMP, cGMP, H<sup>+</sup> , and Ca<sup>2+</sup> . Opto-chemical techniques show that high protein concentrations kinetically compartmentalize the flagellum: Within milliseconds, cGMP is relayed from the receptor guanylate cyclase to a cGMP-gated channel that serves as a perfect chemo-electrical transducer. cGMP is rapidly hydrolyzed, possibly via "substrate channeling" from the channel to the phosphodiesterase PDE5. The channel/PDE5 tandem encodes cGMP turnover rates rather than concentrations. The rate-detection mechanism allows continuous stimulus sampling over a wide dynamic range. The textbook notion of signal amplification-few enzyme molecules process many messenger molecules-does not hold for sperm flagella. Instead, high protein concentrations ascertain messenger detection. Similar mechanisms may occur in other small compartments like primary cilia or dendritic spines.
