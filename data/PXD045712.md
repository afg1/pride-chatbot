### Title
Chemoproteomics-guided development of SLC15A4 inhibitors with anti-inflammatory activity

### Description
SLC15A4 is an endolysosome-resident transporter intimately linked with autoinflammation and autoimmunity. Specifically, SLC15A4 is critical for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7-9 as well as the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) signaling in several immune cell subsets. Notably, SLC15A4 is essential for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus in murine models and is associated with autoimmune conditions in humans. Despite its therapeutic potential, to our knowledge no chemical probes have been developed that target SLC15A4. Here, we use an integrated chemical proteomics approach to develop a suite of chemical tools, including first-in-class functional inhibitors, for SLC15A4. We demonstrate SLC15A4 inhibitors described herein suppress endolysosomal TLR and NOD functions in a variety of human and mouse immune cells, furnish evidence of their ability to suppress inflammation in vivo and in clinical settings, and provide insights into their mechanism of action. Our findings establish SLC15A4 as a druggable target for the treatment of autoimmune/autoinflammatory conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µL ice-cold DPBS containing 1X Halt protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific), lysed via sonication and proteins were quantified as described above. 100 - 200 µg protein per sample was aliquoted to tubes containing urea (8 M final concentration) and proteins were reduced (with TCEP and K2CO3) and alkylated (with IAA) as described above. Proteins were then precipitated with 1.2 ml ice-cold 4:1 MeOH/CHCl3 followed by 600 µL ice-cold DPBS. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged (12,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min), forming a disk, and the supernatant was removed. Proteins were then washed with 600 µL ice-cold 4:1 MeOH/CHCl3, re-centrifuged and the supernatant was again removed. Protein pellets were resuspended in 160 µL 100 mM TEAB via sonication and endopeptidase LysC (NEB) was added at a ratio of 1:100 with protein amount. The LysC digest was conducted for 2 hrs, after which sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, 1:100 with protein amount), ProteaseMAX (Promega, 0.05% final concentration), and CaCl2 (1 mM final concentration) were added, and the digestion was allowed to proceed overnight. Following the digest, samples were centrifuged (12,000 x g, 4 °C, 5 min) and digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Fluorometric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 25 µg from each sample was aliquoted, desalted with C18 spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and labeled with TMT10plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. TMT-labeled peptides were combined in 0.1% TFA as described above and fractionated with the Pierce high pH Reversed-Phase Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide fractions were eluted from the spin column with solutions of 0.1% triethylamine containing an increasing concentration of MeCN (7.5 - 75% MeCN; 18 fractions). The fractions were combined into 9 final fractions in a pairwise fashion (fraction 1 and fraction 7, fraction 2 and fraction 8, etc.), dried via vacuum centrifugation, and stored at -80 °C until ready for mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
TMT labeled peptides were resuspended in MS buffer A (20 µL, 0.1% formic acid in water) prior to LC-MS analysis. 3 µL of each sample was loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 precolumn (75 µm x 2 mm) and eluted on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical column (75 µm x 15 cm) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Buffer A was prepared as described above and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in MeCN) were used in a 220 min gradient (flow rate 0.3 mL/min, 35 °C) of 2% buffer B for 10 min, followed by an incremental increase to 30% buffer B over 192 min, 60% buffer B for 5 min, 60-95% buffer B for 1 min, hold at 95% buffer B for 5 min, followed by descent to 2% buffer B for 1 min followed by re-equilibration at 2% buffer B for 6 min. The eluents were analyzed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with a cycle time of 3 sec and nano-LC electrospray ionization source applied voltage of 2.0 kV. MS1 spectra were recorded at a resolution of 120,000 with an automatic gain control (AGC) value of 1x106 ions, maximum injection time of 50 msec (dynamic exclusion enabled, repeat count 1, duration 20 sec). The scan range was specified from 375 to 1,500 m/z. Peptides selected for MS2 analysis were isolated with the quadrupole (isolation window 1.6 m/z) and fragmented using collision-induced dissociation (CID 30%) with resultant fragments recorded in the ion trap (AGC 1.8x104, maximum inject time 120 msec). A list of TMT 10plex-labeled SLC15A4 peptide molecular weights (573.6666, 872.9958, 463.8029, 688,3862, 1239.1694, 1012.5444, 705.4477, 459.2593, 582.3318, 859.9966, 517.7844, 721.8893, 470.6345, 675.3653) were employed for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MS3 spectra were generated by high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with collision energy of 65%. Synchronous precursor selection43 (SPS) was employed to isolate up to 10 MS2 ions for MS3 analysis to improve sensitivity of MS3-based quantitation.
