### Title
Mass spectrometry analysis of the neutrophil secretome (Gelatinase/Specific granules)

### Description
Mass spectrometry analysis of the secretome of wild-type and Wash-cKO Washc1haemo) neutrophils treated with fMLF that favors Gelatinase/Specific granule secretion over azurophilic granule secretion.

### Sample Protocol
Proteomics analysis was performed at the Scripps Research Institute proteomics core facility. Briefly, proteins were solubilized in 0.2% Rapigest (Waters Corportation) and reduced in 5 mM D,L-dithiothrietol (Sigma) for 30 minutes followed by alkylation with 15 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 minutes in the dark. Proteins were digested with trypsin at 37°C using a 1:30 (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio. Peptides were analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography before mass spectrometry analysis using the following method. Nanoelectrospray capillary column tips were made in-house by using a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments). The columns were packed with Zorbax SB-C18 stationary phase (Agilent) purchased in bulk (5-Micron particles, with a 15-cm length and a 75-mm inner diameter). The reverse-phase gradient separation was performed by using water and acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phases. The gradient consisted of 5% acetonitrile for 10 min followed by a gradient to 8% acetonitrile for 5 min, 35% acetonitrile for 113 min, 55% acetonitrile for 12 min, 95% acetonitrile for 15 min, and re-equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile for 15 min.

### Data Protocol
Data-dependent MS/MS data were obtained with an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer using a home-built nanoelectrospray source at 2 kV at the tip. One MS spectrum was followed by 3 MS/MS scans on the most abundant ions after the application of the dynamic exclusion list.All MS/MS data samples were searched against the NCBI Mus musculus (house mouse) database using Mascot (version 2.3.02; Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom). Mascot searches were conducted using a peptide mass tolerance of 2.0 Da, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da, fixed modifications of carbamidomethylation (C), variable modifications of oxidation (M), an enzyme of trypsin and a maximum of one missed cleavage. Proteins with a P < 0.05 (corresponding to a Mascot ion score greater than 45) were identified with two or more peptides and considered at the 95% confidence level.

### Publication Abstract
Dysregulated secretion in neutrophil leukocytes associates with human inflammatory disease. The exocytosis response to triggering stimuli is sequential; gelatinase granules modulate the initiation of the innate immune response, followed by the release of pro-inflammatory azurophilic granules, requiring stronger stimulation. Exocytosis requires actin depolymerization which is actively counteracted under non-stimulatory conditions. Here we show that the actin nucleator, WASH, is necessary to maintain azurophilic granules in their refractory state by granule actin entrapment and interference with the Rab27a-JFC1 exocytic machinery. On the contrary, gelatinase granules of WASH-deficient neutrophil leukocytes are characterized by decreased Rac1, shortened granule-associated actin comets and impaired exocytosis. Rac1 activation restores exocytosis of these granules. In vivo, WASH deficiency induces exacerbated azurophilic granule exocytosis, inflammation, and decreased survival. WASH deficiency thus differentially impacts neutrophil granule subtypes, impairing exocytosis of granules that mediate the initiation of the neutrophil innate response while exacerbating pro-inflammatory granule secretion.
