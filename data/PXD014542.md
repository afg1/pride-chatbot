### Title
Comparative iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of shrimp infected with the isopod

### Description
Although parasitic isopods can negatively affect the reproduction and ingestion of several commercially important crustaceans, little is known regarding the mechanisms that underlie these effects.

### Sample Protocol
In the present study, the iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) approach was applied to identify differentially expressed proteins in the Chinese grass shrimp Palaemonetes sinensis infected with the parasitic isopod Tachaea chinensis.

### Data Protocol
The raw files were analyzed by using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, BW, Germany). Identification of the proteins was conducted using the MASCOT V2.2 search engine (Matrix Science Ltd., London, U.K.). The protein identification and quantitation parameters are shown in Table 1. Differential proteins were analyzed for significant down- or upregulation, which was calculated using Protein Pilot. The values of the intensities of the three reporter ions for each experimental group were averaged and then the difference was statistically assessed. The fold change was set to >1.2 for protein upregulation and <0.83 for protein downregulation.
