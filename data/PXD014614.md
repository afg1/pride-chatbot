### Title
Peptidomic analysis of Burkholderia Cenocepacia strains

### Description
Comparsion of the endogenous peptide pool within Burkholderia Cenocepacia strains to identify evidence for glycoprotein degradation in the absent of glycosylation. WT vs delta pglL vs pglL complement were compared (4 biological of each)

### Sample Protocol
Freshly prepared whole cell pellets were solubilized in gdm lysis buffer (6M gdm, 50mM HEPES, 10mM TCEP, 40mM CAA) by boiling and protein precipated with 20% TCA on ice for three hours. Samples were spun down and the resulting supernatant was collected and clean up with tC18 columns. Peptides were eluted with 50% ACN, 0.1% FA and dried down.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched using Maxquant version 1.5.3.30 using unspecific specifcity, and allowing oxidation of Methionine as well as Burkholderia glycans. Matching between runs and LFQ based quantification was enabled
