### Title
Proteomic analysis reveals the protective effects of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection on chronic heart failure by improving myocardial energy metabolism

### Description
Animal model establishment，issue protein extraction，HPLC extraction，LC-MS/MS analysis。database search

### Sample Protocol
All frozen samples were took out and ground them with liquid nitrogen. Then the same amount of samples was transferred to MP shaker tubes, and moderate dose of protein lysis solution (1% SDS + 8 M urea, containing protease inhibitors) was added. FastPrep®-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals, OH, USA) was used to homogenize heart tissue samples in pyrolysis buffer (TEAB, 25 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)).

### Data Protocol
The software version used by the database was Proteome DiscovererTM Software 2.2.
