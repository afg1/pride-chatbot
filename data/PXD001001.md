### Title
A substrate trapping approach identifies proteins regulated by reversible S-nitrosylation

### Description
In this study we adapted the Trx trapping strategy for global profiling of cellular nitrosylation/denitrosylation processes. Using this approach, we report the identification of hundreds of potential new nitrosylated targets in monoctyes and macrophages followed by validation using biochemical and functional assays.

### Sample Protocol
Our approach is based on nitrosothiol capture and enrichment using a thioredoxin trap mutant followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. We identified specific proteins captured by Trx(C35S) by coupling the trapping protocol with mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis. Two biological replicates of enriched proteins were in-gel digested and analyzed using a capillary LC-MSMS using the Orbitrap mass spectrometer platform.

### Data Protocol
Identification and quantitative analysis was performed using the MaxQuant software.

### Publication Abstract
Protein S-nitrosylation, the nitric oxide-mediated posttranslational modification of cysteine residues, has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism in diverse cellular processes. Yet, knowledge about the S-nitrosoproteome in different cell types and cellular contexts is still limited and many questions remain regarding the precise roles of protein S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation. Here we present a novel strategy to identify reversibly nitrosylated proteins. Our approach is based on nitrosothiol capture and enrichment using a thioredoxin trap mutant, followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. Employing this approach, we identified more than 400 putative nitroso-proteins in S-nitrosocysteine-treated human monocytes and about 200 nitrosylation substrates in endotoxin and cytokine-stimulated mouse macrophages. The large majority of these represent novel nitrosylation targets and they include many proteins with key functions in cellular homeostasis and signaling. Biochemical and functional experiments in vitro and in cells validated the proteomic results and further suggested a role for thioredoxin in the denitrosylation and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the protein kinase MEK1. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the macrophage S-nitrosoproteome and the role of thioredoxin-mediated denitrosylation in nitric oxide signaling. The approach described here may prove generally useful for the identification and exploration of nitroso-proteomes under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
