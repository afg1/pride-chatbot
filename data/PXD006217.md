### Title
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography for bottom-up proteomics

### Description
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography as a first dimension to reduce samples complexity for bottom-up proteomics analyses of single proteins and protein complexes

### Sample Protocol
HIC followed by filter-aided in-solution digests of single fractions; peptide analysis by RPC-MS/MS using a Easy-LC coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap; HIC-based workflow is compared to a classical gel-based approach

### Data Protocol
Data processed by MaxQuant version 1.4.1.2 using a Uniprot human full length database from March 2016

### Publication Abstract
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) is a robust standard analytical method to purify proteins while preserving their biological activity. It is widely used to study post-translational modifications of proteins and drug-protein interactions. In the current manuscript we employed HIC to separate proteins, followed by bottom-up LC-MS/MS experiments. We used this approach to fractionate antibody species followed by comprehensive peptide mapping as well as to study protein complexes in human cells. HIC-reversed-phase chromatography (RPC)-mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful alternative to fractionate proteins for bottom-up proteomics experiments making use of their distinct hydrophobic properties.
