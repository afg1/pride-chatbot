### Title
Mice brain tissue IP experiment

### Description
This is a experment want to fish out the proteins in the mice brain can interact with sodium chanel protein Nav1.7, immuno precipatation and lab free mass spectrmetry were used to identify Nav1.7 Interation parter proteins.

### Sample Protocol
Using gene targeting technique, we generated an epitope tagged NaV1.7 mice showed normal NaV1.7 expression pattern and normal pain behaviors. Analysis of NaV1.7 complexes affinity purified under native conditions by mass spectrometry revealed 268 NaV1.7 associated proteins.

### Data Protocol
All trypsin fragments were added to an exclusion list. False discovery rate was calculated by peptide/proteinprophet or estimated empirically from decoy hits, identified proteins were filtered to an estimated 1% FDR. The label-free analysis was carried out using the normalized spectral index (SINQ).
