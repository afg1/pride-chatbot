### Title
The protein profile of mammary gland and tumors between Brca1-WT and MT miece by DIA-MS(DIA-data)

### Description
WT mammary gland(WTMG),mutant-MG(MTMG),WT breast tumors(WTBT),MTBT and MTBT-adjacent MG were collected to do data-independent acquisiton(DIA)mass to find the intrinsic factors that is associated with Brca1-deficiency induced breast cancer.

### Sample Protocol
WT mammary gland(WTMG),mutant-MG(MTMG),WT breast tumors(WTBT),MTBT and MTBT-adjacent MG were collected to do data-independent acquisiton(DIA)mass.

### Data Protocol
The DDA data were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.4 Thermo Scientific). Raw data of DIA were processed and analyzed by Spectronaut.
