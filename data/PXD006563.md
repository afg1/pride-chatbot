### Title
Analysis of extracellular matrix proteins from 3D cultures of primary prostate fibroblasts, DU145 cells and mixed cells

### Description
Composition and organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor stroma are important regulators of cancer cell behavior. Therefore, ECM produced by cancer associated fibroblasts is often used in in vitro experiments. Here, a proteome wide analysis of ECM proteins in 3D culture is analysed.

### Sample Protocol
The proteins from 3D cultures were reduced, alkylated, and digested with LysC/Trypsin mixture (Promega), first for 4 h in 8 M / 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, then for 16 h after dilution to 0.8 M urea with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and subsequently filtrated by a Microcon ultrafiltration device with 10 kDa cutoff (Merck-Millipore). The peptides were desalted by StageTips and loaded on a nanoflow HPLC system (Easy-nLCII, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the Orbitrap Velos Pro Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap or QExactive (for 3D culture samples) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. Three repeated runs per sample were performed.

### Data Protocol
The tandem mass spectra obtained from 3D culture samples were analyzed by MaxQuant software using SwissProt entries in the UniprotKB database (release 2015_08) Carbamidomethyl (C) as a fixed modification and oxidation (M, P, K) as dynamic modifications were set. Label-free quantitation with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“match between runsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option selected was performed.
