### Title
Rapid and specific degradation of endogenous proteins in mouse models using auxin-inducible degrons

### Description
Auxin-inducible degrons are a chemical genetic tool for targeted protein degradation and are widely used to study protein function in cultured mammalian cells. Here, we develop CRISPR-engineered mouse lines that enable rapid and highly specific degradation of tagged endogenous proteins in vivo. Most but not all cell types are competent for degradation. Using mouse genetics, we show that degradation kinetics depend upon the dose of the tagged protein, ligand, and the E3 ligase subunit Tir1. Rapid degradation of condensin I and condensin II – two essential regulators of mitotic chromosome structure - revealed that both complexes are individually required for cell division in precursor lymphocytes, but not in their differentiated peripheral lymphocyte derivatives. This generalisable approach provides unprecedented temporal control over the dose of endogenous proteins in mouse models, with implications for studying essential biological pathways and modelling drug activity in mammalian tissues.

### Sample Protocol
Mice were treated with 100mg/kg auxin via intraperitoneal injection for 2 hours, then culled by cervical dislocation. Thymus was removed and a single cell suspension of primary thymocytes was made using ice-cold PBS. CD8a+ cells were isolated by MACS using CD8a2 (Ly-2) microbeads (Miltenyi) following manufacturer instructions. Purified cells were lysed in whole proteome lysis buffer (6M GuHCl, 100mM TrisHCl 8.5, 1mg/mL Chloracetamide, 1.5mg/mL TCEP) at a concentration of 0.3×106 cells/μL buffer. Lysate was sonicated with a probe sonicator (Soniprep 150) until no longer viscous, and boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes. Supernatent was then transferred to a fresh tube and processed for Mass spectrometry.  A 50uL volume of sample was heated to 97°C for 5 minutes, then pre-digest (Lys-C, Fujifilm WakoPure Chemical Corporation) was added (1μL/sample) and samples incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. Samples were diluted 1/5 by addition of 200uL Mass Spec grade water, and 1ug trypsin (Fujifilm WakoPure Chemical Corporation) was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at 37°C with hard shaking overnight.  Samples were acidified with 1% TFA and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, for 10 minutes at room temperature. Sample was applied to a double layer Empore C18 Extraction Disk (3M) prepared with methanol. Membrane was washed twice with 0.1% TFA and protein was eluted with elution buffer (50% ACN, 0.05% TFA), dried using a CentriVap Concentrator (Labconco) and resuspended in 15uL 0.1% TFA. Protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280nm on a Nanodrop 1000, then 2 μg of de-salted peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm emitter packed with 1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur 200 C18-AQ (Dr Maisch, Germany) using a RSLC-nano uHPLC systems connected to a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (both Thermo, UK). Peptides were separated by a 140 min linear gradient from 5% to 30% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in DIA mode, acquiring a MS 350-1650 Da at 120k resolution followed by MS/MS on 45 windows with 0.5 Da overlap (200-2000 Da) at 30k with a NCE setting of 27.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed and quantified using Spectronaut 15 (Biognosis, Switzerland) using directDIA against the Uniprot Mus Musculus database with the default settings. Ratios and statistical tests were determined by the Spectronaut pipeline using default settings.
