### Title
Metabolic Glycan Labelling or not (MGL/non-MGL) A375 cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) Proteomics data file for comparing the difference of EV proteins before and after MGL

### Description
This project including the results of protein identification file and six samples’ Raw file that were non-processed

### Sample Protocol
MGL- EVs or non-MGL- EVs from A375 cells were prepared as described in the section of “EV isolation from cell culture media”. About 50 μg EVs were incubated in the freshly prepared lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris buffer with 8 M urea, pH 8.0) on ice for 20 min. Then the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. The lysate was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C until measurement by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASY-IC ion source (Thermo Scientific Inc, US) and the raw data was analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific Inc, US) against uniprot database, and gene ontology analysis was analyzed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp).
