### Title
Proteomes of Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 and its Pf1 sRNA mutant at 4/32℃

### Description
To understand the functions of Pf1 sRNA in response to temperature changes, a knockout mutant (ΔPf1) was constructed. Transcriptomics and proteomics were performed on biological triplicates of the wild strain and ΔPf1 grown to stationary phase at 4°C and 32°C. The file uploaded is the original data of proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
To perform proteomic analysis, triplicates of BSW20308 and ΔPf1 were grown to stationary phase at 4°C and 32°C. Proteins were extracted using acetone precipitation and quantified using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) approach at BGI Genomics Co., Ltd. China.

### Data Protocol
Proteins with a log2 fold-change ≥1 or ≤ ‒1 and a P-value (Padj) ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed.
