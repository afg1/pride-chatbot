### Title
Proteomic analysis of exported chaperone/coÔºçchaperone complexes of P. falciparum reveals an array of complex protein-protein interactions

### Description
Project describe: The P. falciparum export 300-400 proteins during infect human red blood cell, where they are involved in host cell modification including We recently identified a novel structure in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes which we refer to as J-dots. These structures contain exported parasite-encoded Hsp40s and are implicated in protein transport through the erythrocyte. This project wants isolation and proteomic characterisation of parasite-induced intra-erythrocytic structure to understand their importance in parasite survival and virulence. A more thorough understanding of this novel process may eventually lead to new avenues for therapy.

### Sample Protocol
P. falciparum  infected red blood cell  were enriched followed by cross-linked , cell  lysed and the supernatant were performed co- immunoprecipitated by using anti-GFP/antiHsp70x .Elution binding Protein were separated on a 12% SDS-Page gel followed by in gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
Digested peptides were analyzed via LTQ-Orbitrap Elite Mass spectrometry (Thermo Fisher) equipped EASY-Spray source and nano-LC UltiMate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography system. A full-scan survey MS experiment (m/z range from 375 to 1600; automatic gain control target, 1,000,000 ions; resolution at 400 m/z, 60,000; maximum ion accumulation time, 50 ms) was performed using the Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Raw data were converted to mgf files by Proteome Discoverer 1.3, and then identified using pFind 2.1 software to search in the human Uniprot_TrEMBL database and plasmodium DB database . The modification was set as follows: static modification of carbamidomethyl (Cys), dynamic modification of deamination (Asn), oxidation (Met), and acetylation (Lys). Trypsin was selected as the enzyme, and two missed cleavages were allowed. The mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the precursor ions and 0.5 Da for the fragment ions. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was estimated and applied to all data sets at the total peptide level.

### Publication Abstract
Malaria parasites modify their human host cell, the mature erythrocyte. This modification is mediated by a large number of parasite proteins that are exported to the host cell, and is also the underlying cause for the pathology caused by malaria infection. Amongst these proteins are many Hsp40 co-chaperones, and a single Hsp70. These proteins have been implicated in several processes in the host cell, including a potential role in protein transport, however the further molecular players in this process remain obscure. To address this, we have utilized chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting to isolate and characterize proteins complexes containing an exported Hsp40 (PFE55), and the only known exported Hsp70 (PfHsp70x). Our data reveal that both of these proteins are contained in high molecular weight protein complexes. These complexes are found both in the infected erythrocyte, and within the parasite-derived compartment referred to as the parasitophorous vacuole. Surprisingly, our data also reveal an association of PfHsp70x with components of PTEX, a putative protein translocon within the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole. Our results suggest that the P. falciparum- infected human erythrocyte contains numerous high molecular weight protein complexes, which may potentially be involved in host cell modification.
