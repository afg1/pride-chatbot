### Title
Quantification of sulfenic acid modification in an atherosclerosis

### Description
Physiological stimuli such as thrombin, or pathological stimuli such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), activate platelets. The activated platelets bind to monocytes through P-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions, but also release the contents of their granules, commonly called “platelet releasate”. It is known that monocytes in contact with platelet releasate produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reversible cysteine oxidation by ROS is considered to be a potential regulator of protein function. In a previous study, we used THP-1 monocytic cells exposed to LPA- or thrombin-induced platelet releasate and a modified biotin switch assay to unravel the biological processes that are influenced by reversible cysteine oxidation. To gain a better understanding of the redox regulation of monocytes in atherosclerosis, we have now altered the modified biotin switch to selectively quantify protein sulfenic acid, a subpopulation of reversible cysteine oxidation. Using arsenite as reducing agent in the modified biotin switch assay, we were able to quantify 1161 proteins, in which more than 100 sulfenic acid sites were identified. Bioinformatics analysis of the quantified sulfenic acid sites highlighted the relevant, previously missed biological process of monocyte transendothelial migration, which included integrin β2. Flow cytometry validated the activation of LFA-1 (αLβ2) and Mac-1 (αMβ2), two subfamilies of integrin β2 complexes, on human primary monocytes following platelet releasate treatment. The activation of LFA-1 was mediated by ROS from NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation. Production of ROS and activation of LFA-1 in human primary monocytes were independent of P-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction. Our results proved the modified biotin switch assay to be a powerful tool with the ability to reveal new regulatory mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.

### Sample Protocol
For NOX inhibitor experiments, heavy-isotope-labeled THP-1 cells were incubated with 10 µM DPI, and light-isotope-labeled THP-1 cells were treated with DMSO as the vehicle control for one hour. After that, 6-hour incubation with LPA or thrombin-induced platelet releasate was performed, and sulfenic acid modifications were enriched by the modified biotin switch assay. After treatment, light- and heavy-labeled THP-1 cells were washed twice with PBS, and harvested in lysis buffer in the presence of an equal amount of NEM (1:1, w/w) to block free thiols, and excess NEM was removed by buffer exchange using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units with 10 kDa cutoff. Sulfenic acids were then reduced by adding 200 mM arsenite, the reduced free thiols labeled with 1 mM biotin-maleimide for two hours at 37°C, and the labeled proteins enriched with NeutroAvidin. Enriched labeled proteins were eluted by boiling in 4 × SDS buffer (composition) and 1mM biotin for five minutes and loaded onto 10% SDS gel. Following electrophoretic separation, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and each lane was cut into five bands. In-gel digestion was performed essentially as described previously.13 The gel pieces were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol at 56°C for 30 minutes, followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 45 minutes. Trypsin digestion was performed in 50 mM NH4HCO3 at 37°C for at least 16 hours. Then, peptides were extracted from the gel pieces by adding extraction buffer (1:2 (v/v) 5% formic acid / acetonitrile). Samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a Bruker Impact Q-TOF.

### Data Protocol
Analysis of Q-TOF data was performed using MaxQuant 1.5.2.815. The data were searched against a database comprised of the protein sequences from human using the following parameters: peptide mass accuracy 20 ppm for the first search and 10 ppm for the second search; double SILAC as quantitation method. All other parameters were used as preset: trypsin enzyme specificity, variable modifications: biotin-maleimide, N-ethylmaleimide and carbamidomethyl on cysteine, oxidation on methionine. Only peptides and proteins with 99% confidence limit (1% false discovery rate) were considered as accurately identified.
