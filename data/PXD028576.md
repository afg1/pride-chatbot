### Title
The Arabidopsis mature endosperm promotes seedling cuticle formation via release of sulfated peptides

### Description
In Arabidopsis mature seeds, the onset of the embryo-to-seedling transition is nonautonomously controlled, being blocked by endospermic abscisic acid (ABA) release under unfavorable conditions. Mature embryos lack an impermeable cuticle, unlike seedlings, consistent with their endospermic ABA uptake capability. Seedling cuticle formation occurs after germination rather than during embryogenesis. Mature endosperm removal prevents seedling cuticle formation and seed reconstitution by endosperm grafting onto embryos shows that the endosperm promotes seedling cuticle development. Grafting different endosperm and embryo mutant combinations, together with biochemical, microscopy and mass spectrometry approaches, reveals that endospermic release of Tyrosyl Sulfate Transferase (TPST)-sulfated CIF2 and PSY1 peptides promotes seedling cuticle development. Endosperm-deprived embryos produced nonviable seedlings bearing numerous developmental defects, in a manner unrelated to embryo nourishment, all restored by exogenously provided endosperm. Hence, seedling establishment is nonautonomous, requiring the mature endosperm.

### Sample Protocol
To assess whether the endosperm releases sulfate peptides involved in seedling cuticle formation, we cultured for 48h a monolayer of dissected mature endosperms from WT, psy1 and cif1/2 mutants. The seed coat along the embryonic axis (hypocotyl and radicle) was incised with a fine syringe needle. As this procedure may damage the embryo, the embryo was expelled from the seed by gently squeezing the surface of the seed using blunted forceps. Supernatant (culture medium) samples were filtered with Amicon Ultra-0.5ml 10k centrifugal units to separate proteins from peptides. Protein fractions were then recovered by inverse centrifugation for evaluation of leakage from endosperm tissues. Filters were subsequently washed with 80% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid and 80% methanol. Wash solutions were pooled with peptide eluates and dried for LC-MS/MS analyses. Peptide eluates were resuspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile, for mass spectrometry analyses. Samples were injected on an Ultimate RSLC 3000 nanoHPLC system interfaced to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. Peptides were loaded onto a trapping microcolumn Acclaim PepMap100 C18 (20 mm x 100 µm ID, 5 µm, 100Å, Thermo Scientific) before separation on a reversed-phase custom packed nanocolumn (75 µm ID × 40 cm, 1.8 µm particles, Reprosil Pur, Dr. Maisch). A flowrate of 0.25 µl/min was used with a gradient from 4 to 76% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid (total time: 65 min). Full survey scans were performed at a 120’000 resolution, and a top speed precursor selection strategy was applied to maximize acquisition of peptide tandem MS spectra with a maximum cycle time of 1.5s. HCD fragmentation mode was used at a normalized collision energy of 32%, with a precursor isolation window of 1.6 m/z, and MS/MS spectra were acquired at a 15’000 resolution in the orbitrap cell. Peptides selected for MS/MS were excluded from further fragmentation during 60s.

### Data Protocol
Signals corresponding to m/z of searched peptides were extracted in Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific, version 4.2) and compared between samples. PSY1 peptide identity was confirmed by comparing its MS/MS spectrum with an unglycosylated peptide standard. MS data were also analyzed using Mascot 2.7 (Matrix Science, London, UK) set up to search the reference proteome database of Arabidopsis thaliana ((www.uniprot.org, August 2020 version: 39’346 sequences). Mascot was searched with no enzyme definition, a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da. Sulfonation of tyrosine, oxidation and (tri)-arabinosylation of proline were specified in Mascot as variable modifications.
