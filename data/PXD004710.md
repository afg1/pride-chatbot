### Title
Online non-contiguous fractionating and concatenating device coupled to two dimensional reverse phase/reverse phase liquid chromatography system for efficient and comprehensive proteomic analyses

### Description
The goal of the project is development of an online two dimensional reverse phase/reverse phase liquid chromatography (2D-RP/RPLC) separation platform, employing an online non-contiguous fractionating and concatenating device (NCFC fractionator) in order to provide highly improve separation orthogonality of the two RPs, resulting in significant increase in peptide identification sensitivity compared with those of the conventional contiguous 2D-RP/RPLC method.

### Sample Protocol
Analytical Sample Protocol - Alkylation: Iodoacetamide, Proteolysis: Trypsin; Chromatography Protocol �� mRP Column length: 50 cm, Column inner diameter: 150 �겖m, Particle size: 3 �겖m; RPLC Column length: 150 cm, Column inner diameter: 75 �겖m, Particle size: 3 �겖m; RPLC Gradient length: 360 min, Injected: 20 �겖g; Mass Spectrometry Protocol �� Dissociation: HCD, Instrument: Thermo Q Exactive, MS1 resolution: 70000, MS2 resolution: 17500, Precursors: Top 10

### Data Protocol
MS data were analyzed using PE-MMR to assign accurate precursor mass to tandem MS data. The resultant MS/MS spectra were searched against a composite database of uniprot-human-reference (May, 2013; 90,219 entries) and 179 common contaminants in the target-decoy setting using MS-GF+ (v9387) search engine under the following condition: Semi tryptic, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification and oxidation of methionine as variable modification.. Filtered at 1% FDR.

### Publication Abstract
Proteomics aims to achieve complete profiling of the protein content and protein modifications in cells, tissues, and biofluids and to quantitatively determine changes in their abundances. This information serves to elucidate cellular processes and signaling pathways and to identify candidate protein biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. Analyses must therefore be both comprehensive and efficient. Here, we present a novel online two-dimensional reverse-phase/reverse-phase liquid chromatography separation platform, which is based on a newly developed online noncontiguous fractionating and concatenating device (NCFC fractionator). In bottom-up proteomics analyses of a complex proteome, this system provided significantly improved exploitation of the separation space of the two RPs, considerably increasing the numbers of peptides identified compared to a contiguous 2D-RP/RPLC method. The fully automated online 2D-NCFC-RP/RPLC system bypassed a number of labor-intensive manual processes required with the previously described offline 2D-NCFC RP/RPLC method, and thus, it offers minimal sample loss in a context of highly reproducible 2D-RP/RPLC experiments.
