### Title
Protein lysine modification by a 3-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione probe and LC-MS/MS detection

### Description
Protein lysine modification in human plasma by a 3-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione probe and LC-MS/MS detection of binding sites.

### Sample Protocol
Protein labeling and click chemistry A freshly made stock solution of 200 mM alkyne-tagged 3-hydroxy-2,5-hexanedione (alk-3-HHD) in water was added to 500 µL samples of freshly drawn blood for final solutions of 0 (control), 0.25, 1 and 5 mM alk-3-HHD,  in triplicates. The Samples were incubated for 6 h at 37o  C, then centrifuged (5000 g, 5 min, rt) to isolate the plasma. 200 µL plasma was precipitated by addition of 1300 µL MeOH followed by overnight incubation at -20 C and centrifugation (10000 g, 5 min, 4 C). Protein pellets were dissolved using sonication in 1 mL 1% SDS in PBS, follow ed by addition of then added 20 µL  5 mM azido-azo-biotin, 100 µL of a 3:7 mixture of 50 mM CuSO4 and 100 mM THPTA and 50 µL 100 mM α-aminoguanidine. The samples were vortexed and the click reaction then initiated by addition of 50 µL freshly prepared 100 mM sodium ascorbate and vortexed again. Samples were reacted for 1 h at rt on a nutating mixer, then added 50 µL 0.5 M EDTA and vortexed. The proteins were precipitated using Wessel-Flügge MeOH/CHCl3 precipitation and the pellets were washed twice in 90% MeOH, then air dried for 20 min and dissolved in 400 µL 6 M urea.  Trypsin digestion Cysteines were reduced and alkylated by incubating with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at rt, then 28 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark, and quenched by another addition of 10 mM DTT. Samples were diluted to 1200 µL with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and added 3 µL 200 mM CaCl2 and 42 µL of a 10 mµg/mµL trypsin solution, then incubated overnight at 37 C.  Enrichment and release of peptides 100 µL of a 50% suspension of streptavidin agarose beads was then added directly to the digests and incubated for 1 h at rt on a nutating mixer. Samples were centrifuged (1000 g, 1 min, rt) to collect the beads. The streptavidin beads were washed with 2 x 1 mL 0.5% SDS in PBS, 3 x 1 mL water, and 2 x 1 mL 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by elution of the binding site peptides with 2 x 75 µL freshly prepared 50 mM Na2S2O4 and 50 mM DTT in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, incubating 30 min each time. The beads were washed with 50 µL 1% formic acid, which was combined with the eluates and the peptide samples were then purified directly on mixed-mode ion-exchange cartridges (Oasis, Water s).   Mass spectrometric analysis of binding site peptides The pure peptides were reconstituted in 50 µL nanoLC-MSliquid chromatography (LC) running buffer (4% AcN,  0.1% formic acid in water) and 5 µL was analysed by nanoLC tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS),  .on an EASY 1000 nanoLC coupled to a Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide samples were separated on a C-18 reverse phase column (PepMap from Thermo Scientific with 25 cm length, 75 μm inner diameter, and 2 μm particle size) and eluted by a 70 minutes linear gradient of acetonitrile (4–40%) containing 0.1% formic acid. The MS was operated in data dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS2 acquisition, with mass resolution of 70,000 and 17,500, respectively.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis The nanoLC-MS/MS spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant (1.5.3.30), searching for peptides containing an added mass on lysine corresponding to that of the cleaved probe analogue of the HTO (+326.1379) or HDMP (+310.1430) modification. Additionally, we searched for the binding sites containing a sulfonation (SO3, +79.9568) as well, since this is a side reaction that can occur during the elution with Na2S2O4. R (3.3.1) was used for further  sorting the data: For a specific binding site identification to be accepted and reported here, we require the site to be present in all three samples at the highest concentration (5 mM) and none of the controls (0 mM). Furthermore, the peptides were was required to have a posterior error probability (PEP) of <1%.

### Publication Abstract
The &#x3b1;-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal is a ubiquitous and highly reactive metabolite known to be involved in aging- and diabetes-related diseases. If not detoxified by the endogenous glyoxalase system, it exerts its detrimental effects primarily by reacting with biopolymers such as DNA and proteins. We now demonstrate that during ketosis, another metabolic route is operative via direct non-enzymatic aldol reaction between methylglyoxal and the ketone body acetoacetate, leading to 3-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione. This novel metabolite is present at a concentration of 10%-20% of the methylglyoxal level in the blood of insulin-starved patients. By employing a metabolite-alkyne-tagging strategy it is clarified that 3-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione is further metabolized to non-glycating species in human blood. The discovery represents a new direction within non-enzymatic metabolism and within the use of alkyne-tagging for metabolism studies and it revitalizes acetoacetate as a competent endogenous carbon nucleophile.
