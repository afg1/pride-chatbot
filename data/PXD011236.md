### Title
The COMA complex plays a role in positioning Ipl1 activity proximal to Cse4 nucleosomes

### Description
Kinetochores are macromolecular protein complexes that ensure accurate chromosome segregation by linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules and integrating safeguard mechanisms. In yeast, the inner kinetochore, also known as Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), is specifically established at point centromeres and has been implicated in contributing to Aurora-BIpl1 function. In an attempt to gain a more detailed picture of the budding yeast kinetochore architecture, crosslink-guided in vitro reconstitution revealed novel direct interactions of the inner kinetochore assembled on Cse4CENP-A nucleosomes. The Ame1/Okp1CENP-U/Q heterodimer selectively bound Cse4CENP-A nucleosomes through the Cse4 N-terminus, providing an explanation for the essential role of the COMA complex in budding yeast. Moreover, the Sli15/Ipl1 core chromosomal passenger complex was found to directly interact with COMA in vitro, suggesting a hitherto unknown role of the COMA complex in establishing biorientation. In line with this finding, in vivo artificial tethering of Sli15 to inner kinetochore proteins rescued synthetically lethal subunit deletion phenotypes in a Sli15 centromere targeting deficient mutant. This study reveals characteristics of the inner kinetochore architecture assembled at point centromeres and its implications on chromosomal passenger complex function.

### Sample Protocol
The complex containing Cse4 nucleosome, Mif2, Ame1/Okp1, Ctf19/Mcm21, Chl4/Iml3 and Mtw1C was assembled in solution. It was cross linked using an equimolar mixture of isotopically light (hydrogen) and heavy (deuterium) labeled bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (BS3, H12/D12) (Creative Molecules) at a final concentration of 0.25 - 0.5 mM at 10 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by adding ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 100 mM for 10 min at 10 °C. The sample was submitted to size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) and the fractions corresponding to the crosslinked complex were selected for the subsequent protein digest and mass spectrometry (described further down).  Crosslinked samples were denatured by adding 2 sample volumes of 8 M urea, reduced with 5 mM TCEP (Thermo Scientific) and alkylated by the addition of 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were digested with Lys-C (1:50 (w/w), Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 35 °C for 2 h, diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and digested with trypsin (1:50 (w/w), Promega) overnight. Peptides were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a final concentration of 1% and purified by reversed phase chromatography using C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak, Waters). Crosslinked peptides were enriched on a Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/30 column using water/acetonitrile/TFA (75/25/0.1, v/v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 50 μl/min and were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an Orbitrap Elite instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Fragment ion spectra were searched and crosslinks were identified by the dedicated software xQuest. The results were filtered according to the following parameters: Δ score ≤ 0.85, MS1 tolerance window of -4 to 4 ppm and score ≥ 22. The quality of all crosslink spectra passing the filter was manually validated and crosslinks were visualized as network plots using the webserver xVis.
