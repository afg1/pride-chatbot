### Title
Sequential modulation of RNase III and RNase G expression in response to host environment conditions promotes pathogenicity through the control of hns expression in Salmonella Typhimurium

### Description
Our results demonstrate that RNase G controls expression levels of H-NS encoded by hns, strongly associated with the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium. The hns mRNA abundance is mediated by RNase G, which cleaves the 5’-UTR of hns mRNA. In the upstream pathway, the induced expression of RNase G in host environment condition is attributable to reduced RNase III cleavage activity on rng mRNA. Our findings suggest the link between Salmonella pathogenicity and RNase III-RNase G pathway, underlining the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of H-NS in the downstream pathway, which controls Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 type III secretion system for the survival and virulence of S. Typhimurium in host cell.

### Sample Protocol
Protein expression patterns in supernatants and whole cell lysates of wild-type and rng-deleted cells were compared during cultivation in LB medium with aeration (180 rpm) at 37°C. supernatants of the 10-mL cultures were treated with 10 mM DTT and 1×protease cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and filtrated using 0.2 μm membrane filters to remove cell debris, and concentrated using centrifugal filter units with a cutoff value of 10 kDa (Merck Millipore, Tullagreen, Ireland). The concentrated supernatants were analyzed by SDS PAGE, and the protein bands between 30 and 90 kDa were subjected to alkylation of cysteine with 4.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide (Sigma, St Louis, USA), and were followed by trypsin digestion for mass spectrometry analysis. Tryptic peptides eluted from the gels were dissolved in 0.4% acetic acid and analyzed on a Velos Pro Mass analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) with a nano-liquid chromatography system and a Magic C18AQ column (75 μm by 75 mm).

### Data Protocol
The acquired tandem mass spectrometric data were analyzed by the SEQUEST search of Thermo Proteome Discoverer program version 1.3 against a sequence database of proteins derived from the complete genome assembly of S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 (GCA_000210855.2) in the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information. The search options were as follows: average mass (m/z), maximum of 1 miscleavage site of trypsin digestion, precursor mass tolerance of 1.5 Da, fragment mass error of 1.0 Da, dynamic modification for oxidation of methionine, static modification for alkylation of cysteine, protein probability >99%, and a false-discovery rate (FDR) <0.01. Individual peptides were subsequently filtered at a probability >0.95 and proteins were identified with two or more unique peptides.
