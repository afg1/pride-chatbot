### Title
Determining the composition of unfolded barnase aggregates

### Description
We showed the phase separation or aggregation of globular proteins is dependent on the protein stability and the sticker composition of the unfolded protein using barnase, a model protein. Here, we determined the composition of barnase aggregates in cells to investigate how the stability and sequence grammar of the unfolded barnase influences interactions with the endogenous proteome.

### Sample Protocol
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with fluorophore-tagged barnase constructs, permeabilised with digitonin to remove soluble proteins, lysed with RIPA buffer and aggregates were solublised with urea and sonication. Samples acetone precipitated, trypsinised and solid phase extraction cleanup was performed prior to TMT labelling and LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS raw data was processed using maxquant to search for identified peptides and data was further processed using python and MATLAB scripts.
