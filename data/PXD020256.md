### Title
Three protein extraction methods for mass spectrometry proteomics of fresh frozen mouse tissue

### Description
We present three different methods for protein extraction from fresh frozen mouse heart tissue: 1) extraction using SDS buffer followed by FASP purification, 2) extraction using SDS buffer followed by S-Trap purification, and 3) extraction using a guanidine hydrochloride buffer followed by in-solution digestion. Based on bicinchoninic acid assay, all three methods display similar recovery of total protein content. However, proteomics-based analysis identified far fewer proteins from the extraction guanidine hydrochloride. SDS-FASP identifies as many proteins as the SDS-STrap method with good coverage of proteins from different cellular compartments.

### Sample Protocol
Three extraction methods were performed on fresh frozen mouse heart tissue: 1) Extraction using SDS buffer followed by FASP purification, 2) Extraction using SDS buffer followed by S-Trap purification, and 3) Extraction using a guanidine hydrochloride buffer followed by in-solution digestion. Protein extracts were reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin and desalted by solid phase extraction. Peptides were either loaded onto LC-MS as a single shot data dependent acquisition (DDA) or were pre-fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) with 5 fractions collected and loaded onto LC-MS for DDA acquisition.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant v1.6.0.16. The target search database was the mouse proteome from SwissProt, containing isoforms (version November 2018) supplemented with sequences of common contaminant proteins from cRAP. 1% FDR rate was set for PSM and protein levels. The resultant protein list was subjected to Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis using PANTHER classification system.
