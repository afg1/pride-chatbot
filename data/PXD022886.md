### Title
Serum proteomics of sng- and pain-trend fibromyalgia patients

### Description
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition and consists of widespread pain with similarities to neuropathic pain in clinical findings, pathophysiology, and neuropharmacology. Its mechanisms are poorly understood and a lack of effective biomarkers for diagnosis and onset prediction. This study aimed to identify the metabolites to characterize pain and sngception (Sng) in FM.

### Sample Protocol
Serum samples were individually immunodepleted by Proteome Purify 12 Human Serum Protein Immunodepletion Resin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manufacturer嚙踐�� protocol. Twenty-one immunodepleted serum samples of control participants were randomly pooled into three grouped samples, each containing 7 individuals. A pooled sample, which served as 嚙踐�ternal reference嚙踝蕭, was made up of aliquots of protein from all samples. The immunodepleted proteins were reduced, S-alkylated, trypsin digested, and desalted. The desalted peptides were TMT-labeled by TMTsixplex嚙踝�� Isobaric Label Reagent Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA,USA). A total 8 batches of TMT-labeled, mixed samples were prepared. Each batch of TMT-labeled samples was further fractionated by High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Raw data files from nanoLC-MS/MS were search against Uniprot human database (The data files were searched against the Uniprot human database (August, 2020) using Andromeda algorithm in MaxQuant software (v. 1.6.14.0). TMT quantitation was also performed in MaxQuant with 嚙踐�tching-between-run嚙踝蕭 function. Further data processing and statistics were performed using Perseus software (v. 1.6.14.0) as previously described.  Signals from each channel were normalized with the internal reference channel, i.e. TMT131, in each TMT batch, and further normalized by quantile normalization method.
