### Title
Proteomic analyses of the early stage of interaction between Caballeronia mineralivorans PML1(12) and mineral

### Description
Next-generation proteomics of Caballeronia mineralivorans PML1(12) to decipher the potential molecular mechanisms explaining its mineral weathering effectiveness.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for a short electrophoretic migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by  Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were then compared.
