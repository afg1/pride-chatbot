### Title
Low-dose anti-HIV drug efavirenz mitigates retinal vascular lesions in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease

### Description
A small dose of the anti-HIV drug efavirenz (EFV) was previously discovered to activate CYP46A1, a cholesterol-eliminating enzyme in the brain, and mitigate some of the manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease in 5XFAD mice(a mouse model foe Alzheimers disease. Herein, we investigated the retina of these animals, which were found to have genetically determined retinal vascular lesions associated with deposits within the retinal pigment epithelium and sub retinal space.. Thus gain an unbiased insight into the processes in the retina that could be to  affected by efavirenz treatment, the proteomic approach was used to compare the retinas of efavirenz -treated and control 5XFAD mice.

### Sample Protocol
Three biological replicates per group, each representing a pooled sample of one retina plus RPE from five to six 9-month-old 5XFAD male mice after efavirenz Tx and Control group. Each sample was lysed with 2% SDS and PIC Physical protein extraction using pulse sonification FASP detergent cleanup (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1322) Total protein concentration determination 20 ug of sample was digested with LysC/Trypsin 600ng was analyzed via 4hr LC/MS/MS method

### Data Protocol
Differences in relative protein abundance were calculated by the PEAKS X (http://www.bioinfor.com/peaks-software/) based on unique peptides. Proteins with non-significant changes (P > 0.05) in abundance between the groups were excluded from the subsequent analysis as were the proteins with less than 1.1-fold change in the relative abundance, even if this change was significant.
