### Title
Naringenin Suppresses BEAS-2B-derived Exosomal Cargoes Disorder Caused by Cigarette Smoke Extract thereby Inhibiting M1 Macrophage Polarization

### Description
Effects of cigaratte smoke extract and naringenin on the exosomal proteome derived from human airway epithelial cells

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, exosomes were isolated with SDT buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, PH 7.6) and the exosomal proteins were quantified with the BCA Protein Assay Kit. 200 μg of proteins for each sample were reduced with 50 mM dithiothreitol and repeated ultrafiltration using a UA buffer (8 M Urea, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Then 100 μl iodoacetamide was added to block reduced cysteine residues and the filters were washed with 100 μl UA buffer three times and then 100 μl 25 mM NH4HCO3 buffer twice. Finally, the protein suspensions were digested with 4 μg trypsin in NH4HCO3 buffer overnight at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate. Samples were analyzed on a nanoElute (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a timsTOF Pro (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a CaptiveSpray source. Peptides were separated on an analytical column, 1.6μm C18 beads with a packed emitter tip (IonOpticks, Australia). The column was equilibrated using 4 column volumes before loading the sample in 100% buffer A (99.9% MilliQ water, 0.1% FA). Samples were separated at 300nl/min using a linear gradient and the timsTOF Pro was operated in PASEF mode.

### Data Protocol
The raw data were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.6.14.0. The cutoff of the false discovery rate for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. Protein abundance was calculated based on the normalized spectral protein intensity. Proteins which Fold change > 2 or < 0.5 and p-value < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed proteins. Bioinformatics analyses for differentially expressed exosomal proteins in this study were performed using the OmicStudio tools at https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool. The heat map was performed using the Advanced Heatmap Plots tool to visualize all of the differentially expressed exosomal proteins. The annotation from Gene Ontology (GO) terms to proteins was completed by Blast2GO Command-Line. Then further improvement of annotation and connection between GO terms were carried out by ANNEX. Pathway analysis was performed using the KEGG database. Fisher's Exact Test was used to identify the significantly enriched GO terms and pathways by comparing the number of differentially expressed proteins and total proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated epithelium-macrophage crosstalk has been proved to maintain lung homeostasis in cigarette smoke-induced lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In our previous study, we found that EVs derived from cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treated BEAS-2B promoted M1 macrophage polarization, which probably accelerated the development of inflammatory responses. Naringenin has been proved to suppress M1 macrophage polarization, but whether naringenin regulates macrophage polarization mediated by EVs has not been reported. In this study, we firstly found that EVs derived from naringenin and CSE co-treated BEAS-2B significantly inhibited the expression of CD86 and CD80 and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b1;, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and IL-12 in macrophage induced by EVs derived from CSE-treated BEAS-2B. Further research revealed that naringenin downregulated BEAS-2B-derived EVs miR-21-3p which targeted phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten/protein kinase B (PTEN/AKT) cascade in macrophages and then suppressed M1 macrophage polarization. Subsequent proteomics suggested that naringenin decreased BEAS-2B-derived EVs poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)1 expression thereby suppressing M1 macrophage polarization probably. Our study provides novel pharmacological references for the mechanism of naringenin in the treatment of cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammatory diseases.
