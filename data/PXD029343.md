### Title
Alternative polyadenylation factor CPSF6 regulates temperature compensation of the mammalian circadian clock

### Description
A defining property of circadian clocks is temperature compensation, characterized by the resilience of circadian free-running periods against changes in environmental temperature.We quantify global changes in 3Â´UTR length as well as gene and protein expression between wild type and CPSF6 knock-down cells and their dependency on temperature.

### Sample Protocol
Cellular lysis was performed in 4% SDS. Then proteins were precipitated and 10 ug of each samples digested with Lysine and Trypsine. Peptides were desalted and cleaned up on SDB-RPS stage tips before injection in the MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed with MaxQuant. Subsequent statistical analysis were performed with Perseus.
