### Title
New mixture models for decoy-free false discovery rate estimation in mass-spectrometry proteomics

### Description
We introduce a new decoy-free framework for false discovery rate (FDR) estimation that generalizes present decoy-free approaches (DFAs) while exploiting more search data in a manner similar to target-decoy approaches (TDAs).

### Sample Protocol
HeLa protein digest standard (P/N 88328, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS data were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS. The conversion of LC-MS .raw files to .mgf files was done using MSFileReader (v.2.2.62) and RawConverter v.1.1.0.23. The default conditions for conversion were used, with one exception, charge states from 2 through 7 were used. A new laboratory built the decoy-free framework for FDR estimation was used to process the data.
