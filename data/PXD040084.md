### Title
Cell-selective proteomics segregates pancreatic cancer subtypes by extracellular proteins in tumors and circulation

### Description
Cell-selective proteomics is emerging as a powerful concept for studying heterocellular processes. However, its potential to dissect intercellular signaling has not been exploited, despite its promise to identify non-cell autonomous disease mechanisms or biomarkers. Here, we devised an improved azidonorleucine-based protein labeling, enrichment, and mass spectrometry workflow, to achieve comprehensive proteome coverage of up to >10,100 cell-selective proteins. We provide proof-of-concept for in depth cell-selective secretomics by dissecting bidirectional intercellular signaling between co-cultured primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and macrophages. In vivo, detection of extracellular proteins emerged as a unique strength compared to FACS-based methods. Our analysis reveals systematic differences of cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins between molecular PDAC subtypes in vivo, such as elevated EMT-signal sustaining proteins. Intriguingly, high levels of pre-metastatic niche formation-associated factors in the serum reflected tumor activity in circulation. Our findings highlight how cell-selective proteomics accelerates the discovery of diagnostic markers and new therapeutic targets in cancer.

### Sample Protocol
For proteomics analysis without Anl-enrichment, cells were lysed in SDC buffer (1 % sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 10 mM tris(2-carboxy(ethyl)phosphine) (TCEP), 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide (CAA), 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) heated at 95 Ã‚Â°C for 10 minutes and sonicated to shear DNA. Proteins were digested with trypsin and lysC (1:100 enzyme/ protein ratio, w/w) at 37 Ã‚Â°C, 1000 rpm overnight. Digests were desalted using in-house made styroldivinylbenzol reversed phase sulfonat (SDB-RPS) (3M Empore, 2241) StageTips. MetRS*-based Anl-labeled proteins were enriched using click chemistry-based protocols, reduced and alkylated, and digested with trypsin and lysC. Digests were desalted with different solid-phase extraction protocols. Details are described in the method section of the corresponding article. Desalted peptides from workflows with or without Anl-enrichment were dried in a vacuum concentrator and resolubilized in 0.1 % formic acid. Concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and normalized between samples for equal peptide injection. Negative control samples for the evaluation of Anl-enrichment specificity were adjusted with corresponding volumes to their corresponding MetRS* samples for injections of equal total yield proportions. For offline high pH reversed-phase fractionation of peptide samples (benchmarking of acquisition strategies, Fig 1e) into 16 fractions, a Ã¢â‚¬Å“spider fractionatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was used as described previously by Kulak et al. (2017). Peptide mixtures were analyzed with an EASY-nLC 1000 or 1200 ultrahigh-pressure system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Q Exactive HF (293T Met-substitution), Q Exactive HF-X (enrichment and acquisition method comparisons) or Orbitrap Exploris 480 (all other experiments) instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides (500 ng injections for Q Exactives or 300 ng for Exploris machines) were separated on 50 cm in-house-made 75 Ã‚Âµm inner diameter columns, packed with 1.9-Ã‚Âµm ReproSil C18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH), at a flow rate of 300 nl min-1 and 60 Ã‚Â°C maintained by an in-house-made column oven. Offline pre-fractionated samples used for acquisition method comparison (see Fig. 1) were eluted with a binary buffer system (buffer A: 0.1 % formic acid; buffer B: 80 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid) and a nonlinear gradient starting at 3 % buffer B followed by a stepwise increase to 23 % in 82 min, 40 % in 8 min and a wash out with an increase to 98 % buffer B. Spectra were acquired with a data-dependent Top15 MS/MS method: Full scans (300 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1650 m/z, automatic gain control (AGC) target = 3e6, maximum injection time = 25 ms, resolution = 60,000 at 200 m/z) were followed by 15 MS/MS scans with higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (AGC target = 1e5, maximum injection time = 25 ms, isolation window = 1.5 m/z, normalized collision energy (nce) = 27 %, resolution = 15,000 at 200 m/z). All other samples were analyzed without prefractionation in single shot measurements with a nonlinear gradient starting at 5 % buffer B followed by a stepwise increase to 30 % in 95 min, 60 % in 5 min and a wash out with an increase to 95 % buffer B. Spectra were acquired with a data-dependent Top15 MS/MS method (as described above, but full scans with maximum injection time = 20 ms and MS/MS scans with maximum injection time = 28 ms, isolation window = 1.4 m/z) or data-independent acquisition (used for acquisition method comparison (Fig 1e) and all following experiments) using full scans with a range of 300 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1650 m/z (AGC target = 3e6, maximum injection time = 60 ms, resolution = 120,000 at 200 m/z) followed by MS/MS scans with 32 windows (nce = 27 %, AGC target = 1e6, maximum injection time = 54 ms, resolution = 30,000 at 200 m/z).

### Data Protocol
DDA MS raw files were processed by MaxQuant (version 2.0.1.0.) using default parameters for orbitrap instruments with 1 % FDR at the peptide and protein level, and enabling MaxLFQ for label-free quantification. For analysis of Met-substitute incorporation in 293T cells, Met-Anl, Met-Aha and Met-Met+4 substitutions were added as variable modifications. DIA MS raw files were processed by DIA-NN (version 1.8) with FASTA digest for library-free search and deep learning-based spectra, RTs and IMs prediction enabled. Precursor FDR was set to 1 % and default parameters were used with the following changes: The precursor range was restricted to 300 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1650 m/z and the fragment ion range to 200 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1650 m/z. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“--relaxed-prot-infÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option was enabled via command-line. Mass accuracies and scan window were optimized for individual experiments as recommended by the developers. MBR was enabled, neural network classifier was set to Ã¢â‚¬Å“double-pass modeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and quantification strategy to Ã¢â‚¬Å“robust LC (high accuracy)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. Spectra were matched against the human (June 2022, 79,276 entries) or mouse (January 2022, 55,105 entries) UniProt FASTA database.

### Publication Abstract
Cell-selective proteomics is a powerful emerging concept to study heterocellular processes in tissues. However, its high potential to identify non-cell-autonomous disease mechanisms and biomarkers has been hindered by low proteome coverage. Here, we address this limitation and devise a comprehensive azidonorleucine labeling, click chemistry enrichment, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and secretomics strategy to dissect aberrant signals in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our in-depth co-culture and in vivo analyses cover more than 10,000 cancer cell-derived proteins and reveal systematic differences between molecular PDAC subtypes. Secreted proteins, such as chemokines and EMT-promoting matrisome proteins, associated with distinct macrophage polarization and tumor stromal composition, differentiate classical and mesenchymal PDAC. Intriguingly, more than 1,600 cancer cell-derived proteins including cytokines and pre-metastatic niche formation-associated factors in mouse serum reflect tumor activity in circulation. Our findings highlight how cell-selective proteomics can accelerate the discovery of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in cancer.
