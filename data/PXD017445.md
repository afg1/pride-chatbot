### Title
A chemical screen reveals a connection between lipid metabolism and protein translation

### Description
Cells were treated with the inhibitor gor 3h and 6h. Additionally, proteasome degradation was blocked with MG132 in the samples treteaed for 3h. DMSO treated samples were used as control. Three independent experiments were conducted

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin using S-trap devices. Peptides were subsequently labeled with TMT-11plex reagents and pre-fractionated by means of High pH-reverse phase chromatography. Fractions were finally analyzed by LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant against a human protein database. Differential analysis was done with ProStar: proteins with p.val <0.05 and log2FC >0.3 (<-0.3) were defined as regulated (FDR 5-10% was estimated by Benjamini-Hochberg).
