### Title
Dynamics of the mouse brain cortical synaptic proteome during postnatal brain development

### Description
Development of the brain involves the formation and maturation of numerous synapses. This process requires prominent changes of the synaptic proteome and potentially involves thousands of different proteins at every synapse. To date the proteome analysis of synapse development has been studied sparsely. Here, we analyzed the cortical synaptic membrane proteome of juvenile [postnatal day 9 (P9), P15, P21, P27], adolescent (P35) and different adult ages (P70, P140, P280) of C57Bl6/J mice. Using a quantitative proteomics workflow we quantified 1560 proteins of which 696 showed statistically significant differences over time. Proteins of the presynaptic active-zone and postsynaptic element showed increased levels over time; proteins involved in protein synthesis or neurite outgrowth generally decreased in abundance. In several cases, proteins from a single functional molecular entity, e.g., subunits of the NMDA receptor, showed profound differences in their temporal regulation, which may reflect specific synaptic development features of connectivity, strength and plasticity.

### Sample Protocol
Synaptic membranes were isolated from a single mouse cortex except for mice of postnatal day 9, of which cortices of two animals were pooled to obtain sufficient tissue for subsequent analysis. In short, brain tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose and centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded on top of a sucrose gradient consisting of 0.85 M and 1.2 M sucrose. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 2 h, the synaptosome fraction was collected at the interface of 0.85/1.2 M sucrose and then lysed in hypotonic solution. The resulting synaptic membrane fraction was recovered by ultracentrifugation using the sucrose step gradient as stated above. Synaptic membranes were harvested at the 0.85/1.2 M interface. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). 75 µg protein of synaptic membrane sample was dried in a SpeedVac and used for quantitative proteomics. The dried synaptic membranes were resuspended in 28 µl of 0.5 M Triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8.5, containing 0.85 % RapiGest (Waters associates). A 2 µl cleavage reagent (50 mM Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine) was added and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. A 1 µl Cys blocking reagent (50 mM S-methyl methanethiosulfonate) was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Next, 5 µg of trypsin (Promega) dissolved in water was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Trypsinized peptides were tagged with one unit iTRAQ reagent (Sciex) dissolved in 80 µl isopropanol. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h the 8 samples were pooled and acidified with 5 % TFA to pH 2.5 - 3.0. After 45 min, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac overnight. The dried iTRAQ sample was dissolved in loading buffer (20 % acetonitrile, 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.9) and injected into a SCX column (polysulfoethyl A column from PolyLC). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-500 mM KCl in 20 % acetonitrile, 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.9, over 25 min at a flow rate of 200 µl/min. Fractions were collected at 1 min intervals. SCX fractions were pooled, desalted by solid phase extraction, dried, redissolved in water and subjected to OFFGEL separation. Peptides were fractionated according to their pI using the Agilent OFFGEL 3100 fractionator (Agilent Technologies). Urea 1M was added to the IEF buffer instead of 5 % glycerol mentioned in the manual. Commercially available IPG dry strips 24 cm, with a linear pH gradient ranging from 3-10 (GE-Healthcare) were used. The strips were rehydrated with 40 µl/well rehydration solution in the assembled device for 30 min. 150 µl of the pooled SCX fractions redissolved in water were loaded on each well. The cover fluid (mineral oil, Agilent Technologies) was added to both ends of the gel strip. The focusing method OG24PE01, as supplied by the manufacturer was used in the first OFFGEL experiment (Experiment 1). Typical voltage ranging from 500 to 4500 V was applied until 50 kVh was reached. The maximum current was set to 50 mA and the maximum power to 200 mW. In the subsequent two biological independent samples a longer focusing was applied till 80 kVh (Experiments 2 and 3). The higher volt-hour improved separation. In total 24 fractions were collected per OFFGEL experiment. Each OFFGEL fraction was pre-cleaned using the HLB µElution plates (Waters). The eluates were dried in a SpeedVac, redissolved in 20 µl 0.1 % TFA, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.  Peptides were delivered with a FAMOS autosampler at 30 µl/min to a C18 trap column (1 mm x 300 µM i.d. column) and separated on a nano-C18 column (150 mm x 100 µm i.d. column) at 400 nl/ min using the LC-Packing Ultimate system. Peptides were separated using linearly increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 5-40 % in 50 min and to 90 % in 1 min. The eluent was mixed with matrix (7 mg α-cyano-hydroxycinnaminic acid in 1 ml 50 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % TFA, 10 mM dicitrate ammonium) delivered at a flow rate of 1.5 µl/min and deposited off-line to the Applied Biosystems metal target every 15 s for a total of 192 spots using the probot (Dionex).  Samples were analyzed on a 4800 or 5800 proteomics analyzer (AB-Sciex). Collision-induced dissociation of peptides was performed at 1 kV with air as collision gas. Peptides with signal to noise ratio above 50 at the MS mode were selected for MS/MS, at a maximum of 20 MS/MS per spot. The precursor mass window was set at 200 relative resolution (FWHM). The MS/MS spectrum for each peptide was averaged from 2000 laser shots. The MS run time per OFFGEL fraction of 192 spots were about half to two days for 5800 and 4800 proteomics analyzer, respectively. Thus, the total 5800 proteomics analyzer measurement time for a single OFFGEL experiment was about 12 days.

### Data Protocol
Data obtained by mass spectrometry for each experiment and all three combined were analyzed with ProteinPilot software (version 4.5; Applied Biosystems; MDS Sciex) using the Paragon algorithm (version 4.5.0.0) as the search engine. MS/MS spectra were searched against a mouse database without isoforms (Uniprot-Swissprot_2014/03). The parameters were set to iTRAQ 8-plex (peptide labeled), cysteine modification by MMTS, and trypsin digest. The detected protein threshold was set to 0.05 (10% confidence), bias correction was executed, and iTRAQ isotope correction factors were included. The fold change between labeled peptides (denominator: iTRAQ label 121, age P280) was calculated during the search. The resulting data for each biological replicate were combined, and reverse sequences and proteins with no quantitative values were removed. Furthermore, only proteins with a ProteinPilot unused value larger than 3 (peptide contribution values not claimed by another protein) across all three experiments were considered for posterior analysis.

### Publication Abstract
Development of the brain involves the formation and maturation of numerous synapses. This process requires prominent changes of the synaptic proteome and potentially involves thousands of different proteins at every synapse. To date the proteome analysis of synapse development has been studied sparsely. Here, we analyzed the cortical synaptic membrane proteome of juvenile postnatal days 9 (P9), P15, P21, P27, adolescent (P35) and different adult ages P70, P140 and P280 of C57Bl6/J mice. Using a quantitative proteomics workflow we quantified 1560 proteins of which 696 showed statistically significant differences over time. Synaptic proteins generally showed increased levels during maturation, whereas proteins involved in protein synthesis generally decreased in abundance. In several cases, proteins from a single functional molecular entity, e.g., subunits of the NMDA receptor, showed differences in their temporal regulation, which may reflect specific synaptic development features of connectivity, strength and plasticity. SNARE proteins, Snap 29/47 and Stx 7/8/12, showed higher expression in immature animals. Finally, we evaluated the function of Cxadr that showed high expression levels at P9 and a fast decline in expression during neuronal development. Knock down of the expression of Cxadr in cultured primary mouse neurons revealed a significant decrease in synapse density.
