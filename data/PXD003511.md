### Title
N-acetylation in Acinetobacter baumannii

### Description
Characterization of Nalpha- and Nexpsilon-acetylation in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 using different analytical approaches (isoelectrofocusing, strong cation exchange, immunoprecipitation, CNBr enrichment, and high resolutive and accurate mass spectrometry).

### Sample Protocol
Four approaches were used: 1- Bacterial tryptic peptides were directly analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS; 2- Proteins were separated according to their pI with liquid IEF. After trypsin digestion, peptides were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS; 3- Tryptic peptides were fractionated with SCX and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS; 4- Acetylated peptides were enriched with either CNBr beads for Nalpha-acetylated peptides or antiacetylated lysine antibody followed by nanoLC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Identifications were performed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 using MASCOT as search tool against A. baumannii ATCC 17978 database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr). Each predicted acetylated peptide was manually checked to ensure the peptide sequence and the acetylation site.
