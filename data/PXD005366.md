### Title
Robust, sensitive and automated phosphopeptide enrichment optimized for low sample amounts applied to primary hippocampal neurons

### Description
Due to the low stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation, targeted enrichment prior to LC-MS/MS analysis is still essential. The trend in phosphoproteome analysis is shifting towards an increasing number of biological replicates per experiment, ideally starting from very low sample amounts, placing new demands on enrichment protocols to make them less labor-intensive, more sensitive and less prone to variability. Here, we assessed an automated enrichment protocol using Fe(III)-IMAC cartridges on a AssayMAP Bravo platform to meet these demands. The automated Fe(III)-IMAC-based enrichment workflow proved to be more effective when compared to a TiO2-based enrichment using the same platform and a manual Ti(IV)-IMAC-based enrichment workflow. As initial samples, a dilution series of both human HeLa cell and primary rat hippocampal neuron lysates was used, going down to 0.1 µg of peptide starting material. The optimized workflow proved to be efficient, sensitive and reproducible, identifying, localizing and quantifying thousands of phosphosites from just micrograms of starting material.  To further test the automated workflow in genuine biological applications we monitored EGF-induced signaling in hippocampal neurons, starting with only 200,000 primary cells resulting in approximately 50 µg of protein material. This revealed a comprehensive phosphoproteome, showing regulation of multiple members of the MAPK pathway and reduced phosphorylation status of two glutamate receptors involved in synaptic plasticity.

### Sample Protocol
Cell cultures HeLa cells were grown in Dulbeco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10mM glutamine (all from Lonza, Braine-l′Alleud, Belgium). Six hours before harvesting, the medium was replaced by fresh medium. Cells were harvested and the cell pellets were immediately washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS) and stored at -80°C till further usage.  Dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rats of either sex. Cells were plated at a density of 200,000 per well and treated as described before 29.  The hippocampal cultures were grown in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with B27, 0.5 M glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. At day 14-15 after plating, the cells were stimulated with either vehicle or 10 ng/ml Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF, Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes. Cells were not starved before addition of EGF. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS and stored at -80°C till further usage.   Protein lysis and digestion Cells were lysed, reduced and alkylated in lysis buffer (1% sodiumdeoxycholate (SDC), 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinehydrochloride (TCEP)),  40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) and 100 mM TRIS, pH 8.0 supplemented with phosphotase inhibitor (PhosSTOP, Roche) and protease inhibitor (cOmplete mini EDTA-free, Roche). A Bradford protein assay was performed to quantify protein amount . Cells were heated for 5 min at 95°C, sonicated with a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) for 15 cycles of 30 sec and diluted 1:10 with 50 mM ammoniumbicarbonate, pH 8.0. Proteins were digested overnight at 37C with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 and Lysyl Endopeptidase (Lys-C, Wako) with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:75. SDC was precipitated with 2% formic acid (FA) and samples were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) and eluted with 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and directly subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment or dried down and stored at -80C till further use.   Phosphorylated peptide enrichment Manual Ti(IV)-IMAC-based workflow Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed as described as before 25. Briefly, 500 µg Ti(IV)-beads were packed into a GELoader microtip column and washed with methanol and loading buffer (80% (ACN)/6% TFA). Samples were dissolved in loading buffer and loaded onto the beads. Columns were washed with 50% ACN/0.5% TFA in 200 mM NaCl and 50% ACN/0.1% TFA and phosphopeptides were eluted with 10% ammonia and 80% ACN/2%FA directly a 10% FA. Samples were dried down and stored at -80C till LC-MS/MS analysis. Automated TiO2 and Fe(III)-IMAC-based workflows Phosphorylated peptides were enriched using either TiO2 or Fe(III)-NTA 5 µl (Agilent technologies) in an automated fashion using the AssayMAP Bravo Platform (Agilent technologies). TiO2 columns were primed with 250 µl 5% ammonia / 15% ACN and equilibrated with loading buffer (50% ACN/2% TFA). Samples were dissolved in 200 µl loading buffer and loaded onto the column. The cartridges were washed with 250 µl loading buffer and the phosphorylated peptides were eluted with 25 µl 5% ammonia directly into 25µ 10% formic acid and dried down. Fe(III)-NTA cartridges were primed with 250 µl 0.1% TFA in ACN and equilibrated with loading buffer 250 µl (80% ACN/0.1% TFA). Samples were dissolved in 200 µl loading buffer and loaded onto the cartridge. The columns were washed with 250 µl loading buffer and the phosphorylated peptides were eluted with 25 µl 1% ammonia directly into 25 µl 10% formic acid. Samples were dried down and stored in -80° C till subjected to LC-MS/MS.  Mass spectrometry: RP-nanoLC-MS/MS The data were acquired using an UHPLC 1290 system (Agilent) coupled to an Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were first trapped (Dr Maisch Reprosil C18, 3 μm, 2 cm x 100 μm) before being separated on an analytical column (Agilent Poroshell EC-C18, 2.7 μm, 50 cm x 75 μm). Trapping was performed for 10 min in solvent A (0.1 M acetic acid in water) and the gradient was as follows; 4 - 8% solvent B (0.1 M acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile) in 2 min, 8 - 24% in 71 min, 24 - 35% in 16 min, 35 - 60% in 7 min, 60 - 100% in 2 min and finally 100 % for 1 min. Flow was passively split to 300 nl min-1. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode. Full scan MS spectra from m/z 375–1600 were acquired at a resolution of 35,000 at m/z 400 after accumulation to a target value of 3E6. Up to ten most intense precursor ions were selected for fragmentation. HCD fragmentation was performed at normalised collision energy of 25% after the accumulation to a target value of 5E4. MS/MS was acquired at a resolution of 17,500.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.30). The database search was performed against the human Swissprot database (version 25th of June 2015) or the Rattus Norvegicus Ensemble database (version 12th of March 2016) using Andromeda as search engine. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation, protein N-term acetylation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was specified as enzyme and up to two miss cleavages were allowed. Filtering was done at 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at the protein and peptide level. Label free quantification (LFQ) was performed and ‘match between runs’ was enabled. Quantified data were processed and analysed using a custom Python package (PaDuA) to remove potential contaminants and reverse peptides, filtered for localization probability > 0.75, log2 transformed and normalized to column median as per standard methods. Statistical analysis, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), correlation and clustering were performed on the processed data.
