### Title
The rice nucleotide-dependent heterotrimeric G-protein interactome

### Description
The Î±-subunit of the rice heterotrimeric G-protein (RGA1) was used as bait to screen for guanine nucleotide-dependent protein partners by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS).

### Sample Protocol
Please refer to publication for details on the sample processing protocol.

### Data Protocol
Label-free quantification using Progenesis QI for proteomics v2.0, database searching with Mascot v2.5.1, and data processing/analysis using R v3.5.1.
