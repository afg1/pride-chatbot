### Title
Temperature influences the composition and cytotoxicity of extracellular vesicles in Staphylococcus aureus

### Description
Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium but also a commensal of skin and anterior nares in humans. As S. aureus transits from skins/nares to inside the human body, it experiences changes in temperature. The production and content of S. aureus extracellular vesicles (EV) have been increasingly studied over the past few years and EVs are increasingly being recognized as important to the infectious process. Nonetheless, the impact of temperature variation on S. aureus EVs has not been studied in detail as most reports that investigate EV cargoes and host cell interactions are performed using vesicles produced at 37˚C. Here we report that S. aureus vesicle production is temperature-dependent with greater vesiculation at 40˚C. We demonstrate that the temperature dependent regulation of vesicle production in S. aureus is mediated by the alpha phenol soluble modulin peptides (αPSMs). Through proteomic analysis, we observed increased packaging of virulence factors at 40˚C whereas more total proteins are present in EVs produced at 34˚C. Similar to the protein content, we perform transcriptomic analysis and demonstrate that the RNA cargo is impacted by temperature also. Finally, we demonstrate greater αPSM- and α-toxin mediated erythrocyte lysis with 40˚C EVs but 34˚C EVs are more cytotoxic toward THP-1 cells. Together our study demonstrates that small temperature variations have great impact on EV biogenesis and shape the interaction with host cells.

### Sample Protocol
Extracellular vesicles were isolated from S. aureus cultures. Cultures were centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 X g. Supernatants were filter-sterilized through 0.22 µm membranes and concentrated using 100 kDa concentrators (MAP100C37, Pall). ExoQuick-TCTM buffer (ExoTC20A-1, System bioscience) was added (1/5 of total volume) to the retentates and incubated overnight on ice at 4˚C. Mixtures were centrifuged at 1,500 X g for 30 min at 4˚C and vesicle pellets were resuspended in 500 µl of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). A volume corresponding to 50 µg of EVs was precipitated by using the ExoQuick-TCTM buffer. EVs pellets were prepared using S-trap micro columns (Protifi) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, samples were resuspended in 5 % (w/v) SDS, 10 mM DTT, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific), reduced for 10 min at 95 °C, and clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by Pierce 660 nm protein assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) and samples standardized to 50 µg, reduced with 30 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at RT, quenched with 1.2 % (v/v) phosphoric acid, combined with S-trap buffer (100 mM TEAB pH 7.4 in 90 % (v/v) methanol), and adsorbed to the S-trap columns and washed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Digestion was performed using 1 µg trypsin in TEAB, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Samples were eluted, desiccated, and resuspended in 1 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid. Trypsin-digested peptides (5 µl) were separated on a 50 cm Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Ultimate3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 180 min gradient (2 to 32 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid). Peptides were analyzed on a hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument (Q Exactive Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using data-dependent acquisition in which the top 10 most abundant ions were selected for MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were searched against the S. aureus USA300 proteome (UniProt ID: UP000001939) using MaxQuant (www.maxquant.org) and the integrated Andromeda search engine. Digestion was set as trypsin/P, variable modifications included oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N-term), and carbamidomethylation (C) was fixed. Label free quantification was used, with peptides matched between runs. Other settings were left as defaults. The resulting protein groups files were further processed using Perseus, and for whole proteome experiments this included an imputation step with default settings. Unpaired T-test with Welch’s correction was used to establish significant changes in protein abundance (LFQ intensity) between samples.
