### Title
Human ZDHHC13 phosphorylation test

### Description
We use microcapillary LC/MS/MS to examine the phosphorylation sites of purified human ZDHHC13 protein.

### Sample Protocol
We excised gel bands of purified ZDHHC13 protein and sent it to Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School) for microcapillary LC/MS/MS to examine the phosphorylation sites of purified human ZDHHC13 protein.

### Data Protocol
The facility utilizes Orbitrap mass spectrometers from Thermo Scientific for high throughput analyses ofgel bands/spots.
