### Title
Peptidomics of sorted enteroendocrine cells from human organoids

### Description
A human organoid culture system was set up to grow enteroendocrine cells with a venus labeled on the glucagon gene promoter sequence. This enabled the sorting of glucagon gene positive cells from negative cells, thereby enabling the enrichment of glucagon producing cells for study. Both Venus positive and venus negative cell populations were collected and their peptidome was assessed using nano LC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
Sorted cells were collected directly into 250uL of 6M guanidine hydrochloride and subjected to three freeze thaw cycles. The samples were precipitated with 900uL of 80% ACN in water and the lower aqueous phase was removed and evaporated. The residue was reconstituted and extracted by SPE, and the eluate was evaporated and reduced and alkylated for nano LC-MS analysis using a DDA based approach.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS data was searched against the Uniprot database with a human filter. Fixed modifications were carbamidomethylation, variable modifications were oxidised methionine, N-terminal pyroglutamate, N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation.
