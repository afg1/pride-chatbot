### Title
Structural basis for the inhibition of pathogenic serine ubiquitination by the Legionella metaeffector SidJ

### Description
Structural and functional studies of SidE-family effectors and the metaeffector SidJ in the infection mechanism of Legionella pneumophila, elucidating the role of post-translational modification in modulating effector toxicity.

### Sample Protocol
SidJ 99-C, SdeA 231-1190 and Calmodulin constructs were expressed and purified using Talon bead resin. In vitro reactions were performed with the pruified proteins and the resulting mixtures digested with Trypsin Gold. LC-MS was perfomred on an Easy-nLC1000 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion, or an Easy-nLC1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion LUMOS.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed with MaxQuant 1.6.1 or with Morpheus version 168. Modified peptides identified by Morpheus searches were visualized with a modified version of the Expert system for computer-assisted annotation of MS/MS spectra from the Mann group
