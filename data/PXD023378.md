### Title
A proteomic view of WT and △YdiU Salmonella Typhimurium under iron deficiency condition

### Description
Transition metal iron is essential for bacterial survival and growth. For pathogenic bacteria, this challenge is even more severe since human and other mammals have evolved a complicated mechanism of nutritional immunity to restrict iron availability. Preliminary research findings that iron deficiency significantly elevate expression of YdiU. After the ydiU gene was knocked out, the survival ability of Salmonella in iron deficiency medium was significantly reduced. These results suggest that YdiU may act in the survival of Salmonella under iron deficiency stress conditions. Here, we performed a TMT-based comparative quantitative proteomics analysis to reveal the proteomic differences between the WT and △YdiU in iron deficiency.

### Sample Protocol
All bacterial strains were maintained at −80 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol. A single colony was inoculated into 10 mL LB medium with and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking.  The overnight culture was then subcultured (diluted 1:100 into 10 mL of LB medium) until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached approximately 0.5. For iron deficiency, Salmonella typhimurium (wild-type and △YdiU) were inoculated 600 μM bipyridine for 3h. Cells were collected and washed twice using PBS to remove ions from the medium. After 12,000×g, 10 min, 4 °C centrifugation, the protein concentrations of supernatant samples were measured. Dithiothreitol (Sigma) was added to these samples at 5 mM and incubated at 56 °C for 30 min. Iodoacetamide (Sigma) was then added at 11 mM and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. TEAB (Sigma) was added to dilute samples. Samples were then digested by trypsin (Promega) at 50:1 (protein trypsin) mass ratio overnight and 100:1 for 4 h. Subsequently, peptides were desalted by Strata X C18 (Phenomenex) and vacuumdried. The peptides were dissolved in 0.5 M TEAB and labeled based on the TMT kit (Thermo) instructions. TMT reagent was dissolved in acetonitrile (Fisher Chemical) and added to peptides incubating for 2 h. Each individual subject was labeled with a unique reporter. Then the mixtures were pooled, desalted, and vacuum-dried.

### Data Protocol
Differentially expressed proteins were identified using 1.3-fold change and the Wilcoxon-test p < 0.05 threshold. Subsequently, multiple bioinformatics tools were performed to analyze these proteins. UniProt-GOA was used to generate Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to analyze enriched pathways. For GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, WT proteins was applied to test differentially expressed proteins against all identified proteins. STRING database (v.10.5) was used for constructing protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. The minimum interaction score was 0.400 and the k-means clustering was applied. Further, Cytoscape (v.3.6.0) software was applied to visualize the network.
