### Publication Abstract
DDX58 encodes RIG-I, a cytosolic RNA sensor that ensures immune surveillance of nonself RNAs. Individuals with RIG-IE510V and RIG-IQ517H mutations have increased susceptibility to Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS) defects, resulting in tissue-specific (mild) and classic (severe) phenotypes. The coupling between RNA recognition and conformational changes is central to RIG-I RNA proofreading, but the molecular determinants leading to dissociated disease phenotypes remain unknown. Herein, we employed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and single molecule magnetic tweezers (MT) to precisely examine how subtle conformational changes in the helicase insertion domain (HEL2i) promote impaired ATPase and erroneous RNA proofreading activities. We showed that the mutations cause a loosened latch-gate engagement in apo RIG-I, which in turn gradually dampens its self RNA (Cap2 moiety:m7G cap and N1-2-2'-O-methylation RNA) proofreading ability, leading to increased immunopathy. These results reveal HEL2i as a unique checkpoint directing two specialized functions, i.e. stabilizing the CARD2-HEL2i interface and gating the helicase from incoming self RNAs; thus, these findings add new insights into the role of HEL2i in the control of antiviral innate immunity and autoimmunity diseases.
