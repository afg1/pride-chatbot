### Title
Plasma Proteome Dynamics in the Pig Model of Trauma

### Description
The effect of IV-adminstered Vitamin C on the plasma proteome in the pig trauma model was investigated with label free proteomics. Plasma samples were drawn from 9 male Sinclair swine at baseline, post-trauma, and 0.25, 2, and 4 hourspost resuscitation with 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch. Swine were randomized to receive either saline, low-dose VitC (50 mg/kg), or high-dose VitC (200 mg/kg) during volume resuscitation (N = 3/treatment). High performance LC-MS/MS proteomics was then used to quantitatively measure plasma protein fluctations over time as a function of treatment.

### Sample Protocol
Depletion of albumin and IgG from all plasma samples followed by FASP-10kDa MWCO (reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin).

### Data Protocol
Proteomic datasets were processed in MaxQuant (ver. 1.5.8.3) using the Andromeda search algorithm against the Uniprot Swine Proteome FASTA database (download: 6/12/2017). Protein abundances were log2 transformed in Perseus (ver. 1.5.8.5) and missing values imputed with normal distribution-derived values.
