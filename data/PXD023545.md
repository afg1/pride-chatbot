### Title
HLA-B*15:02 peptide presentation in the presence of carbamazepine and related molecules

### Description
Characterisation of peptides presented by the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecule HLA-B*15:02 in the presence and absence of carbamazepine (CBZ), and related molecules carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (ECBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC).

### Sample Protocol
C1R.B*15:02 cells were treated with 25ug/mL carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide or oxcarbazepine for 48hrs and snap frozen. Cells (0.9-1.1 x 109 per experiment) were lysed and the HLA class I isolated using the pan HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32. HLA-bound peptides were acid eluted with 10% acetic acid and fractionated by RP-HPLC. Fractions containing peptides were vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a data dependent acquisition (DDA) strategy on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) utilizing a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptide sequences were assigned using PEAKS X+ (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) database search. Settings:  Database - reviewed human proteome (UniProt/Swiss-Prot, accessed October 2018), plus database of common contaminants.  Instrument – OrbiTrap (Orbi-Orbi)  Fragment – HCD Acquisition – DDA Parent Mass Error Tolerance - 20.0 ppm Fragment Mass Error Tolerance - 0.02 Da Precursor Mass Search Type – monoisotopic Enzyme – None Variable Modifications - Oxidation (M) 15.99, Deamidation (NQ) 0.98, and Cysteinylation: 119.00, Max Variable PTM Per Peptide - 3.
