### Title
LFQ proteome comparsion of Burkholderia cenocepacia glycosylation mutants

### Description
Characterisation of the effect of glycosylation disruption within Burkholderia cenocepacia k56-2. Five strain comparsion (WT vs delta pglL vs delta OGC vs Delta pglL OGC vs Delta pglL complemented S7-pglL-his)

### Sample Protocol
feshly prepared whole cell pellets were solubilized in SDS lysis buffer (4% SDS, 100mM Tris Ph8.0, 10mM DTT), quantified and precipitated overnight with ice-cold acetone. 100ug of precipitated protein per sample were resuspend in 6M urea, 2M thiourea, reduced with 10mM DTT for one hour and then alkylated with 20mM CAA for one hour. Lys-C was added at a ratio of 1:200 and samples allowed to digest for 4 hours. Each sample was then diluted with 100mM ABC and digested overnight with 2ug trypsin (1:50 ratio). Digested samples were acidified with formic acid (to 1%) and cleaned up using home made STAGE tips (EMPORE C18 material).

### Data Protocol
Data was searched using Maxquant version 1.5.5.1 using trypsin specifcity, up to 2 misscleavage events and allowing oxidation of Methionine. Matching between runs and LFQ based quantification was enabled.
