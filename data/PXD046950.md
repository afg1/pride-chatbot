### Title
AP-MS interactome studies on mutant GATAD1 variants

### Description
Tetracycline inducible, stable HEK-293 cell lines expressing BirA-FLAG-GATAD1 variants were generated using the Flp-In system. Besides WT GATAD1, S102P (ProMut), S102D (AspMut), and S102A (AlaMut)mutant variants were studied. The goal of the experiment was to compare the differences in the interactomes of WT GATAD1 and its mutant counterparts. As a control samples not induced with tetracycline were used.

### Sample Protocol
For FLAG immunoprecipitation, ANTI-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads (M8823, SIGMA-ALDRICH) were used following the manufacturer's protocol. After immunoprecipitation the beads were resuspended on ammonium bicrabonate buffer and on-bead digest with 1 μg of trypsin overnight followed. the next day peptides were transferred to a fresh tube and 10 mM DTT was added for 30 minutes at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 20 minutes at 37 °C in the dark. After acidification with formic acid, samples were desalted with StageTips.

### Data Protocol
The raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant version 1.6.7.0 in a label free mode. Match between runs was used
