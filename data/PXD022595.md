### Title
TMT-based milk and serum proteomics in subclincal and clinical bovine mastitis

### Description
Bovine mastitis, the infection of the mammary gland which leads to great health and economic challenges for dairy farmers is accompanied by dramatic changes in the milk proteome.  In this study of naturally occurring mastitis not only have the changes in the milk proteome been quantified in subclinical and clinical mastitis but simultaneous changes in the serum proteome have also been characterised and quantified.  Milk and serum samples from healthy dairy cows (n=12) were compared to those of cows with subclinical (n=10) and clinical mastitis (n=112) using TMT label-based proteomic approach.  The study included the milk and serum samples taken from thirty-two dairy cows ( kept on private farms located in Croatia. All cows were checked by physical examination. Somatic cells count (SCC) and mastitis test in milk samples were performed. According to the results, cows were assigned into three groups: Group I (control, n=10) consisted of healthy cows with SCC below 400,000 cells/ml on the monthly check-up and a negative mastitis test and without any clinical sign of mastitis. Group II (subclinical mastitis, n=12) comprised cows without clinical signs of mastitis but with SCC above 400,000 cells/ml on the monthly basis and a positive mastitis test at the time of sampling. Group III (clinical mastitis, n=10) consisted of cows with clinical signs of mastitis which include changes in milk appearance (flakes and clots in milk), different stages of udder inflammation (hyperemia, edema, pain, udder enlargement and elevated udder temperature) and disturbance of general health (depression, relaxed cold ears, dehydration, elevated body temperature, increased heart and respiratory rate, decreased ruminal contraction and decreased appetite).   Blood samples were taken from v. coccygea and centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min after clotting for two hours at room temperature. Serum samples were stored at -80°C until analysis.   Milk samples were taken aseptically before the morning milking. First few streams were discarded. Teat ends were disinfected with cotton swabs soaked with 70% ethanol. Samples were taken into sterile tubes and transported to laboratory on ice within a few hours.

### Sample Protocol
Relative quantification of proteins in milk and serum was performed using shotgun Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach previously described (Horvatić et al. J Proteomics 2019; 192: 64-77). In brief, total protein concentration in samples was determined using BCA assay. Internal standards were prepared for both milk and serum samples by mixing equal amounts of all milk or serum samples, respectively. An amount of 35 µg of total proteins from individual samples and internal standards was diluted using 0.1 M triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) and subsequently reduced (20 mM DTT, 60 min, 55°C), alkylated (30 mM IAA, 30 min, room temperature in the dark) and acetone-precipitated (6 volumes, overnight,-20°C). Protein digestion was prepared using trypsin Gold (Promega; 1:35 w/w, at 37°C overnight). Subsequently, peptides were labelled using freshly prepared  TMT sixplex reagents (Thermo Scientific). For each sample type (milk and serum), differentially TMT-labelled samples were combined with the matching internal standard, aliquoted, dried and stored at -20°C for further DDA LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.3., Thermo Fisher Scientific) with SEQUEST algorithm implemented. Database search against Bos taurus NCBInr FASTA files (downloaded 04/04/2019, 69663 entries) was performed according the following parameters: two trypsin missed cleavage sites, precursor and fragment mass tolerances of 10 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively; carbamidomethyl (C) fixed peptide modification, oxidation (M) and TMT sixplex (K, peptide N-terminus) dynamic modifications. Proteins with at least two unique peptides and 5% FDR were selected as reliably identified. Internal standard was used to compare data between TMT experiments.
