### Title
ESCRT complexes in Giardia intestinalis  (CHMP7)

### Description
To access ESCRT subunit presence, distribution and main interactors, we performed iterative co-immunoprecipitation on recombinant Giardia subunits.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were crosslinked in formaldehyde and lysed. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-HA beads. After bead elution, samples were loaded into a gel and bands were analysed by LC-MS.

### Data Protocol
Analysis was performed using Scaffold (version 4). We compared exclusive spectrum counts between transgenic and non transgenic lines to allow resolution between positive and false positives. We used a threshold of 95-2-95 (protein/peptide) allowing strigent selection of baits.
