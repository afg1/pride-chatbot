### Title
Human pancreatic cancer LC-MSMS

### Description
This project aims to  research protein-protein interaction of pancreatic cancer cells under different DNA replication pressure.

### Sample Protocol
Pancreatic cancer cells were cultured under normal conditions with/without gemcitabine. Cells were arrested in S phase, and IPOND was performed, Samples were incubated at 95 Â°C for 25 min, followed by mass spectrometry or immunoblotting.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS raw files were searched with Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) against the Human UniProt database (www.uniprot.org) with concatenated reverse protein sequence and common contaminants. The parameters used to identify tryptic peptides for the protein identification were a 10 ppm precursor-ion mass tolerance, 0.6 Da production mass tolerance.
