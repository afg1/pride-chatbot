### Title
High-salt diet promotes hypertrophic scarring through TRPC3-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis dysfunction

### Description
Diet High in salt content have been associated with cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammation. We recently demonstrated that transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) channels regulate myofibroblast transdifferentiation in hypertrophic scars. Here, we examined how high salt activation of TRPC3 participates in hypertrophic scarring during wound healing. In vitro, we confirmed that high salt increased the TRPC3 protein expression and the marker of myofibroblast alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in wild-type mice (WT) primary cultured dermal fibroblasts but not Trpc3-/- mice. Activation of TRPC3 by high salt elevated cytosolic Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in dermal fibroblasts in a TRPC3-dependent manner. High salt activation of TRPC3 enhanced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase action, that activated ROS-triggered Ca2+ influx and the Rho kinase/MLC pathway in WT mice but not Trpc3-/- mice. In vivo, a persistent high-salt diet promoted myofibroblast transdifferentiation and collagen deposition in a TRPC3-dependent manner. Therefore, this study demonstrates that high salt enhances myofibroblast transdifferentiation and promotes hypertrophic scar formation through enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, which activates the ROS-mediated pMLC/pMYPT1 pathway. TRPC3 deficiency antagonizes high salt diet-induced hypertrophic scarring. TRPC3 may be a novel target for hypertrophic scarring during wound healing.

### Sample Protocol
Male TRPC3 knockout mice (Trpc3-/-) and their wild-type littermates (WT) at the age of eight weeks were provided as a gift from Dr. Birnbaumer (Laboratory of Neurobiology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, USA). According to our previous publication, the homozygotes, heterozygotes, and WT littermates were recognized [14]. The animals were kept in a regulated temperature (21°C-23°C) environment with a 12/12-hour light-dark cycle and unrestricted access to food and water. Briefly, Trpc3-/- mice (n = 12) and WT mice (n = 12) were divided into randomized groups and given either a normal diet (ND, 0.25% NaCl) or a high salt concentration diet (HS, 8% NaCl) for 60 days. Then, on the back skin of the mice, open incisions were made. The mice were under anesthesia with 2.5% sevoflurane and kept with 2% sevoflurane. (Matrx VIP 3000, Isoflurane Vaporizer). The mice back hair was neatly removed and sanitized with lodophor. The dorsal area was disinfected with iodophor and 75% ethanol, and each mouse was subjected to two 8-mm circular excision wounds made with scissors above the fascia layer. The postoperative diets of the mice were maintained fed on an HS as experimental group, while ND as control group. Wound area measurements were performed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after injury and samples were obtained at 7, 14 and 21 days after injury. The wound healing rate was determined utilizing ImageJ software (NIH). All animal research was authorized by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University.

### Data Protocol
We used the Mfuzz method for clustering analysis of protein abundance transformations under different continuous samples (e.g., different treatment times or drug concentrations). This method uses a new clustering algorithm fuzzyc-meansalgorithm, which reduces the interference of noise on the clustering results to some extent compared with hardclustering algorithms such as K-means, and this algorithm effectively defines the relationship between genes and clusters. To further understand the biological processes involved in the proteins in each cluster, we performed enrichment analysis of GO function, KEGG pathway and protein structural domains for the proteins in each cluster, respectively.
