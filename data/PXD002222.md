### Title
Rice-xoo interaction phosphoproteome LC-MSMS

### Description
A comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of rice in response to bacterial blight at 0h and 24h after xoo infection

### Sample Protocol
Rice bacterial blight inoculation IRBB5 and IRBB13 plants were inoculated with the Chinese representative strain of Xoo (Zhe173) at the booting stage by the leaf clipping method [60]. The concentrations of Xoo suspension is up to 3x108 cfu/mL. Disease was scored (3 to 5 leaves for each plant) as the percent lesion area (lesion length/leaf length) at ten days after inoculation. In booting stage, around 5 cm long IRBB5 leaves close to the clip position were collected immediately after Xoo inoculation (0h) and 24 hours after inoculation (24h).  Total protein extraction The total proteins were extracted from IRBB5 leaves using the urea-extraction method. Three individual biological replicates were used for each time point. Briefly, 1 gram of rice leaf tissue was grinded into fine powder, lysed with 5 mL lysis buffer (150 mM Tris pH8.0, 8 M urea, 1X phosphoprotein protease inhibitor complex, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by shaken for 30 min at 4℃, and sheared by sonication (80W in power, sonicate 10 seconds, stop 15 seconds to cool down, repeat 10 times). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant was aliquoted, and the proteins were precipitated in 100% acetone, washed in 75% ethanol and resolved in the lysis buffer. Lastly, the extracted total proteins were quantified with Bradford assay. Protein digestion Protein were first reduced with 5mM DTT in 56℃ for 30min, then cold to room temperature, and alkylated with 20mM IAA in dark for 30min, at last added 5mM DTT in dark for 15min.  The reduced and alkylated proteins were digested on the 30kDa filter unit (Millipore) over night with trypsin at pH8.0 (with an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50). Peptides obtained by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) were desalted using C18 Sep-Pak (Waters).  Phosphopeptide enrichment  The digested peptides were resolved with binding buffer (80% ACN, 5% TFA, 1M lac acid), then incubated with TiO2 beads (GL sciences, peptide to TiO2 ratio of 1:4) for three times, each time for 30min then washed with binding buffer for twice. Transfer all TiO2 beads into a 200mL homemade StageTip that with two pieces of C18 solid phase extraction disk (3M), phosphopeptides were washed by elution buffer (40% ACN, 15% NH3H2O) for 4 times. Eluates were subsequently dried to ~5ul in a SpeedVac and reconstituted with 5% MeOH in 1% TFA solution for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS and data analysis Peptides were separated by using a homemade reversed-phase column（75umID x 15CM) and eluted in a 1h 5-30% acetonitrile gradient with an Easy-nLC1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo), analyzed by Q Exactive Plus (Thermo). Spectral data were then searched against rice database in Proteome Discoverer 1.3 suites with Mascot software. The rice database downloaded from the website (ftp://ftp.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/o_sativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_7.0/all.dir/ ). The mass tolerance was set to be 20 ppm for precursor, and it was set 50mmu for the tolerance of product ions. Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein-N term), and Phospho (S/T/Y) was chosen as variable modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification, and one missed cleavage on trypsin was allowed. To screen out the reliable phosphopeptides, FDR (False discovery rates) were assessed using the Percolator tool within the Protein Discoverer package. The results were filtered for peptide rank 1 and high identification confidence, corresponding to 1% false discovery rate. Low-scoring peptides (Mascot score ≤20) were excluded from the analysis when they were not further supported by additional high-scoring identifications in other replicates or experiments. For reliable phosphorylation site analysis, all phosphopeptide hits were automatically re-analyzed by the phosphoRS software within the Protein Discoverer software suite. PhosphoRS probability higher than 90% was required for a phosphorylation site to be considered as localized. Only those peptides which were phosphorylated in at least two of the three biological replicates were considered as truly phosphorylated. The differentially phosphorylated protein was defined to have over two fold changes in the normalized average intensity with credible student’s t-test (P<0.05).
