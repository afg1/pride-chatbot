### Title
Unraveling the mechanism of ethyl acetate extract from Prismatomeris connata Y. Z. Ruan root in treating pulmonary fibrosis: insights from bioinformatics, network pharmacology, and experimental validation

### Description
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a terminal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation, accumulation of extracellular matrix accumulation, inflammatory damage, and tissue structure destruction. The pathogenesis of this disease, especiallyparticularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is still remains unknown. Macrophages play a significant rolemajor roles in organ fibrosis diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. The phenotype and polarization of macrophages are closely associated with the process of pulmonary fibrosis. A new direction in drug research on for antipulmonary fibrosis is focuseds on developing drugs that maintain the stability of the pulmonary microenvironment. Here, tThrough bioinformatics analysis and experiments involving bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, we confirmed the importance of macrophage polarization in IPF. The analysis revealed that macrophage polarization in IPF involves a change in the phenotypice spectrum. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrated showed high expression of M2-type macrophage-related-associated biomarkers and inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus indicating an imbalance in M1/M2 polarization of pulmonary macrophages in mice with pulmonary fibrosis. Our investigation revealed that the ethyl acetate extract (HG2) obtained from the roots of Prismatomeris connataPrismatomeris connata Y. Z. Ruan exhibits therapeutic efficacy against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. HG2 demonstrates the ability to modulates macrophage polarization, alterations in the TGF‐β/Smads pSmad pathway, and downstream protein expression in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. Drawing upon On the basis of our findings, we believe that HG2 exhibits has potential as a novel component of traditional Chinese medicine component for treating pulmonary fibrosis.

### Sample Protocol
Proteomics detection and analysis Protein extraction The sample to be lysed was treated with a lysis buffer comprising 1% SDS, 8 M urea, and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Ltd. Basel, Switzerland). Following vortex mixing, the sample underwent three rounds of vigorous shaking and grinding using a high-flux tissue grinder. Subsequently, the sample was allowed to lyse on ice for a duration of 30 minutes. During this period, the lysate was gently mixed once every 10 minutes. Afterward, the lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 g, at 4 ℃, for a total of 20 minutes. The resulting supernatant was carefully extracted. The protein concentration was then determined using a BCA protein quantitative kit. Proteolysis  From each sample, 100 μg of protein was carefully transferred into a fresh EP tube and then adjusted to a constant volume of 100 μL with 8 M urea. Next, 2 μL of 0.5M TCEP was introduced and the mixture was left at 37 ℃ for 1 hour. Following this, 4 μL of 1 M iodoacetamide was added, taking precautions to avoid exposure to light, and left at room temperature for 40 minutes. Subsequently, acetone, pre-chilled at -20℃, was added to the sample at a ratio of 1:5 (sample to acetone, volume ratio), and the solution was left to precipitate overnight at -20℃. The ensuing supernatant was carefully discarded following a high-speed centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 minutes at 4℃. Afterward, 1mL of 90% acetone solution, also pre-cooled at -20 ℃, was added, and the sample was re-cleaned through vigorous vortex mixing. The supernatant was again discarded after a high-speed centrifugation, this time for 20 minutes at 4 ℃ at 12,000g. This cleaning process was repeated twice. The sample was then left to air dry at room temperature until the acetone precipitation surface was completely evaporated. Next, the dried sample was reconstituted in 100 μL of 100 mM TEAB. Employing a mass ratio of 1:50 (enzyme to protein), trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was introduced and the sample was subjected to an overnight hydrolysis at 37 ℃. Following desalination with a C18 desalting column, the peptide concentration was determined, and the solution was subsequently freeze-dried. Nano-HPLC-MS/MS data acquisition A suspension was meticulously prepared by adding 30μL of solvent A (A: 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution) to each sample. Subsequently, 9μL of this suspension was combined with 1μL of 10× iRT peptide. The resulting mixture underwent separation via nano-LC, followed by analysis through online electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The entire system utilized the Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer by Thermo Fisher Scientific, located in series with the EASY-nano LC 1200. A total of 6 μL of samples, employing an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 μm x 25 cm), were subjected to a 90-minute gradient separation. The column flow rate was precisely controlled at 250nL/min, with a column temperature maintained at 40°C. Additionally, an electrospray voltage of 2 kV was employed, while the chromatographic gradient spanned 120 minutes. Phase A comprised a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, while phase B consisted of an ACN solution containing 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer operated in data-independent acquisition mode, with the following parameters set: (1) MS1 scanning range (m/z): 350 - 1200; resolution: 120,000; AGC target: 1×106; maximum injection time: 100 ms; (2) HCD-MS/MS: resolution: 50,000; AGC target: 1×105; maximum injection time: 86 ms; collision energy: 33; (3) Variable window acquisition, with 60 windows set, each overlapping by 1m/z.

### Data Protocol
The DIA data underwent analysis using the default parameters of Spectronaut14 (BGS Factory Settings). The retention time and quality window were automatically adjusted based on the iRT peptide software to ascertain the optimal extraction window. For protein qualification, the criteria applied were a Precursor Threshold of 1.0% FDR and a Protein Threshold of 1.0% FDR. A Decoy database was generated using a mutation strategy, akin to disrupting a random number of amino acid sequences (at least 2 amino acids and half the total length of the maximum peptide).  Spectronaut automatically performed corrections, utilizing all MS1 spectra that met the screening criteria to calculate expression levels, while excluding all interfering fragment ions, unless there were fewer than 3 fragment ions present. The quantification of protein groups relied on the average peak area of the first three peptides, ensuring a threshold of less than 1.0% FDR.  For differential screening, proteins were selected based on Welch's ANOVA Test analysis, with criteria set at p-value<0.05 and |fold change|>1.5.
