### Title
Proteome of fluid from human small antral follicles reveals insights in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation.

### Description
Human ovarian follicles develop a fluid-filled antrum when they reach a diameter of around 250 µm. The antrum contains follicular fluid (FF) composed of secretions from cells in the follicle and from circulation. The composition of FF undergoes massive changes in relation to follicular development. Previously, only FF from large pre-ovulatory follicles aspirated just prior to ovulation, has been analyzed by proteomics; resulting in a high proportion of plasma proteins being detected due to diffusion of proteins through the increasingly leaky basal membrane in larger follicles. We present the first proteomics analysis of FF from normal unstimulated human small antral ovarian follicles (diameter: 3-8mm) identifying the largest number of proteins reported in human FF to date: 2,050 proteins of which 1,151 were identified for the first time in human FF by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an identified growth factor, midkine, was shown to impact follicular regulatory processes including enhancement of nuclear maturation of immature human oocytes.

### Sample Protocol
The Follicular fluids from small antral follicles were depleted (Top 7 depletion), digested with trypsin and fractionated by SCX or Basic –RP previous to the analysis for LC-MS/MS. Also, the samples were analysed without any step of depletion or fractionation.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed with Proteome Discoverer v2.2 (Thermo Scientific, San José, CA, USA). To identify the peptides, the MS data was searched against the UniProtKB human database (Released 20180207, 42213 sequences including isoforms) using the integrated SEQUEST HT algorithm. The search was performed with the following parameters: carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and oxidation of methionine residues as static and dynamic modifications, respectively. Precursor and fragment ion tolerances were 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Up to one missed cleavage site for tryptic peptides was allowed. The filters applied were high (FDR<0.01) and medium (FDR<0.05) confidence at peptide and protein level, respectively. The peptide/protein quantification was based on the MS peptide signals (label-free quantification). For label-free quantification the ‘Minora Feature Detector’ node was included in the processing workflow, and the nodes ‘Precursor Ions Quantifier’ and ‘Feature Mapper’ were included in the consensus workflow.
