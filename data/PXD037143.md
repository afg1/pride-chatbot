### Title
Triap1 upregulation promotes escape from mitotic slippage-induced G1 arrest

### Description
Proteomic analysis of G1-arrested human cells after treatment with nocodazole

### Sample Protocol
50 μg of protein extract were added to 50 μL of 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5.1 μg of digested sample was injected onto a quadrupole Orbitrap Q-exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were processed with MaxQuant software (1.5.2.8). MS/MS peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB Human complete proteome database (uniprot_cp_human_2015_03) in which trypsin specificity was used with up to two missed cleavages allowed.
