### Title
iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis reveals genome-wide protein expression patterns in allohexaploid bread wheat in adaptation to potassium deficiency and an important role of jasmonic acid

### Description
Two-week old bread wheat seedlings hydroponically grown Hoagland solution were transferred to potassium (K+)-free conditions for 8 d, their root and leaf proteome profiles were assessed using iTRAQ proteome method, and NCBInr database combined with the recently published bread wheat genome information were used to analyze the identified protein species. Over 4,000 unique proteins were identified, 818 K+-responsive protein species showed significant abundance regulation. The most majority of the identified K+-responsive protein species had exact gene loci, and showed no global but tissue- and chromosome- dependent genome distributions. The identified protein species were associated with diverse functions and exhibited organ-specific differences. Most of identified protein species associated with hormone synthesis were the enzymes involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). Allene oxide synthase (AOS), a key JA synthesis-related enzyme, was significantly induced in both root and leaf organs of K+-deficient wheat seedlings, and its overexpression in rice enhanced the tolerance to low K+ or K+ deficiency, increased contents of K+ and JA and transcription levels of some K+-responsive genes. However, rice AOS T-DNA inserted mutant (osaos) exhibited more sensitivity to K+ deficiency. K+ deficiency significantly increased abundance of a high affinity K+ transporter (TaAHAK1), TaAHAK1 transgenic rice seedlings markedly alleviated sensitivity to K+ deficiency, and K+ deficiency also upregulated expression of homologous OsHAK1 gene in TaAOS transgenic rice plants. These results suggested an essential role of JA in K+ deficiency and gave molecular insight into the responses of plant to K+ deficiency.

### Publication Abstract
Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundant inorganic cation in plants, and molecular dissection of K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has received considerable interest in order to minimize K<sup>+</sup> fertilizer input and develop high quality K<sup>+</sup>-efficient crops. However, the molecular mechanism of plant responses to K<sup>+</sup> deficiency is still poorly understood. In this study, 2-week-old bread wheat seedlings grown hydroponically in Hoagland solution were transferred to K<sup>+</sup>-free conditions for 8 d, and their root and leaf proteome profiles were assessed using the iTRAQ proteome method. Over 4000 unique proteins were identified, and 818 K<sup>+</sup>-responsive protein species showed significant differences in abundance. The differentially expressed protein species were associated with diverse functions and exhibited organ-specific differences. Most of the differentially expressed protein species related to hormone synthesis were involved in jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis and the upregulated abundance of JA synthesis-related enzymes could result in the increased JA concentrations. Abundance of allene oxide synthase (AOS), one key JA synthesis-related enzyme, was significantly increased in K<sup>+</sup>-deficient wheat seedlings, and its overexpression markedly increased concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> and JA, altered the transcription levels of some genes encoding K<sup>+</sup>-responsive protein species, as well as enhanced the tolerance of rice plants to low K<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> deficiency. Moreover, rice AOS mutant (<i>osaos</i>) exhibited more sensitivity to low K<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> deficiency. Our findings could highlight the importance of JA in K<sup>+</sup> deficiency, and imply a network of molecular processes underlying plant responses to K<sup>+</sup> deficiency.
