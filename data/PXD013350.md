### Title
Proteomics analysis of the matrisome from MC38 experimental mouse liver metastases

### Description
Dissemination of primary tumors to distant anatomical sites has a substantial negative impact on patient prognosis. The liver is a common site for metastases from colorectal cancer, and patients with hepatic metastases have generally much shorter survival, raising a need to develop and implement novel strategies for targeting metastatic disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a meshwork of highly crosslinked, insoluble, high molecular weight proteins maintaining tissue integrity and establishing cell-cell interactions. Emerging evidence identifies the importance of the ECM in cancer cell migration, invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. Here, we isolated the extracellular matrix from MC38 mouse liver metastases using our optimized method of mild detergent solubilization followed by biochemical enrichment. The matrices were subjected to label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, revealing proteins highly abundant in the metastatic matrisome.   The resulting list of differentially expressed proteins significantly predicted survival in patients with colorectal cancer but not other cancers with strong involvement of the extracellular matrix component. One of the proteins upregulated in liver metastatic ECM, Annexin A1, was not previously studied in the context of cancer-associated matrisome. Here we show that Annexin A1 was markedly upregulated in colon cancer cell lines compared to cancer cells of other origin, and also overrepresented in human primary colorectal lesions as well as hepatic metastases in comparison with their adjacent healthy tissue counterparts. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive ECM characterization of MC38 experimental liver metastases and proposes Annexin A1 as a putative target for this disease.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were then solubilized in a mixture of 8M urea (9U5378; Sigma), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (09830; Sigma), and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, 43817; Sigma), pH 7.8, and incubated at 37������������������������������������������������������C for 30 min. Iodoacetamide (I1149; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 25 mM and the samples were further incubated for 30 min at RT in dark. Protein concentration was then measured by the detergent-compatible protein assay (5000111; Bio-Rad). Protein was then precipitated via the methanol/chloroform technique with the following resuspension in 50 ������������������������������������������������������L 8M urea and vortexing. Eventually, the urea concentration was reduced to a final concentration of less than 1M by diluting the mixture with ddH2O. ECM-enriched pellets were digested overnight using trypsin (V5111; Promega), at a ratio of 1:50 enzyme:substrate. Samples were constantly vortexed on a shaker at 37������������������������������������������������������C. Another portion of trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:100 enzyme:substrate, and samples were again incubated for 4-6 h at 37������������������������������������������������������C whilst being vortexed. Protein samples were then analyzed with nano���������������������������������������������������������������������������������liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nano���������������������������������������������������������������������������������LC-MS/MS), using the Acquity LC instrument (C18 column with a 75 ������������������������������������������������������mx 250mm, 1.7 ������������������������������������������������������m particle size; Nanoacquity Waters) coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (resolution of 120,000 at 400 m/z, Top 20, collision-induced dissociation), using a gradient of 1���������������������������������������������������������������������������������35% acetonitrile for 60 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min.

### Data Protocol
Peak lists of MS/MS spectra were generated using MSConvert (Proteome Wizard) and further searched using Mascot version 2.3 (http://www.matrixscience.com), against the Swiss-Prot protein database containing mouse (16,642 entries as of September 2012) or human (20,306 entries as of June 2014) sequences, with tryptic restriction and mass deviations of 10 parts per million/0.5 daltons in the respective MS modes. Oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, and other known collagen and proteoglycan modifications were used as variable modifications. Peptide false discovery rate was adjusted to 1%. For label-free quantification of differentially expressed proteins, normalized abundance of each protein was determined by measuring the peak area intensity utilizing the Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Briefly, protein abundance was calculated from the sum of all unique peptide ion abundances for a specific protein on each run. Normalization of abundance was performed to allow comparisons across different sample runs by the software. Proteins identified by more than one peptide were retained. The normalized peptide intensities for each sample were used to calculate fold change ratios for proteins between sample groups.

### Publication Abstract
Dissemination of primary tumors to distant anatomical sites has a substantial negative impact on patient prognosis. The liver is a common site for metastases from colorectal cancer, and patients with hepatic metastases have generally much shorter survival, raising a need to develop and implement novel strategies for targeting metastatic disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a meshwork of highly crosslinked, insoluble high-molecular-mass proteins maintaining tissue integrity and establishing cell-cell interactions. Emerging evidence identifies the importance of the ECM in cancer cell migration, invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. Here, we isolated the ECM from MC38 mouse liver metastases using our optimized method of mild detergent solubilization followed by biochemical enrichment. The matrices were subjected to label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, revealing proteins highly abundant in the metastatic matrisome. The resulting list of proteins upregulated in the ECM significantly predicted survival in patients with colorectal cancer but not other cancers with strong involvement of the ECM component. One of the proteins upregulated in liver metastatic ECM, annexin A1, was not previously studied in the context of cancer-associated matrisome. Here, we show that annexin A1 was markedly upregulated in colon cancer cell lines compared with cancer cells of other origin and also over-represented in human primary colorectal lesions, as well as hepatic metastases, compared with their adjacent healthy tissue counterparts. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive ECM characterization of MC38 experimental liver metastases and proposes annexin A1 as a putative target for this disease.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Here, the authors provide an extensive proteomics characterization of murine colorectal cancer liver metastasis matrisome (the ensemble of all extracellular matrix molecules). The findings presented in this study may enable identification of therapeutic targets or biomarkers of hepatic metastases.
