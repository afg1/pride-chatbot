### Title
Antagonistic interactions between benzo[a]pyrene and C60 in toxicological response of Marine Mussel

### Description
his integrated study aimed to assess the ecotoxicological effects of the interaction of fullerene (C60) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. The uptake of nC60, B[a]P and mixtures of nC60 and B[a]P into mussel tissues was confirmed by GC-MS, LC-HRMS and ICP-MS. Biomarkers of DNA damage as well as proteomics analysis were applied to unravel the toxic effect of B[a]P and C60. Antagonistic responses were observed at the genotoxic and proteomic level. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were only identified in the B[a]P single exposure and the B[a]P mixture exposure groups containing 1 mg/L of C60, the majority of which were down-regulated (~52 %). No DEPs were identified at any of the concentrations of nC60 (p < 0.05, 1 % FDR). Using DEPs identified at a threshold of (p < 0.05; B[a]P and B[a]P mixture with nC60), gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were enriched with a broad spectrum of biological processes and pathways, including those broadly associated with protein processing, cellular processes and environmental information processing. Among those significantly enriched pathways, the ribosome was consistently the top enriched term irrespective of treatment or concentration and plays an important role as the site of biological protein synthesis and translation. Our results demonstrate the complex multi-modal response to environmental stressors in M. galloprovincialis.

### Sample Protocol
Equal amounts of intestinal protein (100 ������������������������������������������������������g) were processed using the Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method. The digested proteins were subsequently purified using the STAGE tip procedure. Tryptic peptides were separated on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano flow system (Dionex, Camberly, UK). The sample was ionized in positive ion mode using a Proxeon nano spray ESI source (Thermo Fisher Hemel UK) and analyzed in an Orbitrap Velos Pro FTMS (Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany).  The Orbitrap Velos Pro instrument underXcalibur 2.1 software was operated in the data dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. MS spectra of intact peptides (m/z 350 - 1600) with an automated gain control accumulation target value of 1000000 ions were acquired with a resolution of 30000. The ten most intense ions were sequentially isolated and fragmented in the linear ion trap by collision induced dissociation (CID) at a target value of 10,000 or maximum ion time of 200 ms in rapid CID mode. A dynamic exclusion of ions previously sequenced within 45��������������������������������������������������������������������������������� was applied. All the singly charged and unassigned charge state ions were excluded from sequencing.

### Data Protocol
Samples were analysed using MS-GF+ via the R bioconductor package with the protein database utilised in this study consisting of the UniProt KnowledgeBase (KB) sequences from all organisms from the taxa Mollusca, sub category Bivalvia (84,410 sequences released 1/10/2018). This was cocatenated with a common contaminants list downloaded from ftp://ftp.thegpm.org/f asta/cRAP (Version: January 30th, 2015) using the R package seqRFLP. Searches were carried out using the following criteria: mass tolerance of 10 ppm, trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme, maximum number of clevage sites = 2 and cysteine carbamidomethylation and oxidation as a fixed modification. Target decoy approach (TDA) was applied with a 0.1 % peptide FDR threshold applied. A 1 % protein FDR was applied after protein identification (via aggregation). The resulting .mzid files were converted to MSnSet and quantified using label free spectral counts.
