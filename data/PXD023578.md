### Title
ELMO1 signaling is a promoter of osteoclast function and bone loss

### Description
Osteoporosis and bone fractures affect millions of men and women worldwide and are often due to increased bone resorption (bone loss) mediated by osteoclasts. Here, we identify a novel role for the cytoplasmic protein ELMO1 as an important ‘signaling node’ controlling the bone resorption function of osteoclasts. Initially, we noted association of ELMO1 SNPs with bone abnormalities and altered bone density in humans. Experimentally, ELMO1 emerged as a promoter of bone loss wherein deletion of ELMO1 reversed osteoporosis / bone erosions in four in vivo mouse models: osteoprotegerin deficiency, ovariectomy, and two types of inflammatory arthritis. However, ELMO1 did not promote bone loss under homeostatic conditions. Mechanistic studies pointed to a larger ELMO1 signaling network that regulates osteoclast activity at several levels. First, transcriptomics coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic deletion approaches identified new regulators of osteoclast function associated with Elmo1. Second, defining the ‘ELMO1 interactome’ in osteoclasts via proteomics revealed proteins linked to bone degradation. Third, ELMO1 affects the formation of the actin ring /sealing zone on bone-like surfaces and the distribution of osteoclast-specific proteases. Finally, a 3D structure-based inhibitory peptide targeting a highly conserved region of ELMO1 reduced bone resorption in wild type osteoclasts. Collectively, these data identify ELMO1 as a signaling hub that regulates osteoclast function and bone loss, with relevance to diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis.

### Sample Protocol
Elmo1+/+ and Elmo1–/– osteoclasts were labeled with EZ-LinkTM NHS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher) following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell extracts were prepared in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors cocktail (Calbiochem), 1 mM PMSF and 5 mM sodium orthovanadate) for 1h on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,200 rpm. ELMO1 was immunoprecipitated using the mouse anti-ELMO1 monoclonal antibody (Brugnera et al., 2002) and Protein A agarose beads (Amersham), and immune complexes were washed and split into two parts. One part was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The second part was heated for 5 min at 95 C and the agarose beads were removed by centrifugation. Biotinilated proteins in the remaining immunoprecipitate were enriched by pulldown with NeutrAvidinTM agarose (Pierce, following manufacturer’s instructions) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with SimplyBlue Safe stain (Invitrogen) and destained with water. The gel bands were excised and frozen at -80 °C. After drying in a vacuum centrifuge, the gel bands were digested with 100 L of trypsin (Promega) (20 g/mL) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digested peptides were extracted with 100 L 70% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid in a sonication bath. Each peptide sample was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 16 L 0.1% TFA.  Each gel band digest was analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) (Easy-nLC1000, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) coupled online with a an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), samples were loaded on a C18 nano trap column, (Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 2 cm, nanoViper, Thermo Scientific) and resolved on a C18 Easy-Spray column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18, 2 m, 100 Å, 75 m x 500 mm, nanoViper, Thermo Scientific) with a linear gradient of 2% mobile phase B (95 % acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) to 32% mobile phase B within 60 min at a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min.  The C18 Easy-Spray column was heated at 50 °C during the analysis. The most intense molecular ions in each MS scan within 3s were sequentially selected for high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using a normalized collision energy of 35%. The mass spectra were acquired at the mass range of m/z 400-1600. The Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific) capillary voltage and temperature were set at 1.9 kV and 275 °C, respectively. Dynamic exclusion (30 s) was enabled during the MS/MS data acquisition to minimize redundant peptide fragmentation events. The RF lens was set to 30% during the MS analysis and both MS1 and MS2 spectra were collected in profile mode.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched against a Swiss-Prot human protein database (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) using Proteome Discoverer (v.2.1.1.21, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via Mascot (v. 2.5.1, Matrix Science Inc.) with the automatic decoy search option set followed by false-discovery rate (FDR) processing by Percolator. Data was searched with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.05 Da, a maximum of two tryptic miscleavages and dynamic modifications for oxidation (15.9949 Da) on methionine residues. Resulting peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were filtered using an FDR of ≤ 1% (Percolator q-value ≤ 0.01).

### Publication Abstract
Osteoporosis affects millions worldwide and is often caused by osteoclast induced bone loss. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic protein ELMO1 as an important 'signaling node' in osteoclasts. We note that ELMO1 SNPs associate with bone abnormalities in humans, and that ELMO1 deletion in mice reduces bone loss in four in vivo models: osteoprotegerin deficiency, ovariectomy, and two types of inflammatory arthritis. Our transcriptomic analyses coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic deletion identify Elmo1 associated regulators of osteoclast function, including cathepsin G and myeloperoxidase. Further, we define the 'ELMO1 interactome' in osteoclasts via proteomics and reveal proteins required for bone degradation. ELMO1 also contributes to osteoclast sealing zone on bone-like surfaces and distribution of osteoclast-specific proteases. Finally, a 3D structure-based ELMO1 inhibitory peptide reduces bone resorption in wild type osteoclasts. Collectively, we identify ELMO1 as a signaling hub that regulates osteoclast function and bone loss, with relevance to osteoporosis and arthritis.
