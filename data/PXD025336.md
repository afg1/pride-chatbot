### Title
Global proteomics in MM.1S treated with pomalidomide or dipeptides

### Description
Global proteomics of Multiple Myeloma cell line MM.1S treated with pomalidomide or cyclic imide dipeptides for 10 h. The samples were labeled with TMT-16pro.

### Sample Protocol
After reduction and alkylation, the cell lysates were acidified and digested with trypsin/Lys-C on S-trap micro. After elution, the peptides were labeled with TMT-16pro. The labeled peptides were fractionated to 20 fractions by following the protocol of Pierce High-pH Reverse-Phase Fractionation Kit. The first fraction was excluded from analysis. The dried samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and submitted for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The analysis was performed by Proteome Discoverer. The raw data were searched against SwissProt human protein database and the contaminant proteins using the Sequest HT algorithm. PSMs were filtered using a 1% FDR using Percolator. PSMs were filtered to PSMs in only one protein group with an isolation interference under 70%.
