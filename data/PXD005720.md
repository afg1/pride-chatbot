### Title
Reference dataset for EnCOUNTer tool development

### Description
Reference dataset used for the development of the EnCOUNTEr tool to both (i) score all characterized peptides using discriminant parameters to evidence mature protein N-termini and (ii) determine the N-terminus acetylation yield for the most reliable ones.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins extracted from A. thaliana Col. 0 seedling are used to perform N-terminus enrichment using SCX chromatography after d3-Acetylation of free N-termini and later analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Such approach usually combines a few acquisition files, i.e. 10 files related to each individual SCX fraction (1h analysis) and 6 files related to combined fractions.

### Data Protocol
Mascot Distiller was used to combined all acquisition files together for a unique processing event. The EnCOUNTer script is first used to extract data from the raw files followed by protein identification using the Mascot protein identification tool. Detailed data processing is described in the associated article
