### Description
Analysis of AKT1 inhibitor binding using HDX-MS

### Sample Protocol
HDX reactions comparing AKTDrLink apo to AKTDrLink +A-443654 or MK-2206, exchange was carried out in a 20ul reaction volume containing 15pmol of protein and a final inhibitor concentration of 1.5uM. Deuterium exchange was carried out by incubating 4ul of protein or protein-inhibitor solution in 16ul of D2O buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 94.2%D2O) for five timepoints (0.3 on ice, 3, 30, 300, & 3000 seconds) at 20oC for a final D2O percent of 74.5%.  Reactions were terminated by quenching the reaction with quench buffer (2M Guanidine HCl, 3% Formic Acid). Following the addition of quench buffer, the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. All conditions were done in independent triplicate. For HDX reactions comparing Akt3P and Akt3P +A-443654 or MK-2206, exchange was carried out in a 20µl reaction containing 8.9 picomoles of protein and a final inhibitor concentration of 2.2uM. To initiate hydrogen-deuterium exchange, 4.45µL of protein +\- inhibitor +1.55ul of lipid buffer (20mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100mM KCl) was incubated with 14µL of D2O buffer solution (10mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 94.2% D2O) for five time points (3s on ice, 3s, 30s, 300s, 3000s at room temperature) to give a final concentration of 66% D2O. Exchange was terminated by the addition of ice-cold acidic quench buffer at a final concentration 0.6M guanidine-HCl and 0.9% formic acid, and samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80°C. HDX reactions comparing Akt 3P with PIP3 to Akt3P with PIP3 and inhibitors were conducted in 20µl reaction volumes with a final Akt 3P concentration of 8.0 pmol. Three conditions were tested: Akt 3P with 5% PIP3 vesicles (20% cholesterol, 25% PC, 15% PS, 35% PE, 5% PIP3), Akt 3P with 5% PIP3 vesicles and 1.5mM final A-443654, and Akt 3P with 5% PIP3 vesicles and 2mM final MK-2206. The final lipid vesicle concentration for all conditions was 400µM. Exchange was carried out for four time points (3s, 30s, 300s and 3000s at room temperature). Prior to the addition of D2O, the 4ul of protein was incubated with 0.45ul of lipid vesicles for 2 minutes at room temperature. Hydrogen deuterium exchange was initiated by the addition of 15.5µl of D2O buffer solution (20mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 94.2% D2O) with 1.55ul of lipid to 4.45µl of the protein-lipid solution, to give a final concentration of 66% D2O. Exchange was terminated by the addition of ice-cold quench buffer and samples were frozen. All experiments were carried out in independent triplicate.

### Data Protocol
Protein samples were rapidly thawed and injected onto an integrated fluidics system containing a HDx-3 PAL liquid handling robot and climate-controlled chromatography system (LEAP Technologies), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system, as well as an Impact HD QTOF Mass spectrometer (Bruker). The protein was run over either one (at 10°C) or two (at 10°C and 2°C) immobilized pepsin columns (Applied Biosystems; Poroszyme Immobilized Pepsin Cartridge, 2.1 mm x 30 mm; Thermo-Fisher 2-3131-00; Trajan; ProDx protease column, 2.1 mm x 30 mm PDX.PP01-F32) at 200 mL/min for 3 minutes. The resulting peptides were collected and desalted on a C18 trap column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7mm column (2.1 x 5 mm); Waters 186003975). The trap was subsequently eluted in line with a C18 reverse-phase separation column (Acquity 1.7 mm particle, 100 x 1 mm2 C18 UPLC column, Waters 186002352), using a gradient of 5-36% B (Buffer A 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B 100% acetonitrile) over 16 minutes. Mass spectrometry experiments acquired over a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z using an electrospray ionization source operated at a temperature of 200C and a spray voltage of 4.5 kV. Peptides were identified from the non-deuterated samples of AktDrLink or Akt 3P using data-dependent acquisition following tandem MS/MS experiments (0.5 s precursor scan from 150-2000 m/z; twelve 0.25 s fragment scans from 150-2000 m/z). MS/MS datasets were analysed using PEAKS7 (PEAKS), and peptide identification was carried out by using a false discovery based approach, with a threshold set to 1% using a database of purified proteins and known contaminants. The search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass error 0.02 Da, charge states from 1-8, leading to a selection criterion of peptides that had a -10logP score of 21.7. HD-Examiner Software (Sierra Analytics) was used to automatically calculate the level of deuterium incorporation into each peptide. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, appropriate selection of isotopic distribution, etc. Deuteration levels were calculated using the centroid of the experimental isotope clusters. Results are presented as relative levels of deuterium incorporation and the only control for back exchange was the level of deuterium present in the buffer (74.5% and 66%). Differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria:  ≥4.5% change in exchange, ≥0.45 Da difference in exchange, and a p value <0.01 using a two tailed student t-test.

### Publication Abstract
Akt is a master regulator of pro-growth signaling in the cell. Akt is activated by phosphoinositides that disrupt the autoinhibitory interface between the kinase and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and then is phosphorylated at T308 and S473. Akt hyperactivation is oncogenic, which has spurred development of potent and selective inhibitors as therapeutics. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we interrogated the conformational changes upon binding Akt ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors. We compared inhibitors against three different states of Akt1. The allosteric inhibitor caused substantive conformational changes and restricts membrane binding. ATP-competitive inhibitors caused extensive allosteric conformational changes, altering the autoinhibitory interface and leading to increased membrane binding, suggesting that the PH domain is more accessible for membrane binding. This work provides unique insight into the autoinhibitory conformation of the PH and kinase domain and conformational changes induced by Akt inhibitors and has important implications for the design of Akt targeted therapeutics.
