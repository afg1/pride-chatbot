### Title
Global view of the RAF-MEK-ERK module and its immediate downstream effectors

### Description
Small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK have proven effective at inhibiting tumor growth in melanoma patients, however this efficacy is limited due to the almost universal development of drug resistance. To provide advanced insight into the signaling responses that occur following kinase inhibition we have performed quantitative (phospho)-proteomics of human melanoma cells treated with either Dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor; Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor or SCH772984, an ERK inhibitor. Over nine experiments we identified 7827 class I phosphosites on 4960 proteins. This included 54 phosphorylation sites that were significantly down-modulated after exposure to all three inhibitors, 34 of which have not been previously reported. Functional analysis of these novel ERK targets identified roles for them in GTPase activity and regulation, apoptosis and cell-cell adhesion. Comparison of the results presented here with previously reported phosphorylation sites downstream of ERK showed a limited degree of overlap suggesting that ERK signaling responses may be highly cell line and cue specific. In addition we identified 26 phosphorylation sites that were only responsive to Dabrafenib. We provide further orthogonal experimental evidence for 3 of these sites in human embryonic kidney cells over-expressing BRAF as well as further computational insights using KinomeXplorer. The validated phosphorylation sites were found to be involved in actin regulation, which has been proposed as a novel mechanism for inhibiting resistance development. These results would suggest that the linearity of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway is at least context dependent.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were washed twice with 2ml of phosphate buffered saline before the addition of 1ml of RIPA lysis buffer. Cells were then sonicated in three 10 second bursts with an amplitude of 40% and then centrifuged at 4400g for 20 minutes at 4°C. Following centrifugation the supernatant was decanted into a clean tube and the precipitate discarded, 40ml of acetone was then added to the supernatant and incubated at -20°C overnight. Then samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes at 4°C, the supernatant was then discarded and the precipitate dissolved in 6ml of urea buffer. The sample was incubated at room temperature on a rotating platform until all protein had dissolved. 8mg of heavy SILAC labelled sample was mixed with 8mg of light and 8mg of medium SILAC labelled samples. Dithiothritol was added to mixed sample at 1 in 1000 dilution and incubated for 1 hour on a rotating platform at room temperature. CAA was then added at 1 in 100 dilution and incubated for 1 hour on a rotating platform at room temperature. Following this 240μl of Lys-C protease was added to the sample and incubated for 4 hours on a rotating platform at room temperature. Samples were then diluted 4-fold in ammonium bicarbonate prior to the addition of 240μl of trypsin. Samples were then incubated overnight on a rotating platform at room temperature. Then trifluoroacetic acid was added to the sample to give a 2% final concentration, the pH of the sample below 2.5.The sample was then centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes and the supernatant decanted into a clean tube before being added to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) that had been prewashed with 5ml of acetonitrile and two 4ml washes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After sample loading the cartridge was washed three times with 6ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample was then eluted in two 2ml volumes of Sep-Pak elution buffer 1 and 2ml of Sep-Pak elution buffer 2.   Samples were then fractionated using strong cation exchange chromatography generating 32 fractions. Fractions 1 to 6, 7 to 11, 17 to 19, 20 to 25, 26 to 27 and 28 to 32 were pooled and, along with the individual fractions 12 to 16, 1.5mg of titanium dioxide beads in 6μl DHB buffer were added. Samples were mixed with the titanium beads for 30 minutes on a rotating platform before being centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes. The supernatant from fractions 1 to 6 and 7 to 11, fractions 12 to 14 and fractions 15 to 16 were decanted into a new tube and an additional 1.5mg of titanium dioxide beads added and mixed for 30 minutes on a rotating platform. The supernatant from fractions 1 to 6 and 7 to 11 were decanted into a new tube with an additional 1.5mg of titanium dioxide beads and mixed again for 30 minutes on a rotating platform. In total this generated 15 titanium bead samples. Following mixing supernatant was discarded and the titanium beads resuspended in 100μl of SCX buffer B. Samples were then centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes, the supernatant aspirated and the beads resuspended in 100μl of buffer A* and B’ in 1:1 ratio. Samples were again centrifuged at 2000g for 5 minutes, supernatant discarded and the beads resuspended in 50μl of buffer B’. Suspended beads were transferred to a C8 stage tip and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 seconds. Samples were then eluted from the stage tips into a pcr microplate using 20μl of TiO2 elution buffer 1 and 20μl of TiO2 elution buffer 2 with the eluent from stage tips 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8 and 10 and 11 mixed to give a total of 11 samples. Volumes were normalised by the addition of 40μl of acidification buffer to wells containing eluent from only one stage tip. Plates were then spun in a centrifugal evaporator until 5-10μl of buffer remained, approximately 65 minutes. C18 stage tips were prepared by the addition of 20μl of methanol centrifuged through the tip at 1000g for 30 seconds. Stage tips were then washed with 20μl buffer B, 1000g for 30 seconds and 20μl of buffer A’, twice, again at 1000g for 30 seconds. Samples were resuspended in acidification buffer, 20μl for those containing a single eluent and 40μl for pooled eluents. Plates were centrifuged for 1 minute to condense the sample which was then transferred to the stage tip. Stage tips were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 1000g and repeated until all sample had passed through the stage tip. Samples were the washed by the addition of 20μl of buffer A to the stage tips, before centrifugation at 1000g for 30 seconds. This wash was then repeated a second time. Samples were then eluted from the stage tips into a pcr microplate using 20μl of buffer B for pooled samples and 40μl of buffer B for single samples. Eluent from stage tips 2 and 8, 3 and 4, 6 and 7 and 9 and 10 mixed to give a total of 7 samples. Plates were then spun in a centrifugal evaporator for 35 minutes before the addition of 4μl of buffer A*. Plates were then centrifuged for 1 minute to condense the sample and analysed on a ThermoFisher  Q Exactive mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry searches Raw files were processed using MaxQuant 1.5.0.2 with all searches conducted using an A375-specific database, where all protein sequence variants were included in addition to the reference, Ensemble version 68 human FASTA, sequences (see FASTA file generation for details). Methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation were set as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. False discovery rates were set to 1% and the ‘match between runs’ functionality was activated. The medium labeled super SILAC control was included in order to maximize SILAC ratio coverage, it was included in all searches but was not utilized for further analysis.  FASTA file generation A375 cells were grown to 80% confluence in T75 flasks. DNA was extracted from the cells using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit according to the manufacturers instructions. Sample was then sent to Beckman Coulter Genomics (now GENEWIZ) for sequencing. Target enrichment was performed using SureSelect whole exome version 5 and sequencing was performed using an Illumina system at 2x100 base pair reads, 89x average coverage with a minimum of 10x coverage at 95% of the sample.  Reads were filtered with Trimmomatic using the following parameters: headcrop = 3, minlen = 30, trailing = 3. Trimmed reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using the Burows-Wheeler Alignment tool before the application of the Genome Analysis Toolkit base quality score recalibration, indel realignment, duplicate removal, and SNP and INDEL discovery and genotyping across all samples simultaneously using standard hard filtering parameters according to Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices recommendations. The Ensembl Variant Predictor was used to predict the effect of the mutations on the protein sequence and those passing a high sensitivity filter (QD ≤ 1.5, FS ≥ 60, MQ ≥ 40, MQRankSum ≤ -12.5, ReadPosRankSum ≤ -8 and DP ≥ 5 per sample on average) were added to the search FASTA file.  Phosphorylation sites were assessed for significance using the limma FDR, a moderated t-test implemented in the limma package for Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org). Significance p-values obtained were corrected for multiple testing by the false-discovery method (45) and deemed significant at an FDR threshold of 0.1.
