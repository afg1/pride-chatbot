### Title
Human colorectal cancer cell LC-MS/MS

### Description
Six non- and drug-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines were selected in this study, which were non-resistant cell lines: HCT116 and LoVo, four drug-resistant cell lines: HCT116-OxPt, HCT116-SN38, LoVo-OxPt, LoVo-SN38.Proteins extraced from three HCT116 related cell lines were  labled and pooled together, and proteins from other three LoVo related cell lines were labled and pooled together.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were individually reduced with 10mM DTT and alkylated with 55mM IAM. 100ug of treated proteins from ecch cell line were digested using trypsin, at 37â„ƒ for 16h. The tryptic peptides in each group were individually labeled using iTRAQ reagents for 8-plex reagents following the iTRAQ manufacter's protocol.

### Data Protocol
The raw MS/MS data were converted into MGF format file by Proteome Discoerer 1.3, and were searched for peptides with MASCOT against the human Swiss-prot database.
