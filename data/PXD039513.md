### Title
Proteome changes in a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line during oxidative stress and following antioxidant treatment

### Description
Evaluation of the quantitative changes in Proteome caused by oxidative stress in the presence/absence of vitamin E compounds

### Sample Protocol
Cells were processed using Filter Aided Sample Preparation method (FASP), and carried through TMT labeling for quantitative proteomic analysis. Two experiments were completed, and technical replicates were also included in the LCMS data aacquisition.

### Data Protocol
Quantitation was done with isobaric Tandem Mass Tag labeling. Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography (mudpit) was done with offline fractionation (12, or 18 fractions) with subsequent online LCMS conducted on both QExactive (MS2) and Fusion Lumos (SPS-MS3) multinotch for reporter ion quantitation. Data was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.5, searching against human proteome (Uniprot UP000005640, with 77895 protein sequences, downloaded 6/28/2021)
