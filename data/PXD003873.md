TCA/Acetone precipitation of leaf proteins Resuspension in 7M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4%(w/v) CHAPS, 30mM Tris, pH 8.5

### Data Protocol
Data analysis using DeCyder 7.0, exported the normalized spot volumes, statistical testing using Excel, q-values derived by q-value library using R. MS data analysed using MASCOT v 2.3.02 with Percolator algorithm.

### Publication Abstract
The present study investigated Rhoeo discolor (L. Her.) Hance for its ability to accumulate Pb, which is of relevance to phytoremediation applications. Based on this analysis, plants were found to accumulate greater than 10 mg/g (0.1%) of dry weight Pb in the shoots, which classifies the plant a Pb hyperaccumulator. Further, changes in the leaf proteome profiles in response to Pb stress were investigated. Wild-type plants were subjected to a high concentration of Pb(NO<sub>3</sub> )<sub>2</sub> , and the levels of Pb that accumulated in different plant tissues were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Using 2D-difference gel electrophoresis, 181 protein spots were detected to be differentially abundant in response to Pb stress and selected spots exhibiting the strongest differential abundance suggested an impairment of the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant under Pb stress. Subsequently, a more extensive, proteome wide analysis utilizing label-free quantitation further identified a predominant decrease in protein levels and a significant effect on the nuclear proteome, as well as photosynthesis, carbon fixation and metabolism, providing insight into the Pb tolerance of this system in a potential phytoremediation context.
