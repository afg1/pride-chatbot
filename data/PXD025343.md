### Title
Mouse ESC LC-MSMS Ionising radiation

### Description
Dose-dependent (phospho) proteome responses of mouse embyronic stem cells to ionising radiation. Quantitative SILAC- and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments were performe at half an hour (0.5h) and four hours (4h) after exposure to LD (0.1 Gy) and high doses (HD; 1 Gy) of IR.

### Sample Protocol
Detailed sample processing protocol for proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments are described in the associated manuscript.

### Data Protocol
Detailed data processing protocol and bioinformatics methods are described in the associated manuscripts and datasets with identifier PXD013620.
