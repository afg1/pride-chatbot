### Title
An HDX-MS optimised approach to characterise nanobodies as tools for biochemical and structural studies

### Description
Given the far-reaching applications of nanobodies, a stream-lined approach to characterizing nanobodies tailored to its intended application is warranted. Camelids can produce a large number of antibodies that can bind to a host of epitopes spanning the entire protein of interest, making identification of binders appropriate to your study slow and cumbersome. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to rapidly characterize nanobody epitopes. HDX-MS is a technique that measures the rate of exchange of amide hydrogens in the protein backbone and can provide valuable insight into interaction surfaces with binding partners. Using the example of the lipid signalling complex PI3KÔÅß, we employed HDX-MS to characterize the epitopes of a large cohort of nanobodies simultaneously with reasonable accuracy. Some of these nanobodies proved to be extremely useful, stabilizing a flexible region in structural studies and blocking signalling inputs from activating partners in in-vitro kinase assays. These experiments were in turn, instrumental in obtaining the first high resolution structure of a PI3KÔÅß complex, besides providing novel tools to study PI3KÔÅß signalling in-vivo.

### Sample Protocol
HDX was performed by incubating either p110ùõæ, p110ùõæ/p101, or p110ùõæ/p84 and a nanobody for 2 minutes. The reaction was carried out at two time points (3 and 300 seconds) at 20 ÃäC in singlicate in a 50 ul reaction volume. The final concentrations of p110ùõæ (with or without regulatory subunits) and nanobody were 20 pmol and 30 pmol, respectively. D2O buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 96% D2O) was added to the protein samples to initiate hydrogen-deuterium exchange (final 84.5% D2O) and the reaction was quenched with an acidic quench solution (0.6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.9% formic acid final). The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80ÀöC.  Determining the binding interface between p110ùõæ/p101 and nanobodies. HDX was performed by incubating p110ùõæ/p101 and a nanobody for 2 minutes. The reaction was carried out at two times points (3 and 300 seconds) at 20 ÃäC in triplicate in a 50 ul reaction volume. The final concentrations of p110ùõæ/p101 and nanobody were 7.2 pmol and 15.7 pmol, respectively. D2O buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 96% D2O) was added to the protein samples to initiate hydrogen-deuterium (final 86.8% D2O) and the reaction was quenched with acidic quench solution (0.6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.9% formic acid final). The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80ÀöC.  Protein samples were rapidly thawed and injected onto an integrated fluidics system containing a HDx-3 PAL liquid handling robot and climate-controlled chromatography system (LEAP Technologies), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system, as well as an Impact HD QTOF Mass spectrometer (Bruker). The protein was run over either one (at 10¬∞C) or two (at 10¬∞C and 2¬∞C) immobilized pepsin columns (Applied Biosystems; Poroszyme Immobilized Pepsin Cartridge, 2.1 mm x 30 mm; Thermo-Fisher 2-3131-00; Trajan; ProDx protease column, 2.1 mm x 30 mm PDX.PP01-F32) at 200 mL/min for 3 minutes. The resulting peptides were collected and desalted on a C18 trap column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7mm column (2.1 x 5 mm); Waters 186003975). The trap was subsequently eluted in line with a C18 reverse-phase separation column (Acquity 1.7 mm particle, 100 x 1 mm2 C18 UPLC column, Waters 186002352), using a gradient of 5-36% B (Buffer A 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B 100% acetonitrile) over 16 minutes. Mass spectrometry experiments acquired over a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z using an electrospray ionization source operated at a temperature of 200C and a spray voltage of 4.5 kV.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified from the non-deuterated samples of p110Œ≥ alone or p110Œ≥ complexed with p101 or p84 using data-dependent acquisition following tandem MS/MS experiments (0.5 s precursor scan from 150-2000 m/z; twelve 0.25 s fragment scans from 150-2000 m/z). MS/MS datasets were analysed using PEAKS7 (PEAKS), and peptide identification was carried out by using a false discovery based approach, with a threshold set to 1% using a database of purified proteins and known contaminants. The search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass error 0.02 Da, charge states from 1-8, leading to a selection criterion of peptides that had a -10logP score of 21.7. HD-Examiner Software (Sierra Analytics) was used to automatically calculate the level of deuterium incorporation into each peptide. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, appropriate selection of isotopic distribution, etc. Deuteration levels were calculated using the centroid of the experimental isotope clusters. Results are presented as relative levels of deuterium incorporation, with the only correction being applied correcting for the deuterium oxide percentage of the buffer utilized in the exchange (84.5% and 86.8%). Differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria: : ‚â•5% change in exchange, ‚â•0.4 Da difference in exchange, and a p value <0.01 using a two tailed student t-test (for the triplicate experiment). The raw HDX data are shown in two different formats. The raw peptide deuterium incorporation graphs for a selection of peptides with significant differences are shown in Fig XX, with the raw data for all analyzed peptides in the source data. To allow for visualization of differences across all peptides, we utilized number of deuteron difference (#D) plots (Fig XX). These plots show the total difference in deuterium incorporation over the entire H/D exchange time course, with each point indicating a single peptide. Samples were only compared within a single experiment and were never compared to experiments completed at a different time with a different final D2O level.

### Publication Abstract
There is considerable interest in developing antibodies as modulators of signaling pathways. One of the most important signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which plays fundamental roles in growth, metabolism, and immunity. The class IB PI3K, PI3K&#x3b3;, is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic p110&#x3b3; subunit bound to a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit. PI3K&#x3b3; is a critical component in multiple immune signaling processes and is dependent on activation by Ras and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate its cellular roles. Here we describe the rapid and efficient characterization of multiple PI3K&#x3b3; binding single-chain camelid nanobodies using hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) for structural and biochemical studies. We identify nanobodies that stimulated lipid kinase activity, block Ras activation, and specifically inhibited p101-mediated GPCR activation. Overall, our work reveals insight into PI3K&#x3b3; regulation and identifies sites that may be exploited for therapeutic development.
