### Title
HipSci project pilot submission for 18 IPS cell lines

### Description
The Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci) is generating a large, high-quality reference panel of human IPSC lines. This is a pilot submission of mass-spectrometry analyses from 18 induced pluripotent stem cell lines generated by the HipSci project. This submission includes also data for two embryonic stem cell lines, and one reference sample comprising a mixture of 42 IPSC lines.

### Sample Protocol
The frozen iPS cell pellets were solubilized using lysis buffer (8M urea, 100 mM TEAB). The cell lysates were digested using a two-step digestion protocol (overnight Lys-C digestion followed by 4 hour-tryptic digestion). Strong Anion eXchange (SAX) chromotography was used to fractionate the peptides for subsequent LC-MS/MS analyses.

### Data Protocol
Proteomics analyses were performed using Q-exactive mass spectrometer and the data processing were carried out using Maxquant version 1.3.0.5. Data were processed with the following settings: 2 missed cleavages allowed, enzyme used was trypsin/P, 20 ppm tolerance was used for fragment ions, FDR cut off of 0.5 was used. One fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (Cys), and few variable modifications were selected: Oxidation (M); Acetylation (N-term), deamidation (NQ), pyroglutamate conversion of glutamine.

### Publication Abstract
Technology utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterization of many existing iPS cell lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPS cell lines derived from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative. Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPS cells and establishes their suitability as models of complex human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the variation in different iPS cell phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of genomic copy-number alterations that are repeatedly observed in iPS cells. In addition, we present a comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of human pluripotent cells.
