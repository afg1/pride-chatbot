### Title
Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes: Human, Cell paper 2012: MOCK

### Description
By combining extensive biochemical fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, we directly examined the composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse animal models. The project has been jointly supervised by Andrew Emili and Edward M. Marcotte. Project website: http://metazoa.med.utoronto.ca

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cells were grown to 70%â€“80% confluency in 75cm2 flasks and harvested by mechanical scraping. Cells were washed in icecold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation (600xg), and resuspended in lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set I (Calbiochem)]. Cells were lysed on ice using a Dounce homogenizer and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions using a protocol adapted from previous publication (Andersen et al., 2002). Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 1000xg for 5 min (4 oC). The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mM sucrose/10 mM MgCl2/1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, layered over a sucrose cushion of 880 mM sucrose/0.5 mM MgCl2/1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and centrifuged at 3000xg for 10 min (4 oC). The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer with 5% NP-40 by sonicating water bath (15 min). Following sonication, samples were centrifuged at 3,500xg for 10 min to pellet insoluble material, with the supernatant saved as the nuclear fraction.Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were further fractionatedin solution by isoelectric focusing, sucrose density gradient or ion exchange liqid chromatography. protein fractions were precipitated, resuspended and digested in solution with trypsin, dried and re-solubilised before being analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a nanoflow HPLC System (EASY-nLC; Proxeon) coupled to LTQ or LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher).

### Data Protocol
FASTA file was downloaded as described in the manuscript and processed to retain only the longest sequence for each gene, to simplify orthology mapping between species, as the project was focused on conserved complexes. Samples were searched using 3 search engines: Tide, INSPECT, and MSGFDB and combined to create quantification using MSblender (Kwon, Choi et. al. J. Proteome Research 2011). Tide search output is provided in a form processed for best hits with MSblender; MSGFDB and INSPECT search output is provided directly, when available.

### Publication Abstract
Our analysis examines the conservation of multiprotein complexes among metazoa through use of high resolution biochemical fractionation and precision mass spectrometry applied to soluble cell extracts from 5 representative model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and Homo sapiens. The interaction network obtained from the data was validated globally in 4 distant species (Xenopus laevis, Nematostella vectensis, Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and locally by targeted affinity-purification experiments. Here we provide details of our massive set of supporting biochemical fractionation data available via ProteomeXchange (PXD002319-PXD002328), PPIs via BioGRID (185267); and interaction network projections via (http://metazoa.med.utoronto.ca) made fully accessible to allow further exploration. The datasets here are related to the research article on metazoan macromolecular complexes in Nature [1].
