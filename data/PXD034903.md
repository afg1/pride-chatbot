### Title
Analysis of H. kunzii H13 under conditions that mimic the wound environment

### Description
Analysis of exoproteome and proteome of H. kunzii H13 at exponential and stationary phase of growth

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were assigned to taxa using in house scripts using NCBI references, with spectral counts as taxon abundance proxy.
