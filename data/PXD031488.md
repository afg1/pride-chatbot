### Title
Profiling the anandamide reuptake inhibitor WOBE437

### Description
Anandamide, or N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), is a signaling lipid that modulates neurotransmitter release via activation of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) in the brain. Termination of anandamide signaling is thought to be mediated via a facilitated cellular reuptake process utilizing an unknown transporter protein. Recently, WOBE437 has been reported as a novel, natural product-based inhibitor of AEA reuptake that is active in cellular and in vivo models. To profile its target interaction landscape, we synthesized pac-WOBE, a photoactivatable probe derivative of WOBE437, and performed chemical proteomics in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. Surprisingly, WOBE437, but not OMDM-1, was found to increase AEA uptake in Neuro-2a cells. In line, WOBE437 reduced cellular levels of AEA and related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Using pac-WOBE, we identified saccharopine dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (SCCPDH), vesicle amine transport 1 (VAT1) and ferrochelatase (FECH) as WOBE437-interacting proteins in Neuro-2a cells

### Sample Protocol
The protein interaction landscape of WOBE437 was investigated by using a photoaffinity probe derivative. Several inhibitors including WOBE437 were incubated with mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells in serum-free medium for 30 minutes, after which probe was added for another 30 minutes. Crosslinking was effected by UV-irradiation (λ = 350 nm, 10 min) using a CaproBox, which irradiated the cells with simultaneous cooling at 4 °C to counteract the heat induced by the irradiation. Next, the cells were harvested, lysed and subjected to copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, “click”-reaction) conditions utilizing biotin-N3, and the resulting biotin-labeled proteins were  enriched using streptavidin-coated beads, digested using trypsin and the resulting tryptic peptides analyzed by LC-MS using a Synapt G2-Si instrument.

### Data Protocol
The data processing was performed with the commercial software Progenesis QI, which resulted in the identification and quantification 3 WOBE437 targets in Neuro-2a cells.

### Publication Abstract
Anandamide or <i>N</i>-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) is a signaling lipid that modulates neurotransmitter release via activation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) in the brain. Termination of anandamide signaling is thought to be mediated <i>via</i> a facilitated cellular reuptake process that utilizes a purported transporter protein. Recently, WOBE437 has been reported as a novel, natural product-based inhibitor of AEA reuptake that is active in cellular and <i>in vivo</i> models. To profile its target interaction landscape, we synthesized pac-WOBE, a photoactivatable probe derivative of WOBE437, and performed chemical proteomics in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. Surprisingly WOBE437, unlike the widely used selective inhibitor of AEA uptake OMDM-1, was found to increase AEA uptake in Neuro-2a cells. In line with this, WOBE437 reduced the cellular levels of AEA and related <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Using pac-WOBE, we identified saccharopine dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (SCCPDH), vesicle amine transport 1 (VAT1), and ferrochelatase (FECH) as WOBE437-interacting proteins in Neuro-2a cells. Further genetic studies indicated that SCCPDH and VAT1 were not responsible for the WOBE437-induced reduction in NAE levels. Regardless of the precise mechanism of action of WOB437 in AEA transport, we have identified SSCPHD, VAT1, and FECH as unprecedented off-targets of this molecule which should be taken into account when interpreting its cellular and <i>in vivo</i> effects.
