### Title
Age-dependent changes in the sarkosyl-insoluble proteome of the APPswe/PS1de9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease implicate dysfunctional mitochondria in disease pathogenesis

### Description
This study was designed to identify and quantify pre-fibrillary proteins enriched by their insolubility in the detergent sarkosyl. Sarkosyl insoluble fractions were isolated from the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and littermate wild type mice to identify protein aggregates involved in disease pathogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were prepared by the Greenberg and Davies protocol for paired helical filaments (1990) and protein extracts from 3 brains were pooled to gain enough material for LC-MS/MS. Proteins were denatured in 8M urea, 10mM DTT, alkylated, digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Samples were labelled with iTRAQ-4plex labels. samples were combined and off-line fractionated by HILIC. fractions were run on an orbitrap fusion lumos mass spectrometer operating in positive mode using data-dependent acquisition. Top 12 peptide ions were selected for fragmentation

### Data Protocol
Raw data was searched against mus musculus reference database from swissprot and uniprot via Mascot (v2.3.02, Matrix Science) and Sequest HT search engines using Proteome Discoverer (v2.1, Thermo Fisher). Precursor masstolerance: 10ppm, product ion mass tolerance: 0.02Da. Fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation (cys) and iTRAQ-4plex labels (lys, N-termini), FDR:0.01,
