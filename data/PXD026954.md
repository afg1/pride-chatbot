### Title
dynamic proteomics of mesenchymal stem cells in critical limb ischemia

### Description
Mutant MetRS in MSCs allows efficient and specific identification of dynamic cell proteomics in situ, which reflect the functions and adaptive changes of MSCs that may be leveraged to understand and improve stem cell therapy in critical limb ischemia

### Sample Protocol
MetRSL274G MSCs was transplanted in sham or HLI hind limb. ANL-labeled proteins was isolated by click reaction and affinity purification. Then ANL-labeled proteins was detected by MS.

### Data Protocol
The XCalibur RAW files were collected in profile mode, centroided and converted to MzXML using ReAdW v. 3.5.1. The mgf files were then created using MzXML2 Search (included in TPP v. 3.5) for all scans. The data was searched using SEQUEST engine, which was set max Missed Cleavages of 5, fragment tolerance of 0.00Da, parent tolerance of 0.012Da and variable modifications was +16 on M (Oxidation), +57 on C (Carbamidomethyl). Searches were performed by blasting the raw data with the Uniref100 database.
