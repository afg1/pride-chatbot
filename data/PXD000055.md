### Title
Casein Kinase 1 functions in eukaryotic non-transcriptional time keeping

### Description
Proteomics section: 300ug of rotein extract from Ostreococcus tauri cells were reduced alkylated and trypsin digested. Phosphopeptide enrichment  done on a Titanium dioxide column.  LC-MS analysis performed on a cap-HPLC-MS (Orbitrap XL).  Data analysis: Data were searched using Mascot. Peptide quantitation performed with Progenesis. Position of the phosphorylated amino acid confirmed with Maxquant and manual validation.
