### Title
Characterization of pericardial fluid proteome through fractionation with magnetic nanoparticles (NPs@EDTA)

### Description
Despite the invasive nature of its collection, being in close contact to the heart, the pericardial fluid (PF) proteome reflects the pathophysiological status of this organ. Therefore, whenever it is available, e.g. on occasion of open-heart surgery, PF proteomic analysis can give important clues of the molecular mechanisms underlying heart disease and it may help uncover new diagnostic/prognostic markers as well as new therapeutic targets. Still, the characterization of its protein fraction is challenged by large amounts of albumin, that can be relatively higher than in plasma/serum. To help expand the PF catalogued to date and to validate the technique for future applications, we have fractionated and characterized the pericardial fluid, using N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA)-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (NPs@EDTA) followed by a GeLC-MS/MS approach. As compared to a traditional albumin and IgG-depletion kit, we found this method to be as efficient in removing albumin, with similar inter-individual proteome variability. Furthermore, the NPs@EDTA-based fractionation approach could expand the protein dynamic range and displayed good proteome reproducibility. Overall, 565 proteins were identified, with more than half being new assignments to PF proteome.

### Sample Protocol
3 samples were collected from patients during valve surgery. PF was centrifuged at 5000 rpm, 4 °C for 15’ and the supernatant stored at -80 °C until further processing. Protein quantification was estimated with the BCA method. Commercial method: 2 samples (600 μg of protein) were processed using an albumin/IgG-depletion kit (Pierce™), according to the manufacturer. To collect the albumin/IgG-rich fraction an additional incubation with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.4 (30’) and centrifugation for 2’ at 1000 × g was ensued.  NPs@EDTA-based fractionation: 1 mg of NPs@EDTA was washed with binding buffer [0.01 M 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 0.01 M NaCl, pH 6.5-8.5] and incubated with different amounts of PF from 2 individuals. For the saturation assay, increasing protein amounts were used (0.3-4.5 mg range). Incubation was performed for 1h (RT) by mechanical agitation. Supernatants were collected and 3 washing cycles (using binding buffer) were followed for 3-5’. Elution of beads-bound proteins was performed using Laemmli buffer by promoting further agitation (10’). SDS-PAGE: Except for the saturation assay (where the entire amount of proteins was used), 30 μg of protein was loaded onto 12.5% gels and separated under reducing and denaturant conditions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G250 and distained. In-gel digestion and peptide clean-up: Gel were cut in pieces and washed with 100 mM NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile (ACN). Proteins were reduced by incubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol (30’, 60 °C), alkylated in the dark with 55 mM iodoacetamide (30’, 25 °C) and washed again. Digestion was carried out overnight with trypsin (37 °C). Peptides were extracted with 10% formic acid (FA), followed by a 1:1 mixture with ACN and vacuum-dried. For sample clean-up, peptides mixture was resuspended in 5% ACN and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and purified using Pierce® C18 Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific).  Reproducibility assay: The third sample was processed in duplicate following the same NPs@EDTA-based procedure. 3 mg of protein was used (beads’ saturation limit). Elution of the bound proteins was carried out with 50 mM NH4HCO3 and 0.1% SDS. Protein identification: The first 2 samples were analyzed on a Triple TOF™ 5600 System (ABSciex®) in information-dependent acquisition (IDA). Peptides were resolved by liquid chromatography (LC, nanoLC Ultra 2D, Eksigent®) on a MicroLC column ChromXP™ C18CL (300 μm internal diameter (ID) × 15 cm length, 3 μm particles, 120 Å pore size, Eksigent®) at 5 μL/min with a multistep gradient: 0-2 min linear gradient 5-10%, 2-45 min linear gradient 10-30% and, 45-46 min to 35% of ACN in 0.1% FA. Peptides were ionized using an electrospray (DuoSpray™ Source, ABSciex®) with a 50 μm ID stainless steel emitter (NewObjective). For IDA experiments the mass spectrometer was set to scanning full spectra (350-1250 m/z) for 250 ms, followed by up to 100 MS/MS scans (100-1500 m/z from a dynamic accumulation time - minimum 30 ms for precursor above the intensity threshold of 1000 - to maintain a cycle time of 3.3 s). Candidate ions with a charge state between +2 and +5 and >10 counts/s were isolated for fragmentation and one MS/MS spectra was collected before adding those ions to the exclusion list for 25 s (mass spectrometer operated by Analyst® TF 1.7, ABSciex®). Rolling collision was used with a collision energy spread of 5. The peptide mixes from sample PF3 were analyzed using a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA) coupled to an EasyLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Proxeon), Odense, Denmark). Peptides were loaded onto the 2-cm Nano Trap column with an ID of 100 μm packed with 5 μm C18 particles (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were separated by reversed-phase LC using a 75 μm ID 25-cm column, packed with 1.9 μm C18 particles (Nikkyo Technos Co. Ltd. Japan). Chromatographic gradients started at 93% buffer A (0.1% FA in water) and 7% buffer B (0.1% FA in ACN) with a 250 nL/min flow rate for 5’ and gradually increased 65% buffer A and 35% buffer B in 120’. After each analysis, the column was washed for 15’ with 10% buffer A and 90% buffer B. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode and full MS scans with 1 micro scans at resolution of 60.000 were used over a mass range of m/z 350-2000 with detection in the Orbitrap. Auto gain control (AGC) was set to 1E6, dynamic exclusion (60 s) and charge state filtering disqualifying singly charged peptides was activated. In each cycle of DDA analysis, following each survey scan the top 20 most intense ions with multiple charged ions above a threshold ion count of 5000 were selected for fragmentation at normalized collision energy of 35%. Fragment ion spectra produced via collision-induced dissociation were acquired in the Ion Trap, AGC was set to 5e4, isolation window of 2.0 m/z, activation time of 0.1 ms and maximum injection time of 100 ms was set. Data were acquired with Xcalibur v2.2.

### Data Protocol
For the first 2 samples, peptide identification and library generation were performed with Protein Pilot software (v5.1, ABSciex®), using the following parameters: search against the SwissProt database (March 2016 release); iodoacetamide as cysteines alkylating agents as fixed modification; trypsin as digestion type. An independent False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis using the target-decoy approach provided with Protein Pilot software was used to assess the quality of the identifications and positive identifications were considered when identified proteins and peptides reached a 5% local FDR. Proteome Discoverer software suite (v1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Mascot search engine (v2.5, Matrix Science) were used for peptide identification in the third sample. Samples were searched against a SwissProt database containing entries corresponding to human, a list of common contaminants and all the corresponding decoy entries (20797 entries). Trypsin was chosen as enzyme and a maximum of 3 miscleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M) and acetylation (N-terminal) were used as variable modifications. Searches were performed using a peptide tolerance of 7 ppm, a product ion tolerance of 0.5 Da. Resulting data files were filtered for FDR <5%.

### Publication Abstract
Owing to their close proximity, pericardial fluid (PF)'s proteome may mirror the pathophysiological status of the heart. Despite this diagnosis potential, the knowledge of PF's proteome is scarce. Large amounts of albumin hamper the characterization of the least abundant proteins in PF. Aiming to expand PF's proteome and to validate the technique for future applications, we have fractionated and characterized the PF, using N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA)-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (NPs@EDTA) followed by a GeLC-MS/MS approach. Similarly to an albumin-depletion kit, NPs@EDTA-based fractionation was efficient in removing albumin. Both methods displayed comparable inter-individual variability, but NPs@EDTA outperformed the former with regard to the protein dynamic range as well as to the monitoring of biological processes. Overall, 565 proteins were identified, of which 297 (&gt;50%) have never been assigned to PF. Moreover, owing to this method's good proteome reproducibility, affordability, rapid automation and high binding ability of NP@EDTA, it bears a great potential towards future clinical application.
