### Title
TNF-alpha stimulated secretome of schizophrenia-sourced iPSC-derived astrocytes

### Description
Schizophrenia is a complex and severe neuropsychiatric disorder, with a wide range of debilitating symptoms. Several aspects of its multifactorial complexity are still unknown, and some are accepted to be an early developmental deficiency with a more specifically neurodevelopmental origin. ??Molecular and functional abnormalities in astrocytes play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes from schizophrenia patients were investigated regarding their proteome, inflammatory responses, and their secretome effect on vascularization. Proteomic analysis revealed alterations in proteins related to immune function and vascularization. Taken together, our results suggest that schizophrenia astrocytes are immunologically dysfunctional which might affect vascularization through secreted factors.

### Sample Protocol
Conditioned media were collected and concentrated (10x) using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters 3,000 MWCO (Merck-Milipore, Germany), recovered protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and protein digested in-gel with trypsin, after reduced by DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed in bidimensional nanoUPLCtandem nanoESI-HDMSE platform by multiplexed data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments.

### Data Protocol
We used Progenesis QI 3.0 for proteomics software for proper spectra processing and database searching conditions, packaged with Apex3D, peptide 3D, and ion accounting informatics (Waters). Proteins were processed by using dedicated algorithms and cross-matched with the Uniprot human proteome database, version 2018/09, with the default parameters for ion counting and quantitation. The following parameters were considered in identifying peptides: (1) digestion by trypsin allowing one missed cleavage; (2) methionine oxidation was considered a variable modification, and carbamidomethylation (C) a fixed modification; (3) false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1%.
