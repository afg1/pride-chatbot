### Title
Characterization of peptide-protein relationships in protein ambiguity groups via bipartite graphs - data set D3 (without and with isoforms)

### Description
Motivation: In bottom-up mass spectrometry proteins are enzymatically digested before measurement. The relationship between proteins and peptides can be represented by bipartite graphs that can be split into connected components. This representation is useful to aid protein inference and quantification, which is complex due to the occurrence of shared peptides. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of these bipartite graphs using peptides from an in silico digestion of protein databases as well as quantified peptides. Results: The graphs based on quantified peptides are smaller and have less complex structures compared to the database level. However, the proportion of protein nodes without unique peptides and the proportion of graphs that contain these proteins increase. Large differences between the different underlying organisms on database as well as quantitative level could be observed. Insights of this analysis may be useful for the development of protein inference and quantification algorithms. Link to preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.454128v1?ct=

### Sample Protocol
For details see the original publication from Cox et al. (PMID: 24942700).

### Data Protocol
Data set D3 is a re-analysis of a published ground-truth data set with two experimental groups. 60 μg of HeLa cell lysate was mixed with either 10 μg or 30 μg of E.coli lysate, each measured in three technical replicates [PMID: 24942700]. Raw files were taken from the PRIDE repository, identifier PXD000279, and re-analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.6.17.0 and Andromeda. Settings were set to 20 ppm precursor tolerance, 0.5 Da fragment tolerance, enzymes LysC and Trypsin and up to 2 allowed missed cleavages. For post-translational modifications (PTMs), Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) were set as variable and carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed. All other settings were left at their default values. The peptides.txt file was used for further processing of the quantitative peptide-level data. The database contains in total 81,709 canonical sequences and consists of the UniProt human reference proteome (77,027 entries), the E.Coli reference proteome (4,437 entries) ans the Andromeda contaminants database (245 entries). Additionally, we repeated this analysis including isoforms. The reference proteomes contain then 99,012 entries for human and 4,449 entries for E.Coli. Together with the contaminant sequences, 103,706 sequences in total are included in the analysis. This allows a direct analysis of the impact of including isoforms on the bipartite peptide-protein graphs.

### Publication Abstract
In bottom-up proteomics, proteins are enzymatically digested into peptides before measurement with mass spectrometry. The relationship between proteins and their corresponding peptides can be represented by bipartite graphs. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of bipartite graphs using quantified peptides from measured data sets as well as theoretical peptides from an in silico digestion of the corresponding complete taxonomic protein sequence databases. The aim of this study is to characterize and structure the different types of graphs that occur and to compare them between data sets. We observed a large influence of the accepted minimum peptide length during in silico digestion. When changing from theoretical peptides to measured ones, the graph structures are subject to two opposite effects. On the one hand, the graphs based on measured peptides are on average smaller and less complex compared to graphs using theoretical peptides. On the other hand, the proportion of protein nodes without unique peptides, which are a complicated case for protein inference and quantification, is considerably larger for measured data. Additionally, the proportion of graphs containing at least one protein node without unique peptides rises when going from database to quantitative level. The fraction of shared peptides and proteins without unique peptides as well as the complexity and size of the graphs highly depends on the data set and organism. Large differences between the structures of bipartite peptide-protein graphs have been observed between database and quantitative level as well as between analyzed species. In the analyzed measured data sets, the proportion of protein nodes without unique peptides ranged from 6.4% to 55.0%. This highlights the need for novel methods that can quantify proteins without unique peptides. The knowledge about the structure of the bipartite peptide-protein graphs gained in this study will be useful for the development of such algorithms.
