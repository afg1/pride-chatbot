### Title
Analysis of protein expression in the lung of mice infected with influenza virus(WSN)

### Description
In order to analysis the changes of protein expression and its influence on innate immune in mice lung after influenza virus infection,we detect protein expression profile by iTRAQ method

### Sample Protocol
C57B/6 wild type and knockout mice infected intranasally with influenza virus���WSN���or PBS for 24 hours, then take the lungs and each group has two repeats.

### Data Protocol
First step,extrction of protein from lung tissue. Second step, protein concentration was determined by Brandford methord. Third step, Trypsin enzymatic hydrolysis was performed on each sample. Fouth step, the peptide was labeled with iTRAQ reagent. Step 5,advisory separation by Strong Cation Exchange chrmatography. Step 6, Analysis by LC-MS

### Publication Abstract
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection regulates the expression of numerous host genes. However, the precise mechanism underlying implication of these genes in IAV pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we employed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) to identify host proteins regulated by IAV infection. iTRAQ analysis of mouse lungs infected or uninfected with IAV showed a total of 167 differentially upregulated proteins in response to the viral infection. Interestingly, we observed that p27Kip1, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was markedly induced by IAV both at mRNA and protein levels through in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, it was shown that innate immune signalling positively regulated p27Kip1 expression in response to IAV infection. Ectopic expression of p27Kip1 in A549 cells dramatically inhibited IAV replication, whereas, p27Kip1 knockdown significantly enhanced the virus replication. in vivo experiments demonstrated that p27Kip1 knockout (KO) mice were more susceptible to IAV than wild-type (WT) mice: exhibiting higher viral load in lung tissue, faster body-weight loss, reduced survival rate and more severe organ damage. Moreover, we found that p27Kip1 overexpression facilitated the degradation of viral NS1 protein, caused a dramatic STAT1 activation and promoted the expression of IFN-&#x3b2; and several critical antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Increased p27Kip1 expression also restricted infections of several other viruses. Conversely, IAV-infected p27Kip1 KO mice exhibited a sharp increase in NS1 protein accumulation, reduced level of STAT1 activation and decreased expression of IFN-&#x3b2; and the ISGs in the lung compared to WT animals. These findings reveal a key role of p27Kip1 in enhancing antiviral innate immunity.
