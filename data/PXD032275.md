### Title
monoclonal antibody NIST8671 LC-MS/MS

### Description
The characteristics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cohering various function effectors shows great expectation in therapy. Glycosylation, one of the common post-translational modifications, deeply influences the cohesion. It is necessary to grasp monosaccharide composition/sequence and glycan structures in mAbs. There have been comprehensive mass spectrometry characterization of N-glycosylation of mAbs, and monosaccharide compositions are deduced according to known biosynthetic rules. Our recently developed intact N-glycopeptide search engine GPSeeker has made unambiuous structure-specific characterization of N-glycosylation possible with structure-diagnostic fragment ions from selective fragmentattion of N-glycan moieties.

### Sample Protocol
denatured by 8M urea reduced by DTT digested by trypsin enriched using ZIC-HILIC

### Data Protocol
Intact N-glycopeptides were searched and identified by GPSeeker with maximal miss cleavage of one, mininal peptide length 6; the isotopic peak m/z deviation (IPMD), isotopic peak abundance cutoff (IPACO) and isotopic peak abundance deviation (IPAD) for both the precursor and fragment ions were 20 ppm, 40% and 50%, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
The characteristics of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cohering various function effectors show great expectation in therapy. Glycosylation, one of the common post-translational modifications, deeply influences cohesion. It is necessary to grasp monosaccharide composition/sequence and glycan structures in mAbs. There has been comprehensive mass spectrometry characterization of <i>N-</i>glycosylation of mAbs, and monosaccharide compositions are deduced according to known biosynthetic rules. Our recently developed intact <i>N-</i>glycopeptide search engine GPSeeker has made structure-specific characterization of <i>N-</i>glycosylation possible with structure-diagnostic fragment ions from selective fragmentation of <i>N-</i>glycan moieties. Here, we report our structure-specific <i>N-</i>glycoproteomics characterization of NIST monoclonal antibody reference material 8671 using GPSeeker, and 59 <i>N-</i>glycan structures (including 16 pairs of isomers) are characterized.
