### Title
Forward and reverse degradomics defines the proteolytic landscape of human knee osteoarthritic cartilage and the role of the serine protease HtrA1

### Description
Proteolytic destruction of articular cartilage is a major pathogenic mechanism in osteoarthritis (OA), but was not previously investigated on a proteome-wide scale. We sought to define the human knee OA cartilage degradome.

### Sample Protocol
Cartilage proteins isolated from OA cartilage were labeled by reductive dimethylation, followed by trypsin digestion, enrichment of N-terminally labeled/blocked peptides, tandem mass spectrometry and positional annotation to identify cleavages

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometer .raw files were imported into Proteome Discoverer 2.3 (PD 2.3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Analysis parameters were set as precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Static modification was set as carbamidomethyl (C), whereas dynamic modifications included the light (30.03 Da) dimethyl formaldehyde (N-terminal, K), oxidation (M, P), deamidation (N, R), acetylation (N-terminal), and Gln to pyro-Glu N-terminal. The human database with isoforms was downloaded on 10/01/2018 from Uniprot containing 20332 sequences. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated by creating a decoy database using percolator node from PD 2.3 and a strict cutoff was applied at 1% FDR
