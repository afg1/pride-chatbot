### Title
DIA proteomics on mouse tissue to investigate the GAPDH redox switch

### Description
The glycolytic enzyme GAPDH is equipped with a redox switch that rapidly and reversibly inactivates the enzyme in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The physiological implications of the redox switch were investigated in C57BL/6NTac wildtype and GAPDH(T175A) knock-in mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

### Sample Protocol
Fresh frozen heart tissue was ground prior to sonication (Braun Dismembrator, cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, 2500 rpm, 30 s). Kidney tissue was fresh frozen without further treatment. Approx. 5 mg of tissue was transferred to AFA tubes (Covaris, PN 520292) and filled to 70 µl with RIPA buffer suplemented with 1% SDS. Proteins were extracted and DNA sheared (Covaris LE220Rsc: PIP 350 W, DF 25%, CPB 200, 300 s pulse, two repeats, 20 °C). Protein (25 µg) was used for SP3 protein preparation on a Biomek i7 workstation with single-step reduction and alkylation. Briefly, 16.6 µl reduction and alkylation buffer (40 mM TCEP, 160 mM CAA, 200 mM ABC) was added, and samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 C and cooled to room temperature. Proteins were bound to 2.5 µg of paramagnetic beads (1:1 ratio of hydrophylic/hydrophobic beads) by adding acetonitrile to 50%. Samples were washed twice with 80% ethanol and once with 100% AcN, before reconstitution in 35 Ã‚Âµl of 100 mM ABC. Digestion was completed overnight at 37 °C using a trypsin/LysC enzyme mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a protein:enzyme ratio of 50:1 (w/w) and stopped with formic acid (0.1%). LCÃ¢â‚¬â€œMS analysis was conducted on an Evosep One system coupled to a Bruker TimsTOF PRO2 mass spectrometer. 500 ng of sample material was loaded on the Evotip according to the manufacturer's protocol. Liquid chromatography was carried out using the EVOSEP 15 SPD LC method (88 min gradient) with an EV1137 performance column (15 cm x 150 µm, 1.5  µm) at 40 °C coupled to a 10 µm Zero Dead Volume Captive Spray Emitter (Bruker #1865691). For acquisition in DIA-PASEF mode, the standard Bruker method for long gradients was applied.

### Data Protocol
The DIA-PASEF raw proteomics data was processed using DIA-NN 1.8 [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0638-x, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31492-0], using MS1 and MS2 mass accuracies of 15 ppm.  Searches were conducted using a DIA-NN in-silico generated library predicted from the mouse reference proteome (UP000000589, date: 2022-05-18) with match-between-runs (MBR) activated, retention time (RT) dependent normalization enabled, quantification set to Robust LC (high precision) mode and library generation set to IDs, RT and IM profiling mode.

### Publication Abstract
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is known to contain an active-site cysteine residue undergoing oxidation in response to hydrogen peroxide, leading to rapid inactivation of the enzyme. Here we show that human and mouse cells expressing a GAPDH mutant lacking this redox switch retain catalytic activity but are unable to stimulate the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and enhance their reductive capacity. Specifically, we find that anchorage-independent growth of cells and spheroids is limited by an elevation of endogenous peroxide levels and is largely dependent on a functional GAPDH redox switch. Likewise, tumour growth in vivo is limited by peroxide stress and suppressed when the GAPDH redox switch is disabled in tumour cells. The induction of additional intratumoural oxidative stress by chemo- or radiotherapy synergized with the deactivation of the GAPDH redox switch. Mice lacking the GAPDH redox switch exhibit altered fatty acid metabolism in kidney and heart, apparently in compensation for the lack of the redox switch. Together, our findings demonstrate the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of oxidative GAPDH inactivation in mammals.
