### Title
Absolute Quantitation of All Plasma Proteins from SWATH Data for Biomarker Discovery

### Description
The current state of proteomics requires a choice between targeted and discovery methods.  The former provides exceptional quantitation and data completeness, but only with few analytes.  Discovery proteomics can identify hundreds and thousands of proteins in a sample, but with poor quantitation and data completeness.  We have established and optimized a method that combines targeted and data-independent acquisition for absolute quantitation of all plasma proteins in a single sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ions (SWATH) acquisition run using a panel of spike-in standards (SIS).  We compared the absolute quantitation (AQ) of SWATH and high-resolution multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM-HR) acquisition methods using the 100 protein PlasmaDive SIS panel spiked into human plasma.  SWATH provided equivalent quantitation and differentially abundant protein profiles as MRM-HR.  Absolute quantities of the SIS peptides from the SWATH data were used to estimate the absolute quantities (eAQ) for all the proteins in the run.   The eAQ values provided similar quantitation and differentially abundant protein profiles as AQ and protein group (PG) values, and the eAQ method was the only scheme where all selected proteins were verified by MRM-HR.  We applied the eAQ method to a cohort of 16 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving immunotherapeutics and found that fibronectin (FN1) and proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) were useful markers for predicting patients who would stay on these agents for at least 6 months (area under the curve of 0.8438 and 0.6735, respectively).  Thirteen additional plasma samples confirmed that FN1 and PRG4 are putative biomarkers (positive predictive value is 100% and 85.7%, respectively) for a prolonged (>6 months) response to immunotherapeutic agents.  In conclusion, we describe an optimized method for absolute quantification of all proteins in a SWATH run, and this approach is amenable for the identification of plasma biomarkers.

### Sample Protocol
Plasma samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 20 min in a clinical centrifuge and aliquoted into 1.5 ml tubes and stored at -80oC until they were ready to be used.  Plasma samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis using the PlasmaDive mini kit (Biognosys) according to the provided protocol.  Briefly, ten microliters of plasma were denatured, reduced, and alkylated using the kit components.  Each alkylated sample was diluted 10 times and digested for three hours at 37oC with 2 Âµg of trypsin (Promega).  Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid, desalted with MicroSpin columns, dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, and stored at -20oC until mass spectrometry analysis.  Peptides were suspended in LC solution (Biognosys) and vortexed for 10 min prior to centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000xg.  Six microliters of samples were added to an LC tube with two microliters of the PlasmaDive standard mix (SIS) then they were mixed by pipetting.Peptide and SIS mixes were analyzed by MRM-HR and SWATH acquisition methods using the same gradient on an Eksigent NanoLC-Ultra-2D Plus HPLC system coupled to an AB Sciex 5600+ quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QqTOF).  The gradient was 95% buffer A at 0 min to 68% buffer A in 108 min, 20%  buffer A 115 min, 20% buffer A 125 min, 95% buffer A 131 min, and 95% buffer A 150 min using a 300 nL/min flow rate.  The MRM-HR method was established by performing an unscheduled MRM-HR method with iRT peptides (Biognosys) spiked into the samples as recommended by the manufacturer.  This run was analyzed using the SpectroDive software (Biognosys) and used to update retention time for all the target proteins included in the PlasmaDive panel.  The updated PlasmaDive panel information was exported from SpectroDive and imported into the Analyst software (AB Sciex) to create the scheduled MRM-HR method along with the settings described by Schilling et al.

### Data Protocol
The SpectroDive software was used to identify and quantify MRM-HR data using default settings.  All peaks identified with the software were evaluated manually.  A SWATH method was developed to optimize the number of points per peak; we determined that 40 windows provided ~8 data points per peak with our chromatography setup.  Additionally, we used data from a data-dependent acquisition run of a pooled plasma sample and the AB Sciex Variable Window Calculator tool to establish the final optimized SWATH method with 40 variable windows.  SWATH files were analyzed as raw WIFF files or HTRMS/HTRMS-centroid files as indicated.  HTRMS files were converted to this format using the HTRMS Conversion tool (Biognosys) with standard or centroid settings.  SWATH data was searched and quantified (protein quantification was set to the average area of the top three peptides) using default settings except the spike-in workflow was selected with Spectronaut software (29).   The FDR for peptides and proteins was set to 1%.  For data extraction, a Human Fractionated Plasma spectral library, included with the Spectronaut software package, was merged with the PlasmaDive panel spectral library, provided by Biognosys, to create the complete spectral library used for the analysis.  All identified peaks were manually evaluated to verify correct identifications and peak integrations.

### Publication Abstract
The current state of proteomics requires a choice between targeted and global discovery methods. A method, that combines targeted and data-independent acquisition for absolute quantification of all identified plasma proteins, in a single sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ions (SWATH) acquisition run, using a panel of spike-in standards (SIS), is established and optimized. The absolute quantification (AQ) of SWATH and multiple-reaction monitoring-high resolution (MRM-HR) acquisition methods are compared using the 100 protein PlasmaDive SIS panel spiked into non-depleted human plasma. SWATH provides equivalent quantification and differentially abundant protein profiles as MRM-HR. Absolute quantities of the SIS peptides from the SWATH data are used to estimate the absolute quantities (eAQ) for all the proteins in the run. The eAQ values provide similar quantification and differentially abundant protein profiles as AQ and protein area (PA) values. As a proof-of-concept, the eAQ method is applied to 12 plasma samples from six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and the performance of eAQ values versus peak area quantification is evaluated. There is a strong correlation between AQ and peak area ratios producing significant overlap of differentially abundant proteins. This eAQ method can provide quantitative data equivalent to AQ or peak area values.
