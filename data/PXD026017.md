### Title
Identification of MukBHN conformational changes upon AcpP binding using cross-linking mass spectrometry

### Description
Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes contribute ubiquitously to chromosome organization-segregation. SMC proteins have a conserved architecture, with a dimerization hinge and an ATPase head domain separated by a long antiparallel intramolecular coiled-coil. Dimeric SMC proteins interact with essential accessory proteins, kleisins that bridge the two subunits of an SMC dimer, and HAWK/KITE accessory proteins that interact with kleisins. The ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli SMC protein, MukB, is essential for in vivo function and is regulated by interactions with its dimeric kleisin, MukF, and KITE, MukE. Here we demonstrate that, in addition, MukB interacts with Acyl Carrier Protein (AcpP) that has essential functions in fatty acid synthesis. We characterize the AcpP interaction site at the joint of the MukB coiled-coil and show that the interaction is essential for MukB ATPase and for MukBEF function in vivo. Therefore, AcpP is an essential co-factor for MukBEF action in chromosome organization-segregation.

### Sample Protocol
BS3 (50-250X molar excess over MukBHN) was added to a sample of MukBHN, co-purified with or without AcpP, or with the addition of recombinant AcpP (at various molar ratios). Reactions were incubated at RT for 30 mins and quenched with Tris buffer (50 mM) before diluting with SDS-loading buffer and analyzing using SDS-PAGE. Gel bands corresponding to cross-linked species were excised, reduced with TCEP (10 mM) and alkylated with 2-Chloroacetamide (50 mM) before overnight digestion with Trypsin. Peptides samples were speed-vac dried and resuspended in 5% formic acid/ 5% DMSO before LC-MS/MS analysis. For LC-MS/MS analysis, peptides were separated by nano liquid chromatography  (Thermo Scientific Easy-nLC 1000)  coupled in line a Q Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an Easy-Spray source (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Peptides were trapped onto a C18 PepMac100 precolumn (300µm i.d.x5mm, 100Å, ThermoFischer Scientific) using Solvent A (0.1% Formic acid, HPLC grade water). The peptides were further separated onto an Easy-Spray RSLC C18 column (75um i.d., 50cm length, Thermo Fischer Scientific) using a 30 minutes linear gradient (15% to 35% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile)) at a flow rate 200nl/min. The raw data were acquired on the mass spectrometer in a data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA). Full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (Scan range 350-1500m/z, resolution 70,000; AGC target, 3e6, maximum injection time, 50ms). The 10 most intense peaks were selected for higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation at 30% of normalized collision energy. HCD spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at resolution 17,500, AGC target 5e4, maximum injection time 120ms with fixed mass at 180m/z. Charge exclusion was selected for unassigned and 1+ ions. The dynamic exclusion was set to 10 s.

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched using pLink software version 2.3.9 against a protein sequence database containing 963 protein entries, including 678 Escherichia coli proteins (uniprot database release of 2020-09), 283 common contaminants and His-tagged MukBHN (DEF-USER-1) and His-tagged AcpP (DEF-USER-2) protein sequences. During pLink2 searches, BS3 crosslinker was selected, cysteines (C) were considered to be fully carbamidomethylated (+57,0215, statically added), methionine (M) to be fully oxidised (+15,9949, dynamically added), all N-terminal residues to be acetylated (+42,0106, dynamically added). Three missed cleavages were permitted. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 20ppm on the precursor and fragment ions. Data was filtered at FDR below 5% at PSM level.

### Publication Abstract
Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes act ubiquitously to compact DNA linearly, thereby facilitating chromosome organization-segregation. SMC proteins have a conserved architecture, with a dimerization hinge and an ATPase head domain separated by a long antiparallel intramolecular coiled-coil. Dimeric SMC proteins interact with essential accessory proteins, kleisins that bridge the two subunits of an SMC dimer, and HAWK/KITE proteins that interact with kleisins. The ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli SMC protein, MukB, which is essential for its in vivo function, requires its interaction with the dimeric kleisin, MukF that in turn interacts with the KITE protein, MukE. Here we demonstrate that, in addition, MukB interacts specifically with Acyl Carrier Protein (AcpP) that has essential functions in fatty acid synthesis. We characterize the AcpP interaction at the joint of the MukB coiled-coil and show that the interaction is necessary for MukB ATPase and for MukBEF function in vivo.
