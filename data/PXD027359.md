### Title
AlphaTims: Indexing unprocessed trapped ion mobility spectrometry - time of flight data for fast and easy accession and visualization

### Description
High resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics generates large amounts of data, even in the standard liquid chromatography (LC) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tandem mass spectrometry configuration. Adding an ion mobility dimension vastly increases the acquired data volume, challenging both analytical processing pipelines and especially data exploration by scientists. This has necessitated data aggregation, effectively discarding much of the information present in these rich data sets. Taking trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) on the quadrupole time of flight platform (Q-TOF) as an example, we developed an efficient indexing scheme that represents all data points as detector arrival times on scales of seconds (LC), milliseconds (TIMS) and microseconds (TOF). In our open source AlphaTims package, data are indexed, accessed and visualized by a combination of tools of the scientific Python ecosystem. We interpret unprocessed data as a sparse 4D matrix and use just in time compilation to machine code with Numba, accelerating our computational procedures by several orders of magnitude while keeping to familiar indexing and slicing notations. For samples with more than six billion detector events a modern laptop can load and index raw data in about a minute. Loading is even faster when AlphaTims has already saved indexed data in a HDF5 file, a portable scientific standard used in extremely large-scale data acquisition. Subsequently, data accession along any dimension and interactive visualization happen in milliseconds. We have found AlphaTims to be a key enabling tool to explore high dimensional LC-TIMS-Q-TOF data and have made it freely available as an open-source Python package with a stand-alone graphical user interface at https://github.com/MannLabs/alphatims or as part of the AlphaPept framework.

### Sample Protocol
Single-run LC-MS analysis was executed via liquid chromatography systems coupled online with a timsTOF Pro (Bruker)19. The samples were separated with a predefined 200 samples per day (SPD) method (6 minute gradient time, 50ng peptides) and a predefined 60 SPD method (21 minute gradient time, 200ng peptides), performed with an Evosep One liquid chromatography system (Evosep)20. A 10 Ã‚Âµm silica emitter (Bruker) was placed inside a nano-electrospray ion source (Captive spray source, Bruker). For the 200 SPD method (Evosep), the emitter was connected to a 4 cm x 150 Ã‚Âµm reverse phase column, packed with 3 Ã‚Âµm C18-beads, and for the 60 SPD method (Evosep) to an 8 cm x 150 Ã‚Âµm reverse phase column, packed with 1.5 Ã‚Âµm C18-beads (PepSep, Denmark). Mobile phases were water and acetonitrile, buffered with 0.1% formic acid. Additionally, 400ng peptides were separated over 120 minutes on a 50 cm in-house reverse-phase column with an inner diameter of 75 Ã‚Âµm, packed with 1.9 Ã‚Âµm C18-beads (Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur AQ, Germany) and a laser-pulled electrospray emitter. The column was heated to 60 Ã‚Â°C in an oven compartment. The binary LC system consisted of water as buffer A and acetonitrile/water (80%/20%, v/v) as buffer B, both buffers containing 0.1% formic acid (EasyLC, Thermo Fischer Scientific). The gradients started with a buffer B concentration of 3%. In 95 minutes, the buffer B concentration was increased to 30%, in 5 minutes to 60%, and 5 minutes to 95%. A buffer B concentration of 95% was held for 5 min before decreasing to 5% in 5 minutes and re-equilibrating for further 5 minutes. All steps of the gradients were performed at a flow rate of 300 nL min-1.  After separation, the mass spectrometric data were acquired on a tims quadrupole time of flight instrument (timsTOF Pro, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) with ddaPASEF and diaPASEF7,8. For both acquisition modes, the ion mobility dimension was calibrated with three Agilent ESI-L Tuning Mix ions (m/z, 1/k_0: 622.0289, 0.9848 VS cm-2, 922.0097, 1.1895 VS cm-2, 1221.9906, 1.3820 Vs cm-2). Furthermore, the collision energy was decreased linearly from 59 eV at 1/k_0 = 1.6 Vs cm-2 to 20 eV at 1/k_0 = 0.6 Vs cm-2. For the ddaPASEF method, each topN acquisition cycle consisted of 4 PASEF MS/MS scans for the 200 SPD and 60 SPD method and 10 PASEF MS/MS scans for the 120-minute gradient. The accumulation and ramp times were set to 100 milliseconds. Single-charged precursors were excluded using a polygon filter in the (m/z, ion mobility) plane. Furthermore, all precursors that reached the target value of 20000 were excluded for 0.4 min from the fragmentation. Precursors were isolated with a quadrupole window of 2 Th for m/z<700 and 3 Th for m/z>700. For diaPASEF we used the â€œhigh-speedâ€� method (mass range: m/z 400 to 1000, 1/k_0: 0.6 â€“ 1.6 Vs cm- 2, diaPASEF windows: 8 x 25 Th), as described in Meier et al.8.  A final sample was acquired with identical settings as the 60 SPD ddaPASEF method. To intentionally introduce anomalies, the TOF was calibrated with an offset of 1 Da and the air supply of the nano-electrospray ion source filter was stopped between minute 12 and 13.

### Data Protocol
AlphaTims is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/MannLabs/alphatims) under an Apache license. The source code is divided into two core Python modules: bruker.py provides the TimsTOF class and all functions to create, index and access objects from this class, whereas the utils.py module provides generic utilities for logging, compilation, parallelization and I/O. Three additional modules implement all functionality for plotting, the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line interface (CLI).
