### Title
Highly Active CAR T Cells that Bind to a Juxta-Membrane Region of Mesothelin and are Not Blocked by Shed Mesothelin

### Description
Identification of the major protease sites in MSLN and preparation of a monoclonal antibody, 15B6, that binds next to cell membrane at the protease sensitive region and inhibits MSLN shedding. Mab 15B6 makes very active CAR-T cells whose activity is not blocked by shed MSLN. The 15B6 CAR-T cells have greatly superior anti-tumor activity in mice than CAR-T cells targeting an epitope in shed MSLN.

### Sample Protocol
To isolate shed MSLN from cells and ascites, an anti-MSLN column was prepared by covalently immobilizing two mg of SS1P, an anti-MSLN recombinant immunotoxin (1) on a column packed with NHS-activated Sepharose resin. After washing the column with 10 column volumes of PBS, non-specific binding proteins were removed by washing with sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and MSLN eluted with acetate buffer pH 3.0.

### Data Protocol
The affinity purified samples were reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin, and analyzed via nano-LC-MS/MS. To quantify the C-terminal composition, the area under the curve of each peak was calculated to measure the relative percent composition of each C-terminal peptide.
