### Title
Extracellular Matrix Proteomics of Human Heart Failure.

### Description
MS analysis of human cardiac samples from left ventricles of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation due to ischaemic heart failure. Analysis of extracellular matrix enriched extracts.

### Sample Protocol
Protein was extracted from cardiac samples using a 3-step methodology described in Barallobre-Barreiro et al (Circulation, 2012). GuHCl extracts, enriched in extracellular matrix proteins were analysed in this experiment. Trypsin was used to digest protein into peptides. Peptides were analyzed using nano-flow reversed-phase LC-MS (UltiMate 3000 coupled to Q Exactive HF via EASY-Spray Source, all Thermo Scientific). LC gradient: 0–5min, 4–10% B; 5–75min, 10–30% B; 75−80min, 30−40% B; 80–85min, 40–99% B; 85–89.8min, 99% B; 89.8–90min, 99–4% B; 90–120min, 4% B; A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water. Q Exactive HF was operating in data-dependent TopN mode (loop count 15). Survey full scan spectra were acquired over m/z range 350–1,600 using Orbitrap detection (resolution 60,000). HCD-type data-dependent MS2 spectra were obtained using Orbitrap detection (resolution 15,000).

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Scientific) was used to search raw data files against a human database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version January 2017, 20,171 protein entries) using Mascot (version 2.6.0, Matrix Science). Precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 20 mmu. Digestion enzyme was trypsin, maximum number of missed cleavages was 2. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (static), oxidation of lysine/methionine/proline (dynamic) and deamidation of asparagine in presence of 18O water (dynamic) were chosen as modifications. Peptide abundances were determined based on precursor ion intensity.
