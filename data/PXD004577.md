### Title
Proteomics of Tsetse salivary glands before and after infection with Trypanosoma parasite.

### Description
Trypanosoma brucei causes African trypanosomosis to humans and cattle, against which there are no effective vaccines or drugs. The tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans is the primary vector of the species of T. brucei group.  At the moment there is limited knowledge on how trypanosomes adapt to and evade the host defence responses in the salivary glands. The research described aims to identify proteins involved in the mechanisms that facilitate infection.

### Sample Protocol
Ten intact pairs of salivary glands of male control and infected Tsetse flies of x days old, were homogenized and ultra-sonicated in 150 ul sterile saline. After centrifugation, protein concnetrations were determined in the supernantants. 600 ng protein was loaded and resolved in 12 % SDS-PAGE gels and stained with CoomasieBrilliantBlue. Gel lanes were divided into five equal fractions for in-gel digestion. Peptide samples obtained were meaured by nLC-MSMS using a Proxeon EASY nLC connected to a LTQ-Orbitrap XL.

### Data Protocol
Maxquant was used for peptide identification and protein relative quantitation.
