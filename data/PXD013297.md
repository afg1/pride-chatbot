### Title
Combinatorial proteomics and transcriptomics identify AMPK in the control of the axonal regeneration programme of DRG sensory neurons after spinal injury

### Description
Axoplasmic proteomics from sciatic or centrally projecting branches of sciatic DRG identifies unique protein enrichment and signalling pathways, including prior and subsequent to a spinal regeneration-incompetent versus sciatic regeneration-competent axonal injury.

### Sample Protocol
6-8-week old mice underwent bilateral sciatic nerve axotomy (SNA), dorsal column axtomy (DCA) or relative sham injury. 24h later, animals were sacrificed and the proximal nerve segments were collected as described previously (Rishal et al., 2010). 15 mice were used for each group and biological triplicates were performed with each condition.  Equal amounts of total protein lysate were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, separated into 6 fractions and in-gel digestion was performed (dithiothreitol, iodoacteamide, trypsin). Reductive methylation was used to chemically label peptides and fractions mixed 1:1 as follows: 
EXT_CF_0008 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Axotomy+EE_1), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_1), Light label;
EXT_CF_0009 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Axotomy+EE_2), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_2), Light label;
EXT_CF_0010 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Axotomy+EE_3), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_3), Light label;
EXT_CF_0014 = A,B,C,D,E,F (SNA _1), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_1), Light label;
EXT_CF_0015 = A,B,C,D,E,F (SNA _2), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_2), Light label;
EXT_CF_0016 = A,B,C,D,E,F (SNA _3), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Sham_3), Light label;
EXT_CF_0061 = A,B,C,D,E,F (DCA1), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (LAM1), Light label;
EXT_CF_0062 = A,B,C,D,E,F (DCA2), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (LAM2), Light label;
EXT_CF_0063 = A,B,C,D,E,F (DCA3), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (LAM3), Light label;
EXT_CF_0087 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Central1), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Peripheral), Light label;
EXT_CF_0089 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Central2), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Peripheral), Light label;
EXT_CF_0090 = A,B,C,D,E,F (Central3), Heavy label + A,B,C,D,E,F (Peripheral), Light label;
Light label = DimethylLys0 and DimethylNter0 and Heavy label = DimethylLys4 and DimethylNter4

### Data Protocol
Spectra were recorded with a Q Exactive Plus operating in positive mode and recording TOP10 MSMS. Spectra were searched against Mus Musculus Ensembl database (release-81; downloaded 3rd July 2015 with 53819 entries) in MaxQuant Version 1.5.2.8
