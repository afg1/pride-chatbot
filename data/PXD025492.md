### Title
A massively parallel reporter assay reveals novel features and players of RNA localization in neurons

### Description
This experiment aims to identify the RNA-binding proteome that is pulled-down from a cellular lysate with biotinylated RNA probes.

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, 3’-desthiobiotin labelled RNAs were incubated with magnetic streptatividin-coated beads (50uL of slurry)/each RNA probe) for 30’ at room temperature, under agitation (600 RPM in a ThermoMixer, Eppendorf). 200ug of cell lysates (in Pierce IP lysis buffer; #87787, ThermoFisher), derived from fully differentiated CAD or N2a cells, were then incubated with 3’-desthiobiotinilated-RNA/streptavidin beads at 4°C for 1h under agitation (600 RPM). Final elution was performed in 50uL/pull-down. 20uL of each eluate was then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. TCA precipitation protein digestion Trichloroacetic (TCA) precipitation:  20 μl of each sample + 80 μl of H2O + 100 μl of 10% TCA (5% TCA end concentration)  Protein pellets were washed twice with cold acetone, dried and dissolved as follows:  + 45 μl of 10 mM Tris/2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.2 buffer;  + 5 μl trypsin (100 ng/μl in 10 mM HCl);  + 0.3 μl trypsin Tris 1M, pH 8.2 to adjusted to pH 8. Microwave assisted digestion (60° C, 30 min), samples were dried.

### Data Protocol
The protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant v1.6.2.3 and the data were searched against the Swissprot mouse database.
