### Title
Protective effects of breviscapine on HFHC diet-induced C57 mice

### Description
The proteomics data of liver tissue of 16-week-old HFHC-induced mice treated with saline or breviscapine for 8 weeks. The mice fed with high fat and high cholesterol were also divided into two groups. The control group was treated with normal saline for 8W, and the drug group was treated with breviscapine for 8W n=3.

### Sample Protocol
The mice fed with high fat and high cholesterol were also divided into two groups. The control group was treated with normal saline for 8W, and the drug group was treated with breviscapine for 8W n=3.

### Data Protocol
Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The abundance of peptide fractions in the control group and the treatment group was quantified using unlabeled quantitative methods, and the difference in the abundance of phosphorylated peptide fractions between the control group and the treatment group was tested for significance by t-test. The screening criterion for differentially expressed proteins was a P value less than 0.05.
