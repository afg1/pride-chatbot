### Title
Effects of HIT and B2 agonist Terbutaline on muscle

### Description
Effects of high intensity training and the B2 agonist Terbutaline on muscle

### Sample Protocol
Muscle samples were homogenized into a non-denaturing buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0) followed by denaturing buffer (7M urea, 2M thiourea, 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0)  Tryptic digests prepared using the co-precipitation method and peptides analysed using Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC and LTQ-Orbitrap MS

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant platform for LFQ used based on FDR of 0.01 for peptide and protein ID, Andromeda search engine used to interrogate the Human complete proteome database.
