### Title
Discovery of plasma/serum protein biomarkers for progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to disease

### Description
The overall scope of this study is to find early tuberculosis (TB) candidate protein biomarkers in different TB study groups vs. controls. The identified biomarkers may become the basis of a rapid diagnostic test able to identify active TB earlier than current practice. In addition, the candidate biomarkers may predict which patients are likely to convert from latent infection to active disease. . This project uses plasma and serum samples collected in a long-standing TB household contact study, the Kawempe Community Health Study, conducted in Kampala, Uganda, a TB endemic area. The study utilizes samples from TB index cases and household contacts that were negative for TB at recruitment. A subset of these contacts developed Mtb infection (i.e., their Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) converted to positive) after 3-6 months, and smaller subset developed active TB after 3 months of follow-up. Control patients were still TST negative at 12 months or 24 months of follow-up. This dataset corresponds to the discovery phase of the study.

### Sample Protocol
Sera and plasma were aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C until testing. Samples were grouped into blocks containing each of the clinical groups (active TB, LTBI, converters, and NI) and the order of the samples within each block was randomized. Samples were depleted of abundant proteins using an HSA/IgG column (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON) in tandem with an IgY14 and Supermix (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario) column and the flow through was digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10. The digested samples were freeze-dried, resolubilized, and treated with TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine] to reduce disulfide bonds. Samples were desalted by solid phase extraction using a 3M Empore C18 desalting plate and distributed into 96-well plates and vacuum evaporated. Peptides were stored at − 20 °C until use. Sample processing variability was measured using aliquots of pooled plasma that were inserted at regular intervals among the study samples and taken through the entire analysis. For the Discovery study the process quality control sample CV was 20.45%, and for Verification study 1 and 2 the CVs were 10.99% and 4.3%, respectively. Samples were resuspended in 92.5/7.5 water/ACN + 0.2% formic acid and analyzed by LC-MS (nanoAcquity UPLC and Q Exactive mass spectrometer). Peptide separation was achieved using a Waters nanoAcquity Symmetry UPLC Trap column (180 μm × 20 mm, 5 μm particle size) and a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC BEH130 analytical column (150 μm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm particle size). The mobile phases were (A) 0.2% formic acid in water and (B) 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. For each sample approximately 2.5 μg was loaded onto the analytical column. Peptides were separated using a 52.5 min gradient (92.5% A to 40% A) at a flow rate of 1.8 μL/min. MS spectra were acquired from 400 to 1800 Da. The MS method consisted of a Full MS scan followed by a dd-MS2 scan of the top 12 ions. The Full MS scan was achieved at a resolution of 70,000 with an AGC value of 3e6 and a maximum IT of 30 ms. The dd-MS2 scan was performed at a resolution of 17,500 with an AGC target value of 5e4 and a maximum IT of 60 ms.

### Data Protocol
Components, defined as ions that have been identified by their mass/charge ratios, retention times, and intensities but do not yet have sequence information, were detected and matched across all samples using the Elucidator software version 3.3 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA). Presence of unusual modifications was determined using Preview Software (Protein Metrics). Fragmentation patterns were matched to the corresponding sequences found in a combined database containing Human (reviewed entries only) downloaded on 20,121,206 from Uniprot, using Mascot software version 2.2.06 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). The following parameters were used for the searches: enzyme = trypsin, allowed missed cleavages = 2, peptide tolerance = 20 ppm, MS/MS tolerance = 0.4 Da, variable modifications = Deamidation (N, Q), Oxidation (M), Acetaldehyde (N-term). A decoy reverse database was used to evaluate false positive error rate. Peptide/Protein Teller helped derive the simplest list of proteins to explain observed peptides, at a FDR of 5%. All intensities were log (base e) transformed. 42,654 peptides, whose intensities reached LOD (= 50,000) in at least 15 samples, were included in subsequent analyses. The overall intensity bias was corrected so that, between each pair of samples, the median of the difference of the peptide intensities (in log scale) of the two samples over all the peptides was 0, or close to. For batch-effect correction, a one-way ANOVA model Iij = M + Di + εij (I: intensity, M: overall interception, and D: batch–factor) was solved and parameters Di (i = 1…5) under the constraint of Σi = 110 (Ni ∗ Di) = 0 were obtained; the Di's were then subtracted from the normalized intensities to form the ‘batch-effect corrected’ intensities. Intensities below an intensity threshold (IT), IT = 50,000, were transformed to avoid spurious large fold changes as follows: I ➔ (I + IT) / 2 (i.e. intensity in the range of (0, IT) was linearly mapped to the range of (IT/2, IT)). ANOVA analysis was then applied to identify differentially expressed peptides. ANOVA model: Iij = M + Ti + εij where I is peptide intensity, M is overall average intensity, t is ‘condition’ factor, and ε random error (Keeping, 1995, Montgomery, 2001). False detection rate and q-value were calculated based on the p-values obtained from the ANOVA using Storey's method to make multiple testing adjustments (implemented in MATLAB) (Storey, 2002). ‘Post hoc’ contrast analyses were conducted using Tukey's hsd method to calculate p-values for each pair wise comparison (Hochberg and Tamhane, 2008). A protein level analysis was then applied by introducing a ‘peptide factor’ in the ANOVA used above: Iijk = M + Ti + Pj + εijk where I is protein intensity, M overall constant, T ‘condition’, and P peptide factor. The number of the levels for P is protein-dependent, equal to the number of peptides for the protein. Proteins were considered to be differentially expressed if they met the following thresholds: p- and q-values < 0.05 and differential intensity (DI) > 1.1-fold change (or < 0.9 for decrease).

### Publication Abstract
The objective of this study was to identify blood-based protein biomarkers of early stage Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. We utilized plasma and serum specimens from TB patients and their contacts (age&#x2265;12) enrolled in a household contact study in Uganda. In the discovery phase cross-sectional samples from 104 HIV-uninfected persons classified as either active TB, latent Mtb infection (LTBI), tuberculin skin test (TST) converters, or persistent TST-negative were analyzed. Two hundred eighty-nine statistically significant (false discovery rate corrected p&lt;0.05) differentially expressed proteins were identified across all comparisons. Proteins associated with cellular immunity and lipid metabolism were induced early after Mtb infection. One hundred and fifty-nine proteins were selected for a targeted mass spectrometry assay. A set of longitudinal samples from 52 TST-negative subjects who converted to TST-positive or remained TST-negative were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify unique protein panels able to predict TST conversion with cross-validated AUC&gt;0.85. Panel performance was confirmed with an independent validation set of longitudinal samples from 16 subjects. These candidate protein biomarkers may allow for the identification of recently Mtb infected individuals at highest risk for developing active TB and most likely to benefit from preventive therapy.
