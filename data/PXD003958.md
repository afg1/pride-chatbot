### Title
In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics - PXD001118 Swiss-Prot analysis

### Description
This dataset is no actual new study but the results of the benchmark against the submission PXD001118 used in the manuscript "In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics".

### Sample Protocol
For the complete sample processing, please see the dataset PXD001118.

### Data Protocol
The HCD measurement of the PXD001118 was used for reanalysis. For the peptide identification a precursor tolerance of 10 ppm, a fragment tolerance of 0.02 Da, two missed cleavages were used. as fixed modifications Propionyl of the peptide N-Term and all K was set. As the K masked cleavage of trypsin, only [R]|{P} was used for computational digestion, to not increase the missed cleavages too much.
