### Title
Unbiased proteomic analysis of postsynaptic density fractions from Shank3 mutant mice reveals brain region specific changes highly relevant to autism spectrum disorder

### Description
Disruption of the human SHANK3 gene can cause several neuropsychiatric disease entities including Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability (ID). Although a wide array of neurobiological studies strongly supports a major role for SHANK3 in organizing the postsynaptic protein scaffold, the molecular processes at synapses of individuals harboring SHANK3 mutations are still far from being understood. In this study, we biochemically isolated the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction from striatum and hippocampus of Shank3Δ11-/- mutant mice and performed ion-mobility enhanced data-independent label-free LC-MS/MS to obtain the corresponding PSD proteomes. This unbiased approach to identify molecular disturbances at PSDs devoid of major Shank3 isoforms revealed largely distinct molecular alterations in striatum and hippocampus. Being the first comprehensive analysis of brain region specific PSD proteomes from a Shank3 mutant line, our study provides crucial information on molecular alterations that could foster translational treatment studies for SHANK3 mutation-associated synaptopathies and possibly also ASD in general.

### Sample Protocol
Isolation of PSD from hippocampus and striatum of Shank3Δ11-/- mutant as well as wild type mice using ultracentrifugation and Triton X-100 extraction, tryptic digestion of isolated PSD proteins by filter-aided sample preparation, separation of peptides on a nanoAcquity nanoUPLC system, mass spectrometric analysis on a Synapt G2-S HDMS instrument.

### Data Protocol
Peptide and protein identification with ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS), and run alignment and label-free quantification with ISOQuant.

### Publication Abstract
Disruption of the human <i>SHANK3</i> gene can cause several neuropsychiatric disease entities including Phelan-McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. Although, a wide array of neurobiological studies strongly supports a major role for SHANK3 in organizing the post-synaptic protein scaffold, the molecular processes at synapses of individuals harboring <i>SHANK3</i> mutations are still far from being understood. In this study, we biochemically isolated the post-synaptic density (PSD) fraction from striatum and hippocampus of adult <i>Shank3&#x394;11<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutant mice and performed ion-mobility enhanced data-independent label-free LC-MS/MS to obtain the corresponding PSD proteomes (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005192). This unbiased approach to identify molecular disturbances at <i>Shank3</i> mutant PSDs revealed hitherto unknown brain region specific alterations including a striatal decrease of several molecules encoded by ASD susceptibility genes such as the serine/threonine kinase Cdkl5 and the potassium channel K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1. Being the first comprehensive analysis of brain region specific PSD proteomes from a <i>Shank3</i> mutant line, our study provides crucial information on molecular alterations that could foster translational treatment studies for <i>SHANK3</i> mutation-associated synaptopathies and possibly also ASD in general.
