### Title
Meltome Analysis of Geobacillus thermoleoverans ARTRW1

### Description
Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) analysis has been applied to a thermophilic bacterial proteome, recently isolated strain of Geobacillus thermoloverans, ARTW1 and thermal stability of more than 1000 proteins were presented. The thermal proteome was investigated in terms of thermostable enzymes that are relevant to industrial applications.

### Sample Protocol
The organism was grown at its optimal growth temperature. After lysis, the lysate was aliquoted into ten 0.2 ml PCR tubes and the tubes were subjected to a temperature gradient with one of ten temperatures between 55°C and 91°C for 3 min in a PCR Machine, followed by 3 min at room temperature. The tubes were vortexed briefly and the lysates were transferred into the 0.2 ml polycarbonate thickwall tubes (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, USA) and the lysates were ultra-centrifuged at 100,000g for 20 min at 4 ℃.  Using the iFASP methodology lysates corresponding to each of the 10 different temperatures were digested eith trypsin and labeled with TMT-10 reagent, analyzed with Orbitrap Q Exactive HFX

### Data Protocol
Raw files were searched with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 and melting curves determined from protein intensities using the Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) R package.
