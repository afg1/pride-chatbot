### Title
NleH LFQ phoshoproteome analysis

### Description
Using Phosphopeptide enrichment and MS analysis the effect of NleH1 and NleH2 on the phosphoproteome of host cells was investigated

### Sample Protocol
Three biological replicates of each condition (uninfected, WT infected , detla NleH1 NleH2 infected, pNleH1 infected and pNleH2 infection) were lyzed, acetone precipated and digested with trypsin overnight. Peptide were cleaned up with tC18 sep-pak columans and then enriched using TiO2 based enrichment. Enriched samples were analyzed ona Fusion lumos using 4 hr analyical graidents with HCD fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Data analyzsis was undertaken using Maxquant version 1.5.3.30 with the LFQ option enabled. Downstream processing was undertaken using Perseus 1.5.0.9
