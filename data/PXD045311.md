### Title
A comprehensive portrait of tissue-, age- and sex-specific DNA modifications in rodents and humans

### Description
DNA damage causes genomic instability underlying many diseases, with traditional analytical approaches providing minimal insight into the spectrum of DNA lesions in vivo. Here we used untargeted chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry-based adductomics (LC-MS/MS) to define the landscape of DNA modifications in rat and human tissues. A basis set of 114 putative DNA adducts was identified in heart, liver, brain, and kidney in 1-26-month-old rats and 111 in human heart and brain by “stepped MRM” LC-MS/MS. Subsequent targeted analysis of these species revealed species-, tissue-, age-, and sex-biases. Structural characterization of 10 selected adductomic signals as known DNA modifications validated the method and established confidence in the DNA origins of the signals. Along with strong tissue biases, we observed significant age-dependence for 36 adducts, including N2-CMdG, 5-HMdC, and 8-Oxo-dG in rats and 1,N6-εdA in human heart, as well as sex biases for 67 adducts in rat tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of adductomics for discovering the true spectrum of disease-driving DNA adducts. Our dataset of 114 putative adducts serves as a resource for characterizing dozens of new forms of DNA damage, defining mechanisms of their formation and repair, and developing biomarkers of aging and disease.
