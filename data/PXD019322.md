### Title
Mitochondrial isolation from C. burnetii-infected macrophages

### Description
Mitochondria were isolated from human THP-1 derived macrophages and purified using a sucrose gradient and hTom22-magnetic affinity purification.

### Sample Protocol
Mitochondrial samples from 3 independent biological replicates of each 'crude' and 'pure' conditions were lysed and acetone precipitated overnight. Samples were resuspended in 6M urea and 2M thiourea, reduced with 10mM DTT for one hour and alkylated with 40mM CAA for one hour. Protein was pre-digested for 4 hours with Lys-C and overnight with Trypsin.Peptides were cleaned up using C18 stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using MaxQuant platform (version 1.6.2.10). Further analysis was underatken in Perseus (version 1.6.12.10).
