### Title
A conserved aminopeptidase PepN, exhibits divergent traits in pathogenic and non- pathogenic mycobacteria

### Description
A conserved aminopeptidase PepN, exhibits divergent traits in pathogenic and non- pathogenic mycobacteria

### Sample Protocol
All samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using an Ekspert-nanoLC 415 system (Eksigent; Dublin, CA) which is directly connected to an ABSCIEX 5600 Triple-TOF (AB SCIEX; Concord, Canada) mass spectrometer, referred as Triple TOF system.

### Data Protocol
All DDA mass spectrometry files were searched in Protein Pilot software v. 5.0.1 (AB SCIEX)with the Paragon algorithm. For Paragon searches, the following settings were used: Sample type: Identification; Cysteine Alkylation: methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), Digestion: Trypsin; Instrument: TripleTOF5600; Special Factors: BONCAT Workflow; Species: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Search effort: Thorough ID; Results Quality: 0.05. Only peptides with a confidence score of &gt; 0.05 were considered for further analysis. The search wasconducted using a through identification effort of a Swiss-Prot database from the UniProt website (www.uniprot.org). False discovery rate analysis was also performed. Carbamidomethylation (C) was used as a fixed modification.

### Publication Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) secretes proteases and peptidases to subjugate its host. Out of its sixty plus proteases, atleast three are reported to reach host macrophages. In this study, we show that Mtb also delivers a lysyl alanine aminopeptidase, PepN (Rv2467) into host macrophage cytosol. Our comparative in silico analysis shows PepNMtb highly conserved across all pathogenic mycobacteria. Non-pathogenic mycobacteria including M. smegmatis (Msm) also encode pepN. PepN protein levels in both Mtb (pathogenic) and Msm (non-pathogenic) remain uniform across all in vitro growth phases. Despite such tight maintenance of PepNs' steady state levels, upon supplementation, Mtb alone allows accumulation of any excessive PepN. In contrast, Msm does not. It not only proteolyzes, but also secretes out the excessive PepN, be it native or foreign. Interestingly, while PepNMtb is required for modulating virulence in vivo, PepNMsm is essential for Msm growth in vitro. Despite such essentiality difference, both PepNMtb and PepNMsm harbor almost identical N-terminal M1-type peptidase domains that significantly align in their amino acid sequences and overlap in their secondary structures. Their C-terminal ERAP1_C-like domains however align much more moderately. Our in vitro macrophage-based infection experiments with Mtb&#x394;pepN-expressing pepNMsm reveals PepNMsm also retaining the ability to reach host cytosol. Lastly, but notably, we determined the PepNMtb and PepNMsm interactomes and found them to barely coincide. While PepNMtb chiefly interacts with Mtb's secreted proteins, PepNMsm primarily coimmunoprecipitates with Msm's housekeeping proteins. Thus, despite high sequence homology and several common properties, our comparative analytical study reveals host-centric traits of pathogenic and bacterial-centric traits of non-pathogenic PepNs.
