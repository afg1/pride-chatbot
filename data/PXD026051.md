### Title
Deep proteomic analysis of small arteries unravels critical changes associated with early-onset high blood pressure in hypertensive rats

### Description
Background: The vascular wall of small arteries is heavily affected by high blood pressure. However, the underlying mechanisms causing vascular changes are not fully elucidated. Using a novel data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) approach, we aimed to determine the proteomic changes in small mesenteric arteries during early-onset high blood pressure in a rat model of hypertension.  Methods: Snap frozen small mesenteric and renal arteries from the spontaneous hypertension rat (SHR) model and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) control rats were collected from two time points (6- and 12-weels of age) and analyzed by a label free quantitative DIA-MS workflow. Mesenteric arteries from Wister Hannover rats were included as an additional control to clarify genetic drift caused by selective inbreeding.   Results: We identified a total of 3956 consistent proteins in the mesenteric artery wall and found that 286 proteins were significantly regulated in 12-weeks old SHRs compared to WKY controls. Comparing to an in silico matrisome database, we identified 38 extracellular matrix-associated proteins that could distinguish SHRs from WKY controls. Furthermore, when comparing the significantly regulated proteins identified in mesenteric and renal arteries, we identified 18 proteins, including  Serpina3l, Igg-2a, ENSRNOG00000049829, Acyp2, Enpp3, Lss, Acaa1a, Basp1, an isoform of Basp1, Flot1, Flot2, Gstt1, Nit1, Ppid, Ikbkap, Poglut3, P4ha2 and Usp15, that were changed in both vascular beds. These proteins were associated with vital cellular processes, such as dyslipidemia, protease inhibition, remodeling and generation of reactive oxygen species. Majority of the identified proteins and pathways were associated with hypertension, and mapping the underlying changes help understanding the pathological processes occurring in the arterial wall during early-onset hypertension. Conclusions: Our data provides an in-depth analysis of the proteomic architecture of the mesenteric and renal artery wall from SHRs and WKY control rats. We identified 18 novel candidate proteins that highlights critical changes in small arteries of the SHR.

### Sample Protocol
Protein isolation and quantification:  Snap frozen arteries were homogenized in 200 Ã‚Âµl of ice cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1% NP-40 and 1 x complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) by three rounds of chopping the tissue using dissection scissors and a handheld homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 11000 g for 10 mins at 4°C to obtain the supernatant. Protein quantification of the tissue extracts was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo Scientific, Denmark).  Sample preparation for proteomic analysis:  Tissue extracts (100 Ã‚Âµg) were diluted in digestion buffer (0.5 % SDC in 50 mM TEAB), heat-treated for 5 mins at 95 Ã‚Â°C and prepared by a modified filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol. In brief, tissue extracts were transferred to 0.5 ml (tilted) spin filters (Amicon), centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 mins and reduced and alkylated by addition of digestion buffer containing 1:50 (v:v) tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (0.5M, Sigma, Denmark) and 1:10 (v:v) 2-chloroacetamide (Sigma, Denmark) for 30 mins at 37 Ã‚Â°C. Samples were digested in fresh digestion buffer containing 1 Ã‚Âµg Typsin/LysC mix (Promega) and 0.01 % ProteaseMAXTM (Promega) O/N at 37°C. Digested samples were desalted using stage-tips containing styrene divinylbenzene reversed phase sulfonate material (SDB-RPS; 3 M).  The mesenteric artery-based library was generated using a pooled digested and stage-tipped sample from the 12-weeks old SHRs and WKYs that was fractionated. A high pH reverse phase peptide (HpH) fractionation kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Denmark) was used to create the 15 fractionations.    Data acquisition by LC-MS/MS: Peptides were separated on 50 cm columns packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 um resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Liquid chromatography was performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 ultra-high-pressure system coupled through a nanoelectrospray source to an Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1 % formic acid) and separated applying a non-linear gradient of 5 - 65 % buffer B (0.1 % formic acid, 80 % acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min over 100 min. Spray voltage was set to 2400 V. Data acquisition switched between a full scan (120K resolution, 45 ms max. injection time, AGC target 300 %) and 49 DIA scans with isolation width of 13.7 m/z and windows overlap of 1 m/z spanning a precursor mass range of 361 - 1033 m/z (15K resolution, 22 ms max. injection time, AGC target 1000 %). Normalized collision energy was set to 27.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification by computational data analysis: Raw DDA and DIA files were first searched in Spectronaut (14.7.201007.47784) using the Pulsar search engine to generate the hybrid library. The hybrid library was then used for library-based DIA analysis using default settings. Data was searched against UniProt FASTA database (UP000002494_10116.fasta and UP000002494_10116_additional.fasta, August 2020).  All downstream data analysis was performed in Perseus (v1.6.14.0) and R (v4.0.3). Protein groups from the datasets were filtered by Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 unique peptides and minimum 75% valid values in each group. Data was log2 transformed and missing values were imputed (width = 0.2, down shift = 1.8). Volcano plots and two sided Student t-test were generated using 250 randomizations, permutated FDR < 0.05, and p < 0.05. ECM-enrichment was achieved by comparing to a curated matrisome gene list and selecting overlapping proteins for further analysis. Hierarchical clustering was based on z-scored LFQ values and generated by average linkage, preprocessing with k-means and Euclidean distance. ClueGO network analysis was performed in Cytoscape (v3.8.1) using the ClueGo app20 (v2.5.7). In brief, rattus norvegicus was selected as organism, significantly regulated proteins were added and the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes (GO-BiologicalProcess, CellularComponent, ImmuneSystemProcess, MolecularFunction-EBI-UniProt-GOA-ACAP-ARAP, downloaded 15.01.2010) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, downloaded 15.01.2010) with the kappa-score = 0.4 was used. Two-sided hypergeometric test was used with false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni step down, P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05) and GO term fusion was enabled. A minimum of 3 genes and 4% genes per term was applied.

### Publication Abstract
Resistance arteries are small blood vessels that create resistance to blood flow. In hypertension, resistance arteries undergo remodeling, affecting their ability to contract and relax appropriately. To date, no study has mapped the hypertension-related proteomic changes in resistance arteries. Using a novel data-independent acquisition-mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) approach, we determined the proteomic changes in small mesenteric and renal arteries in pre- and early-onset hypertension from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, which represents human primary hypertension. Compared with normotensive controls, mesenteric arteries from 12-week-old SHRs had 286 proteins that were significantly up- or downregulated, whereas 52 proteins were identified as up- or downregulated in mesenteric arteries from 6-week-old SHRs. Of these proteins, 18 were also similarly regulated in SHR renal arteries. Our pathway analyses reveal several novel pathways in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Finally, using a matrisome database, we identified 38 altered extracellular-matrix-associated proteins, many of which have never previously been associated with hypertension. Taken together, this study reveals novel proteins and mechanisms that are associated with early-onset hypertension, thereby providing novel insights into disease progression.
