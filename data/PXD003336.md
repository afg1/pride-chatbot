### Title
Xanthine Oxidoreductase mediates milk fat globule secretion.

### Description
Analysis of the milk fat globule proteome from mice with a mammary-specific knockout of Xanthine Oxidoreductase.

### Sample Protocol
Secreted milk fat globules were isolated from lactation day 10 mouse milk of wild-type and xanthine oxidoreductase mammary gland knockout dams.  Total proteins were precipitated, trypsinized and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis for protein composition.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were extracted from raw data files and converted into peak lists using an in-house script, PAVA (UCSF, MSF, San Francisco, CA). Peak lists were then independently searched against mouse SwissProt database using an in-house Mascotâ„¢ server (Version 2.2.06, Matrix Science).
