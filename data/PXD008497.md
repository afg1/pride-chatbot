### Title
Analysis of the TNFR1-SC from HOIP-proficient and -deficient A549 cells

### Description
This study aimed at determining which components of the TNFR1-SC are recruited in dependency of HOIP.

### Sample Protocol
TAP-purified TNFR1-SC followed by tryptic digestion.

### Data Protocol
Peptide mixtures were analysed by data dependent acquisition on the Q-Exactive Plus coupled to nLC. Data was searched by MaxQuant against the human UniProt database and proteins were filtered at a 1% false discovery rate.
