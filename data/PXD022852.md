### Title
Hologenome analysis reveals dual symbiosis in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent snail Gigantopelta aegis

### Description
To explore the symbiotic relationship in Gigantopelta aegis holobiont, the protein abundance of the symbiontic organ called oesophageal gland was identified by using metaproteomic approach.

### Sample Protocol
Methanol-chloroform method was used to extract and purify the proteins of oesophageal gland. Different sizes of proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE gel. Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano coupled with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) was used to analyse the proteins.

### Data Protocol
The raw MS data was analysed by using Mascot version 2.3.0.
