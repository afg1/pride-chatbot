### Title
Effect of Cpd1 on melanoma proteome

### Description
Investigation of the time dependent effect of Cpd1 (small molecule interactor) on the proteome composition of melanoma WM3734 line by label-free quantification using mass spectrometry. The goal was to identify which protein abundances are increased upon treatment with Cpd1. Melanoma cell line WM3734 was treated with Cpd1 and with the control DMSO. Samples were taken at two time points, 24h and 72h.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation and clean-up for LC-MS  For LC/MS proteomic analysis, 400,000 WM3734 cells were seeded per 10 cm dish and treated on day 4 with Cpd1 (10µM) or DMSO for 72 h. Cells were washed with PBS once. Then PBS was added to harvest cells with a cell scraper. Cells were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 4 min. The remaining pellets were resuspended in 120 µl lysis buffer [RIPA buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (cOmplete tablets, Roche Diagnostics)]. After a 30 min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant was stored at -80°C. The samples were next reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide and subsequently digested in the presence of sequencing grade LysC (Wako) and Trypsin (Promega). Finally the acidified tryptic digests were desalted on home-made 2 disc C18 StageTips as described (Rappsilber et al. 2007 ). After elution from the StageTips, samples were dried using a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf) and the peptides were taken up in 10 µL 0.1 % formic acid solution.  LC-MS/MS settings Experiments were performed on an Orbitrap Elite instrument (Thermo) (Michalski et al 2012 ) that was coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography (LC) system (Thermo). The LC was operated in the one-column mode. The analytical column was a fused silica capillary (75 µm × 30 cm) with an integrated PicoFrit emitter (New Objective) packed in-house with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin (Dr. Maisch). The analytical column was encased by a column oven (Sonation) and attached to a nanospray flex ion source (Thermo). The column oven temperature was adjusted to 45 °C during data acquisition. The LC was equipped with two mobile phases: solvent A (0.1% formic acid, FA, in water) and solvent B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile, ACN). All solvents were of UPLC grade (Sigma). Peptides were directly loaded onto the analytical column with a maximum flow rate that would not exceed the set pressure limit of 980 bar (usually around 0.6 – 1.0 µL/min). Peptides were subsequently separated on the analytical column by running a 140 min gradient of solvent A and solvent B (start with 7% B; gradient 7% to 35% B for 120 min; gradient 35% to 100% B for 10 min and 100% B for 10 min) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated using Xcalibur software (version 2.2 SP1.48). The mass spectrometer was set in the positive ion mode. Precursor ion scanning was performed in the Orbitrap analyzer (FTMS; Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry) in the scan range of m/z 300-1800 and at a resolution of 60000 with the internal lock mass option turned on (lock mass was 445.120025 m/z, polysiloxane; Olsen et al 2005 ). Product ion spectra were recorded in a data dependent fashion in the ion trap (ITMS) in a variable scan range and at a rapid scan rate. The ionization potential (spray voltage) was set to 1.8 kV. Peptides were analyzed using a repeating cycle consisting of a full precursor ion scan (3.0 × 106 ions or 50 ms) followed by 15 product ion scans (1.0 × 104 ions or 50 ms) where peptides are isolated based on their intensity in the full survey scan (threshold of 500 counts) for tandem mass spectrum (MS2) generation that permits peptide sequencing and identification. Collision induced dissociation (CID) energy was set to 35% for the generation of MS2 spectra. During MS2 data acquisition dynamic ion exclusion was set to 120 seconds with a maximum list of excluded ions consisting of 500 members and a repeat count of one. Ion injection time prediction, preview mode for the FTMS, monoisotopic precursor selection and charge state screening were enabled. Only charge states higher than 1 were considered for fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Peptide and Protein Identification using MaxQuant RAW spectra were submitted to an Andromeda (Cox et al 2011 ) search in MaxQuant (1.5.3.30) using the default settings.(Cox et al 2008 ) Label-free quantification and match-between-runs was activated (Cox et al 2014 ). The MS/MS spectra data were searched against the Uniprot human reference database (UP000005640_9606.fasta, 70244 entries). All searches included a contaminants database search (as implemented in MaxQuant, 245 entries). The contaminants database contains known MS contaminants and was included to estimate the level of contamination. Andromeda searches allowed oxidation of methionine residues (16 Da) and acetylation of the protein N-terminus (42 Da) as dynamic modifications and the static modification of cysteine (57 Da, alkylation with iodoacetamide). Enzyme specificity was set to “Trypsin/P” with two missed cleavages allowed. The instrument type in Andromeda searches was set to Orbitrap and the precursor mass tolerance was set to ±20 ppm (first search) and ±4.5 ppm (main search). The MS/MS match tolerance was set to ±0.5 Da. The peptide spectrum match FDR and the protein FDR were set to 0.01 (based on target-decoy approach). Minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids. For protein quantification unique and razor peptides were allowed. Modified peptides were allowed for quantification. The minimum score for modified peptides was 40. Label-free protein quantification was switched on, and unique and razor peptides were considered for quantification with a minimum ratio count of 2. Retention times were recalibrated based on the built-in nonlinear time-rescaling algorithm. MS/MS identifications were transferred between LC-MS/MS runs with the “match between runs” option in which the maximal match time window was set to 0.7 min and the alignment time window set to 20 min. The quantification is based on the “value at maximum” of the extracted ion current. At least two quantitation events were required for a quantifiable protein. Further analysis and filtering of the results was done in Perseus v1.5.5.1. (Tyanova et al 2016 ). For quantification we combined related biological replicates to categorical groups and investigated only those proteins that were found in at least one categorical group in a minimum of 5 out of 6 biological replicates. Comparison of protein group quantities (relative quantification) between different MS runs is based solely on the LFQ’s as calculated by MaxQuant (MaxLFQ algorithm) (Cox et al 2014)
