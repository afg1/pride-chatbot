### Title
Comprehensive proteomics analysis methods: Pre-Invasive Serous Lesions of the Endometrium and Fallopian Tube analyzed and compared

### Description
We present data from precancerous lesions from the endometrium and fallopian tube of a single patient. Using this complimentary approach, we gained a spatially defined representation of the molecular landscape within these tissue sections, and identified hundreds of proteins within the precancerous, and neighboring healthy regions. The method presented here represent a useful tool to maximize the amount of molecular data acquired from small sample sizes and even single cases, as shown here. Our initial data are indicative of a migratory phenotype in these lesions and warrant further research into their malignant capabilities.

### Sample Protocol
tryptic peptide MALDI MSI was performed on FFPE tissue and LC-MS/MS was used to identify the m/z values detected via MALDI MSI. matching of maldi msi and lc-ms/ms data was performed manually

### Data Protocol
Data was preprocessed and recalibrated using flexAnalysis software and the ion intensity images were created using the SCiLS lab 2016b. LC-MS/MS data was preprocessed and recalibrated using Bruker's datanalysis software and further identification was done using maxquant
