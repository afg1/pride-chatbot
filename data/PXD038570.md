### Title
Immunoprecipitated proteins using serum pools of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis

### Description
Different exploratory methods were used in search for autoantigens that can predict outcome of disease. Plasma pools from patient with and without uveitis were used for immunoprecipitation to filter out autoantigens that was then further analyzed in targeted arrays.

### Sample Protocol
A RIPA extract of WISH cells (human) were mixed with two different serum pools. Magnetic Protein G beads were used to isolate Ig from this mixture and bound antigens were eluted with low pH, precipitated in 90% EtOH and treated with dithioreitol (DTT) and iodoacetamide (IAA) and trypsinated. Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS on a fusion tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), operated in the positive data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed by Proteome Discoverer version 2.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and peptides were identified using SEQUEST HT against UniProtKB human database (released 20201109).
