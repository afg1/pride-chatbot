### Title
T-cell trans-synaptic vesicles are distinct and carry greater effector content than constitutive extracellular vesicles

### Description
The present dataset contains proteomics data from extracellular vesicles steadily released by donor matched, cultured human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and from extracellular vesicles released within the immunological synapse.

### Sample Protocol
T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 72h, then expanded using IL-2 100 U/mL in the absence of beads. Cells were split. One half was cultured in OptiMEM-I for isolation of EVs for no longer than 48h and the other half was cocultured with BSLBs to capture and isolate extracellular vesicles released in the immune synapse.

### Data Protocol
Side-by-side comparison of proteomics concealed in steadily released EVs and EVs released within the immunological synapse of donor matched, syngeneic, activated, and expanded primary CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells.
