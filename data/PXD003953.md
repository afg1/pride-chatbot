### Title
In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics - iPRG 2008 Swiss-Prot analysis

### Description
This dataset is no actual new study but the results of the benchmark of the iPRG2008 benchmark dataset used in the manuscript "In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics".

### Sample Protocol
For the exact sample procesing, please refer to http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/group.show/ProteomicsInformaticsResearchGroup.53.htm#786. Mouse samples were trypsin digested and the peptides labeled by four-plex iTRAQ and fractionated via strong cation exchange chromatography. The fractions were measured by LC-MS/MS on a 3200 QTrap, partially multiple times with exclusion lists, which resulted into 29 files. The resulting MGF files were combined into one file for peptide identification.

### Data Protocol
For the peptide identification a precursor and fragment tolerance of 0.45 Da and one missed cleavage were allowed. For the fixed modifications four-plex iTRAQ on K and N-termini as well as methylthio on C and for the variable modifications oxidation of M and protein N-terminal acetylation was used. as database, the mouse protein database provided for the iPRG2008 was used.
