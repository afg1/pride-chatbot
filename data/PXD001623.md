### Title
Bumblebee venom -  The genomes of two key bumblebee species with primitive eusocial organization

### Description
This experiment provide a comprehensive overview of proteins present in bumblebee venom.

### Sample Protocol
We analyzed the bumblebee Bombus terrestris venom proteome by integrating a combinatorial peptide ligand library (CPLL) with liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (LC-FTICR) MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Proteins have been identified using Mascot database searching. The protein database was assembled from the primary annotation of the bumblebee genome sequencing project
