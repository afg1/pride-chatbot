### Title
Identification of PNPase and RhlB  binding proteins in Deinococcus radiodurans

### Description
8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is a common RNA oxidation that has been implicated in carcinogenesis, neurodegeneration, and aging. Some? Many? RNA-binding proteins have shown binding preference for 8-oxoG modified RNA; such binding? can protect cells from oxidative stress. To date, the presence of specific 8-oxoG-recognizing proteins is only known in model organisms, but, how these proteins cooperate is still unclear. Here, we use RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to search for proteins that specifically bind 8-oxoG-modified RNA in Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremophilic bacterium with extraordinary resistance to oxidative stresses. We identified four proteins that selectively bind to oxidized RNA: polynucleotide phosphorylase (DR_2063/PNPase), ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase (DR_0335/RhlB), ribosomal protein S1 (DR_1983/RpsA), and transcriptional termination factor (DR_1338/Rho). The knockout of PNPase and RhlB in D. radiodurans caused increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and a significant accumulation of 8-oxoG modified RNA. Importantly, PNPase directly interacts with RhlB in D. radiodurans; however, no additional phenotypic effect was observed for the double deletion of pnp and rhlB compared to the individual single deletions. Overall, our findings suggest a role of the PNPase-RhlB complex in targeting 8-oxoG-modified RNAs for rapid degradation and thereby constitutes an important component of D. radiodurans resistance to oxidative stress.

### Sample Protocol
D. radiodurans R1 wild-type strain carrying His6 or His6 tagged PNPase and RhlB on pRADgro plasmid were grown to an OD600nm of 0.8 and treated with formaldehyde (1% w/v, room temperature for 15 min with continuous shaking) to facilitate the cross-linking. Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125 M to quench the cross-linking reaction. Cross-linked cells (50 mL) were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer (20 mM Na3PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4 with 1 mM PMSF). Cells were then resuspended and lysed by sonication (with an amplitude of 25%, alternating between 10 s on and 10 s off for 10 min on ice). After lysis, the crude extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For each His6-tag pull-down reaction, 1 mL cell-free extracts containing 500 μg protein were incubated with 50 µL of Ni-NTA Magnetic bead (New England BioLabs) for 30 min at room temperature. The protein-protein mixtures were then washed using 500 μL of wash buffer (20 mM Na3PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 with 1 mM PMSF) for three times and eluted using 20 μL of elution buffer (20 mM Na3PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 with 1 mM PMSF). To increase the yield, the elution step was repeated, and eluates combined. The protein samples were then concentrated by dialysis and subjected to LC-MS/MS or Western blotting analysis.

### Data Protocol
Proteins obtained from RNA affinity chromatography or co-immunopurification were resuspended in the SDS sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) Bromophenol blue, 0.05% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The mixtures were denatured at 95°C for 5 min and run ~3 mm into the 12% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad). After staining by Coomassie Bright Blue (Sigma-Aldrich‎), the protein bands were excised using a clean razor blade. The gel tubes were then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature, followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide in the dark for another 30 min. The gels were washed, rehydrated, and then digested by 10 ng/μL trypsin (ThermoFisher Scientific) overnight at 37˚C. Proteins was then extracted from the gels using 5% formic acid and 1:2 (v/v) 5% formic acid:acetonitrile. The samples were sent for LC-MS/MS analysis at the University of Texas ICMB proteomics facility. The resulting protein spectral counts were searched against the Uniprot D. radiodurans R1 (ATCC 13939) database using Sequest HT in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and normalized to total ion intensity. The identifications were validated with Scaffold v4.4.1 (Proteome Software) with greater than 99.0% probability and with a minimum of two peptides at 99.0% peptide probability. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set at 1% for peptides and 5% for protein identification. The difference between two strains/fractions was calculated using Student’s t-test and the P values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method [45].

### Publication Abstract
8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is a major RNA modification caused by oxidative stresses and has been implicated in carcinogenesis, neurodegeneration, and aging. Several RNA-binding proteins have been shown to have a binding preference for 8-oxoG-modified RNA in eukaryotes and protect cells from oxidative stress. To date, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is one of the most well-characterized proteins in bacteria that recognize 8-oxoG-modified RNA, but how PNPase cooperates with other proteins to process oxidized RNA is still unclear. Here, we use RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to search for proteins that preferably bind 8-oxoG-modified RNA in Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremophilic bacterium with extraordinary resistance to oxidative stresses. We identified four proteins that preferably bind to oxidized RNA: PNPase (DR_2063), DEAD box RNA helicase (DR_0335/RhlB), ribosomal protein S1 (DR_1983/RpsA), and transcriptional termination factor (DR_1338/Rho). Among these proteins, PNPase and RhlB exhibit high-affinity binding to 8-oxoG-modified RNA in a dose-independent manner. Deletions of PNPase and RhlB caused increased sensitivity of D. radiodurans to oxidative stress. We further showed that PNPase and RhlB specifically reduce the cellular availability of 8-oxoG-modified RNA but have no effect on oxidized DNA. Importantly, PNPase directly interacts with RhlB in D. radiodurans; however, no additional phenotypic effect was observed for the double deletion of <i>pnp</i> and <i>rhlB</i> compared to the single deletions. Overall, our findings suggest the roles of PNPase and RhlB in targeting 8-oxoG-modified RNAs and thereby constitute an important component of D. radiodurans resistance to oxidative stress. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Oxidative RNA damage can be caused by oxidative stress, such as hydrogen peroxide, ionizing radiation, and antibiotic treatment. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a major type of oxidized RNA, is highly mutagenic and participates in a variety of disease occurrences and development. Although several proteins have been identified to recognize 8-oxoG-modified RNA, the knowledge of how RNA oxidative damage is controlled largely remains unclear, especially in nonmodel organisms. In this study, we identified four RNA binding proteins that show higher binding affinity to 8-oxoG-modified RNA compared to unmodified RNA in the extremophilic bacterium <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, which can endure high levels of oxidative stress. Two of the proteins, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and DEAD-box RNA helicase (RhlB), interact with each other and reduce the cellular availability of 8-oxoG-modified RNA under oxidative stress. As such, this work contributes to our understanding of how RNA oxidation is influenced by RNA binding proteins in bacteria.
