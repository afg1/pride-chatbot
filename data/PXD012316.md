### Title
Phosphoproteomics of endothelin signalling

### Description
Time resolved phosphorylation changes were measured the melanoma cell lines A2058 and UACC257. An endothelin B receptor knockout of UACC257 was processed in parallel. Protein abundance was also compared at the latest time point of the study (90 min) using DIA-SWATH

### Sample Protocol
Cells were stimulated with EDN or PBS for 2 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min and 90 min and lysed in 8M Urea. Phosphoproteomics (DDA): A heavy SILAC labelled spike-in standard was produced in parallel to aid in quantification (K8/R10). After mixing heavy and light, samples were digested with Trypsin/Lys-C and subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2 as described in Zhou et al, 2013, Nature Protocols. Samples were measured on an Orbitrap Elite with 120 min gradients and a TOP15 DDA method. Proteome quantification (DIA-SWATH): No internal standard was added. 90 min lysates from the phosphoproteomics study were digested with Trypsin/Lys-C and and measured in DIA mode on a 6600 Triple TOF with a 90 min gradient and a custom 64 windows DIA-SWATH method.

### Data Protocol
Phosphoproteomics: Peptides were identified with the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline with the search engines: Comet, Myrimatch, X-Tandem and OMSSA. Datasets were filtered to peptide FDR 1% using iprophet. Phosphopeptides were quantified in Skyline based their MS1 heavy to light ratio. Phosphate localisation was assigned with Luciphor2 in parallel. Skyline and Luciphor results were merged in Excel. Proteome Quantification: Peak groups were identified using OpenSWATH and a pan human library. Peak groups were scored with pyprophet and aligned with TRIC. The OpenSWATH output was filtered to protein FDR 2% using the R package SWATH2stats. A protein matrix was generated with mapDIA.

### Publication Abstract
Endothelins (EDN) are peptide hormones that activate a GPCR signalling system and contribute to several diseases, including hypertension and cancer. Current knowledge about EDN signalling is fragmentary, and no systems level understanding is available. We investigated phosphoproteomic changes caused by endothelin B receptor (ENDRB) activation in the melanoma cell lines UACC257 and A2058 and built an integrated model of EDNRB signalling from the phosphoproteomics data. More than 5,000 unique phosphopeptides were quantified. EDN induced quantitative changes in more than 800 phosphopeptides, which were all strictly dependent on EDNRB. Activated kinases were identified based on high confidence EDN target sites and validated by Western blot. The data were combined with prior knowledge to construct the first comprehensive logic model of EDN signalling. Among the kinases predicted by the signalling model, AKT, JNK, PKC and AMP could be functionally linked to EDN-induced cell migration. The model contributes to the system-level understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of EDN signalling and supports the rational selection of kinase inhibitors for combination treatments with EDN receptor antagonists.
