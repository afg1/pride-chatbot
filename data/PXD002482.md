### Title
Conservation of mRNA and Protein Expression during Development of C.elegans

### Description
A detailed description of the sample processing is published (Grün et al., 2014 Cell Rep). Briefly, a super Silac Mix using Lys8 was generated and spiked into all samples as an internal reference. Total Lysate was fractionated using SDS-PAGES. Up to 16 fractions were collected per sample. Proteins were in gel digest using LysC only.

### Data Protocol
The data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.4.1.2 with standard settings. For this submission Protein FDR was set to 1 to search for evidences of predicted short ORFs.Conservation of mRNA and Protein Expression during Development of C.elegans
