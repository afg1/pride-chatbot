### Title
Targeted in situ cross-linking for determination of structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the cellular context

### Description
Discovery of host-pathogen intra-cellular interactions is critical for identification of mechanisms of infection and discovery. Affinity purification based on Mass Spectrometry (AP-MS) approaches can identify the host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network that includes hundreds of cellular proteins. For example, over 330 interactions were identified for SARS-CoV-2 major proteins. However, identification of the critical anchoring interactions directly induced by the viral proteins is still challenging. Here we developed a complete workflow of in-situ XL-MS followed by AP-MS, and employ it to investigate SARS-CoV2 protein inside the host cell. We focused on three Sars-Cov-2 proteins for which the structural information is either missing or incomplete: NSP1, NSP2, and the Nucleocapsid protein (N protein). AP-MS revealed that several human proteins were co-eluting with NSP1 and NSP2 while protein N eluted alone.

### Sample Protocol
We engineer a plasmid for constitutive expression of the protein with a Strep tag fused at one of the termini. We transfect human cells in culture with the plasmid, and allow 48 hours of expression. For control, we used non-transfected cells. The proteins of interest were purified from the lysate by StrepTactin beads then processed in standard mass spectrometry preparation. Mass spectrometry measurements were analyzed using MaxQuant for quantification and Perseus for statistical tests.

### Data Protocol
The RAW files (transfected cells versus non-transfected cells) were analyzed in a single computational run using MaxQuant software version 1.5. Default MaxQuant settings were used for data analysis, including label-free quantification (LFQ). For generation of the theoretical peptide library, a FASTA database containing all human proteins was downloaded from UniProt, and was augmented with the SARS-COV-2 proteins. Next, the output file was loaded to Perseus. We filter out the reverse proteins and contaminations and grouped the samples according to replicates. LFQ intensities were normalized to logarithmic scale, and missing values were imputed from normal distribution. We used a two-sample test, with a permutation-based FDR of 0.1% and ‘s0’ value of 2.

### Publication Abstract
Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per 20 residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and interdomain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryogenic electron microscopy structures. These results highlight the importance of cellular context for the structural probing of recalcitrant proteins and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted in situ CLMS and integrative modeling.
