### Title
Spore formation in a parasitic cnidarian: proteomic analysis of Ceratonova shasta (Cnidaria: Myxozoa)

### Description
Myxozoans are widely distributed aquatic obligate endoparasites that were recently recognized as belonging within the phylum Cnidaria. They have complex life cycles with waterborne transmission stages: resistant, infectious spores that are unique to myxozoans. However, little is known about the processes that give rise to these transmission stages. To understand the molecular underpinnings of spore formation, we conducted proteomics on Ceratonova shasta, a highly pathogenic myxozoan that causes severe mortalities in wild and hatchery-reared salmonid fishes. We compared proteomic profiles between developmental stages from inside the fish host, and the mature myxospore, which is released into the water where it drifts passively, ready to infect the next host. We found that C. shasta contains 2123 proteins; representing the first proteomic catalog of a myxozoan myxospore. Analysis of proteins differentially expressed between developing and mature spore stages uncovered processes that are active during spore formation. Our data highlight dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which provides myxozoan developmental stages with mobility through lamellipodia and filopodia, whereas in the mature myxospore the actin network supports F-actin stabilization that reinforces the transmission stage. These findings provide molecular insight into the myxozoan life cycle stages and, particularly, into the process of sporogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
C. shasta has different host-associated genotypes that differ in virulence (Atkinson and Bartholomew, 2010; Stinson et al., 2018; Alama-Bermejo et al., 2020). Genotype IIR infections are highly virulent and become systemic, inducing the production of large volumes of ascites in the body cavity of susceptible rainbow trout. This fluid is rich in different developmental stages of C. shasta (pre-sporogonic and sporogonic) and an easy source of a large amount of parasites. In this study, we used genotype IIR C. shasta  from rainbow trout that had been infected by intraperitoneal injection of parasites from a donor fish (Atkinson et al., 2018b). Ascites (2-7 mL/fish) was collected by syringe from the abdominal cavity of five infected fish, then individually centrifuged, and the pellets suspended in PBS and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded and the sample pellets frozen and lyophilized. From three fish, mature myxospores were isolated from intestine samples. Because of limited material, only three biological samples of myxospores were purified using a Percol gradient as described (Piriatinskiy et al., 2017); each sample contained about 2 million myxospores.  Proteolysis of developmental stages, and mature myxospores was performed for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with 1% SDS. Then, 0.1 M DTT was added for 30 min at 60oC and the samples were modified with 0.4 M iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at RT and precipitated with 80% acetone. The resultant pellet was suspended in buffer (9 M urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate) and digested in 1 M urea, 0.06 mM ammonium bicarbonate with modified trypsin (Promega) at a 1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio overnight at 37oC. The tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 tips (Toptip, Glygen), dried and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. Two ï�­g of the resultant peptides were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography on 0.075 X 180-mm fused silica capillaries (J&W) packed with Reprosil reversed phase material (Dr Maisch GmbH, Germany). The peptides were eluted with linear 120 min gradient of 5 to 28%, 15 min gradient of 28 to 95% and 15 min at 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.15 Î¼l/min. Mass spectrometry was performed with Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a positive mode using repetitively full MS scan, followed by collision-induces dissociation (HCD) of the 10 dominant ions selected from the first MS scan.

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometry data from the biological replicates were label-free analyzed and quantified using MaxQuant (ver. 1.5.2.8) against the Oncorhynchus mykiss proteins from Uniprot (accessed Dec 20, 2017) and against the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of the C. shasta transcriptome IIR RBT6 cs neither assembly (Alama-Bermejo et al., 2020)), with 1% FDR. The ORFs were generated using TransDecoder (https://transdecoder.github.io/), set at a minimum length of 30 amino acids. C. shasta identified ORFs were clustered using CD-hit (Fu et al., 2012), to remove redundant identical ORFs or segments of larger ORFs. When several ORFs were detected in a single transcript, only ORFs with length â‰¥ 50% of the longest detected ORF were selected. C. shasta proteins annotation and interpro domains were obtained using Blast2GO (ver. 5.1.12) (default settings â€“02.2019) and using blastp, protein homologs of Mus musculus were identified for STRING analysis.
