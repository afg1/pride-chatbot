### Title
Complexome Profiling of the mitochondrial proteome from Viscum album

### Description
Viscum album is known for its special mode of cellular respiration. It lacks the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex (complex I of the respiratory chain) and has restricted capacities to generate mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We here present an investigation of the V. album energy metabolism taking place in mitochondria. Mitochondria were purified from young V. album leaves and membrane bound protein complexes characterized by Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as by the complexome profiling approach. Proteins were systematically identified by label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes of Viscum album leaf mitochondria were separated by 1D Blue native (BN) polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (PAGE) as described in [1]. A 1D BN gel lane was cut horizontally into 54 slices of about 10 mm in widths and 3 mm height. Gel slices were then further processed for MS analysis by tryptic in-gel digestion and peptide extraction as described before [2]. Peptide extracts were taken up in 20 Âµl sample buffer (5% [v/v] acetonitrile 0.1% [v/v] trifluoroacetic acid) and transferred to liquid-chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis. For LC, an Ultimate 3000 UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) was used. 5 Âµl of each sample were loaded onto a C18 reverse phase trapping column, length 2 cm, ID 75 Âµm, particle diameter 3 Âµm, pore size 100 Ã… (Acclaim PepMap100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). Subsequently, peptides were separated on a C18 reverse phase analytical column, length 50 cm, ID 75 Âµm, particle diameter 3 Âµm, pore size 100 Ã… (Acclaim PepMap100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) applying a non-linear 5% [v/v] to 30% [v/v] acetonitrile (ACN) gradient in 0.1% [v/v] formic acid at a column oven temperature of 33Â°C over a period of 70 min and a flow rate of 5 Âµl min-1. Finally, the ACN concentration was increased up to 95% [v/v] within 10 min and kept for another 10 min to clean the column. Column equilibration was performed at 5% [v/v] ACN for 10 min. Eluting peptides were directly transferred to a Nano-Spray-Ionization (NSI) source using stainless steel nano-pore emitters of an Orbitrap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). Spray voltage was set to 2.2 kV, capillary temperature to 275Â°C and S-lens RF level to 50%. MS/MS spectra (top 10) were recorded from 20 to 80 min with the MS running in positive mode. For full MS scans, the number of microscans was set to 1, resolution to 70000, AGC target to 1e6, maximum injection time to 400 msec, number of scan ranges to 1, scan range to 400 to 1600 m/z and the spectrum data type to â€œProfileâ€�. For dd-MS2, the number of microscans was set to 1, resolution to 17500, AGC target to 1e5, maximum injection time to 250 msec, loop count to 10, MSX count to 1, isolation window to 3.0 m/z, fixed first mass to 100.0 m/z, NCE to 27 (stepped NCE deactivated) and the spectrum data type to â€œProfileâ€�. The data dependent (dd) settings were set to: Intensity threshold, 4.2e3; apex trigger, 10 to 60 sec; charge exclusion, unassigned, 1, 5-8, >8; peptide match, preferred; exclude isotypes, on; dynamic exclusion 45.0 sec.

### Data Protocol
MS raw files generated by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) were evaluated via MaxQuant version 2.1.4.0 [3]. Peptide spectra were queried against the Viscum album gene space II (VaGs II) database (https://viscumalbum.pflanzenproteomik.de/, SchrÃ¶der et al. 2022a). The following parameters were used for MS data analyses: Digestions mode: Specific; Enzyme: Trypsin/P; Maximum missed cleavage sites: 2; Variable modifications: Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term); Maximum number of modifications per peptide: 5. Global parameters were set to: minimal peptide length: 7; maximum peptide mass: 4600 [Da]; fixed modification: Carbamidomethyl (C). The peptide-to-spectrum match (PSM) and the false discovery rates (FDR) were set to 1% for protein identification. The default value of 1 were used for minimum number of peptides, razor peptides and unique peptides (0) of the protein group identification. To accurately quantify proteins within fractions for complexome profiling, calculation of intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) was activated [4]. The remaining settings were left at the default values. Complexome profiling was performed using the NOVA software (Version 0.5.8) [5] using the iBAQ values from the â€œproteinGroupsâ€� output file generated by MaxQuant. Values were normalized via â€œmaximum normalizationâ€� for hierarchical clustering which was performed via the Pearson Correlation distance function and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetical Mean) average linkage. The Viscum album ComplexomeMap was created at https://complexomemap.de/ [6]. [3] Tyanova S, Temu T, Cox J.

### Publication Abstract
The hemiparasitic flowering plant <i>Viscum album</i> (European mistletoe) is known for its very special life cycle, extraordinary biochemical properties, and extremely large genome. The size of its genome is estimated to be 30 times larger than the human genome and 600 times larger than the genome of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. To achieve insights into the Gene Space of the genome, which is defined as the space including and surrounding protein-coding regions, a transcriptome project based on PacBio sequencing has recently been conducted. A database resulting from this project contains sequences of 39,092 different open reading frames encoding 32,064 distinct proteins. Based on 'Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs' (BUSCO) analysis, the completeness of the database was estimated to be in the range of 78%. To further develop this database, we performed a transcriptome project of <i>V. album</i> organs harvested in summer and winter based on Illumina sequencing. Data from both sequencing strategies were combined. The new <i>V. album</i> Gene Space database II (VaGs II) contains 90,039 sequences and has a completeness of 93% as revealed by BUSCO analysis. Sequences from other organisms, particularly fungi, which are known to colonize mistletoe leaves, have been removed. To evaluate the quality of the new database, proteome data of a mitochondrial fraction of <i>V. album</i> were re-analyzed. Compared to the original evaluation published five years ago, nearly 1000 additional proteins could be identified in the mitochondrial fraction, providing new insights into the Oxidative Phosphorylation System of <i>V. album</i>. The VaGs II database is available at https://viscumalbum.pflanzenproteomik.de/. Furthermore, all <i>V. album</i> sequences have been uploaded at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
