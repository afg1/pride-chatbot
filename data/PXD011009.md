### Title
Limits for resolving isobaric tandem mass tag reporter ions using phase constrained spectrum deconvolution

### Description
A popular method for peptide quantification relies on isobaric labeling such as tandem mass tags (TMT) which enables multiplexed proteome analyses. Quantification is achieved by reporter ions generated by fragmentation in a tandem mass spectrometer. However, with higher degrees of multiplexing, the smaller mass differences between the reporter ions increase the mass resolving power requirements. This contrasts with faster peptide sequencing capabilities enabled by lowered mass resolution on Orbitrap instruments. It is therefore important to determine the mass resolution limits for highly multiplexed quantification when maximizing proteome depth. Here we defined the lower boundaries for resolving TMT reporter ions with 0.0063 Da mass differences using an ultra-high-field Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We found the optimal method depends on the relative ratio between closely spaced reporter ions and that 64 ms transient acquisition time provided sufficient resolving power for separating TMT reporter ions with absolute ratio changes up to 16-fold. Furthermore, a 32 ms transient processed with phase-constrained spectrum deconvolution provides >50% more identifications with >99% quantified, but with a slight loss in quantification precision and accuracy. These findings should guide decisions on what Orbitrap resolution settings to use in future proteomics experiments relying on isobaric TMT reporter ion quantification.

### Sample Protocol
Lys-C protease (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, USA) was added at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) and digested for 2 hours at 37 °C. The concentration of Gnd-HCl was reduced to less than 1M with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate prior to the addition of trypsin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) at a ratio of 1:50 and allowed to digest overnight at 37 °C. After digestion, the sample was acidified using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a 1% final concentration in order to quench protease activity followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 4000 g to remove residual cell debris. Supernatant was cleared of all salts/buffers and tryptic peptides were purified using solid phase extraction on C18 Sep-Pak (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) by gravity. Peptides were eluted with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid (FA). Peptides were dried and ACN was removed from the peptide containing sample by SpeedVac (Eppendorf, Germany) at 45°C. Peptide concentration was measured using a NanoDrop™ 2000 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).

### Data Protocol
All raw files were analyzed in one combined analysis using the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.6.1.2) with the integrated Andromeda search engine, where each raw file was configured as a separate experiment.24 For the search, fixed modifications were set to carbamylation of cysteines and TMT-10 were specified as label on N-terminal and lysines residues with mass tolerance set to 0.003 Da. Variable modifications were set to oxidation of methionines, protein N-terminal acetylation, deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, and pyro-glutamate formation from N-terminal glutamine. The database was the UniProt human reference proteome release 2018_02 without isoforms containing 21,010 protein sequences. In addition, the included contaminant database from MaxQuant contains enzymes and common contaminants. FDR was set to 1% on the PSM, site, and protein level. Otherwise default values were used.

### Publication Abstract
A popular method for peptide quantification relies on isobaric labeling such as tandem mass tags (TMT), which enables multiplexed proteome analyses.
