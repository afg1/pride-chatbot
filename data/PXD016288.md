### Title
Acesta excavata gill symbiont microbial communities from a Lophelia reef in the Norwegian Sea

### Description
Characterisation of a deep-water Endozoicomonadaceae

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, proteins from Haltenbanken clam gill tissue were extracted using phenol, sucrose glass beads FastPrep and precipitated with ammonium acetate. Following in-gel trypsin digestion proteins were analysed using nanoLC-MS/MS and MaxQuant.

### Data Protocol
MS files were searched against all predicted proteins from the genome with parameters as previously described (Hagen et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2017).
