### Title
Tandem mass tag labeling to characterize muscle-specific proteome change in beef during early postmortem

### Description
Bovine longissimus lumborum (LL) and psoas major (PM) muscles biopsy samples were collected from four carcasses (n = 4) at 45 min, 12 h, and 36 h postmortem from a commercial beef processing facility. Proteome profile variation between beef LL and PM during the early postmortem period were evaluated by tandem mass tag labeling containing ten different isobaric compounds.

### Sample Protocol
Samples originated from 4 animals, 2 tissue types (LL & PM) at 3 timepoints post-mortem. Approximately 200mg of 24 beef samples were submitted for Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) 10plex labeling, peptide fractionation and protein identification & quantitation via LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data acquired from mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Velos Pro, Thermo Fisher Scientific) combined with a Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific). Compound lists of the resulting spectra were generated using Xcalibur 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific). Tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted and deisotoped by ProteoWizard MsConvert (version 3.0). Spectra from all samples were searched using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.6.0) against the Uniprot_Bovine_rev_020518 database (48676 entries). Scaffold software (version Scaffold_4.8.4, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used for identification.

### Publication Abstract
Bovine <i>longissimus lumborum</i> (LL) and <i>psoas major</i> (PM) muscles biopsy samples were collected from four carcasses (<i>n</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;4) at 45&#x202f;min, 12&#x202f;h, and 36&#x202f;h postmortem from a commercial beef processing facility. Proteins present in the early postmortem LL and PM proteomes were identified and quantified using tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled, fractionated peptides coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The data are supplied in this article and are related to "Tandem mass tag labeling to characterize muscle-specific proteome changes in beef during early postmortem period" by Zhai et&#xa0;al. [1].
