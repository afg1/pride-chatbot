### Title
Insulin stimulated MCF7 breast cancer cells

### Description
Proteome profile of MCF7 breast cancer cells stimulated with insulin and analyzed by nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS.

### Sample Protocol
MCF7 cells were cultured in EMEM with insulin (10 microgram/mL) and FBS (10 %), harvested at 70-80 % confluence, lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, digested with trypsin (substrate:enzyme ratio 50:1 w/w), and analyzed by nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS interfaced to an LTQ Thermo Electron ion trap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4, using  a Homo Sapiens protein database from UniProt (2015/20199 entries), minimum peptide length 6 amino acids, maximum peptide length 144, smallest mass 500 Da, largest mass 5000 Da, 2 missed cleavages allowed, precursor ion tolerance 2 Da, fragment ion tolerance 1 Da, FDR stringent 1%, FDR relaxed 3 %.

### Publication Abstract
The proteome data provided in this article were acquired from MCF7 breast cancer cells stimulated with insulin, and were generated by using a 2D-SCX (strong cation exchange)/RPLC (reversed phase liquid chromatography) separation protocol followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) detection. To facilitate data re-processing by more advanced search engines and the extraction of additional information from already existing files, both raw and processed data are provided. The sample preparation, data acquisition and processing protocols are described in detail. The raw data relate to work published in "Proteome profile of the MCF7 cancer cell line: a mass spectrometric evaluation" (Sarvaiya et al., 2006) [1] and are made available through the PRIDE (PRoteomics IDEntifications)/ProteomeXchange public repository with identifier PRIDE: PXD004051 ("2016 update of the PRIDE database and tools" (Vizcaino et al., 2016) [2]).
