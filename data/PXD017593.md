### Title
Comparative proteomic analysis of Nicotiana benthamiana plants under CWMV infection

### Description
Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) is a severe threat to winter wheat, but the mechanism of the viral pathogenic mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, a LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomics was conducted to analyze the proteomic changes of CWMV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana compared to mock plants. In total, 2,751 identified host proteins were identified, 1,496 of which were quantified. 146 up-regulated and 248 down-regulated proteins were characterized as differently accumulated proteins (DAPs)

### Sample Protocol
a label-free proteomic analysis of N. benthamiana under CWMV infection. A certain number of DAPs were identified. We also found CWMV infection suppressed ABA signaling pathway while ABA application induced plants resistance against CWMV. Combined with VIGS technology, we found that silencing NbABA1 or NbABA2 could increase CWMV accumulation.

### Data Protocol
a total of 306,662 spectrum, 93,916 matched spectrum, 12,845 peptides, 9,291 unique peptides, 2,751 identified proteins and 1,496 quantifiable proteins were obtained by this label-free analysis
