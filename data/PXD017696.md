### Title
Comprehensive quantitative analysis of the proteome of Leishmania (Viannia) species

### Description
Leishmania species are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, denominated Leishmaniasis, affecting over 12 million people worldwide. During the last decade, there have been impressive efforts for sequencing the genome of most of the pathogenic Leishmania spp. as well as hundreds of strains, but large-scale proteomic analyses did not follow these achievements and Leishmania proteome remained mostly uncharacterized. Here, we report a comprehensive comparative study of the proteomes of L. braziliensis, L. panamensis and L. guyanensis. Proteins extracted by SDS-mediated lysis were processed following the multi-enzyme digestion-filter aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure and analysed by high accuracy mass spectrometry. “Total Protein Approach” and “Proteomic Ruler” were applied for absolute quantification of proteins. Principal component analysis demonstrated very high reproducibility among biological replicates and a very clear differentiation of the three species. Our dataset comprises near 7000 proteins, representing the most complete Leishmania proteome yet known, and provides a quantitative picture of the proteomes of the three species in terms of protein concentration and copy numbers. We describe the abundance of proteins from the major energy metabolic processes, highlighting the main differences among the species. In addition, we provide quantitative data about different membrane proteins, transporters, and lipids, all of which delineate significant differences among those species and provide rich substrate for explore new molecules for diagnosing purposes.

### Sample Protocol
Parasites were lysed in a buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0,05 M DTT and 2% SDS in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After chilling to room temperature, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 5 min. Aliquots containing 50 µg total protein were processed by the MED-FASP (Multi-Enzyme Digestion - Filter Aided Sample Preparation) method using consecutively LysC and trypsin. Peptides were collected, concentrated and desalted on a C18 reverse phase column

### Data Protocol
The spectra were searched using MaxQuant software. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages was allowed. The maximum false peptide and protein discovery rate was specified as 0.01.
