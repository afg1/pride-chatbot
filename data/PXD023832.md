### Title
Rnmt cKO vs control activated CD4 T cell ribo Mega-SEC

### Description
We aimed to identify how loss of the cap methyltransferase RNMT affected the ribosomes and ribosome-associated proteins in activated CD4 T cells.

### Sample Protocol
CD4 T cells were enriched using the easy-sep magnet system. Monosomes and polysomes were fractionated following the Ribo Mega-SEC protocol and analysed on a Q-exactive plus.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was analysed in Maxquant using the mouse Swissprot database for peptide identification. iBAQ scores for each protein were used for further analysis in R. The datasets were analysed with limma using the sum of iBAQ scores for normalisation and fold changes and statistical significance were calculated for comparisons between control and Rnmt cKO samples within each fraction.
