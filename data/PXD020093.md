### Title
Effect of dietary replacement of fish  meal with spent brewer’s waste on the muscle proteome profile of the Indian major carp Labeo rohita

### Description
The effect of dietary replacement of fish  meal with spent brewer’s waste was evaluated by investigating the changes in muscle proteome profile of the Indian major carp Labeo rohita

### Sample Protocol
Muscle tissues from euthanized Labeo rohita of both control and experimental groups were collected in ice. 1gm of tissue was weighed and ground in 50mM Tris Buffer + PIC + PMSF and the samples were centrifuged at 14000rpm. The supernatant obtained was collected into a separate tube (Tris Buffer extract). Then the pellet was mixed with urea lysis buffer was added and centrifuged and the resultant supernatant was mixed with the tris buffer extract.

### Data Protocol
Liquid chromatography was performed on a ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, UK ). The separation of all samples was performed on ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column(Waters,UK)(150mm X 2.1mm X 1.7µm).A gradient elution program was run for the chromatographic separation with mobile phase A (0.1% Formic Acid in WATER), and mobile phase B(0.1% formic Acid in ACETONITRILE). A SYNAPT G2 QTOF (Waters, UK ) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used for mass spectrometric detection. Sample analysis were performed in positive mode. The raw data acquired from the instrument was processed using PLGS software 3.0.2 within which Data Processing and Database search was performed. The source of the sample being Rat Proteins for samples: Con and Exp, the protein database was downloaded from database (Uniprot: Actinopterygii) and used for searching the proteins present in the sample. 3 runs of the sample was processed using the following search parameters in the software: Peptide tolerance (ppm) : 50; Fragment Tolerance (ppm): 100; Min no. of Fragment matches for Peptides : 2; Min no. of Fragment matches for Proteins : 5; Min no. of Peptide matches for Proteins : 2; Missed Cleavages: 1; Modification: Carbamidomethyl_c, Oxidation_m

### Publication Abstract
Brewer's spent yeast (BSY) is among the most voluminous by-products generated in brewery industry that adds to the waste; however, smart utilization of BSY could lead to edible biomass production besides waste management. To utilize it for biomass production, it is being used in fish feeds; however, its effect on the fish physiology has been scantily studied. The present study investigated the proteomic changes in muscle tissues of carp Labeo rohita fed with BSY-based diet, to understand its impact on muscle physiology and biomass. Six feeds were prepared with different grades of BSY (0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100% replacement of fishmeal with BSY) and fishes were fed for 90&#xa0;days. Highest weight gain%, feed conversion efficiency, specific growth rate% were observed in 30% BSY-replaced group and this group was considered for the proteomic study. Comparative shotgun proteomic analysis was carried out by LC-MS/MS and data generated have been deposited in ProteomeXchange Consortium with dataset identifier PXD020093. A total of 62 proteins showed differential abundance; 29 increased and 33 decreased in the 30% BSY-replaced group. Pathway analysis using IPA and Panther tools revealed that the proteins tyrosine protein kinase, PDGF&#x3b1;, PKRCB and Collagen promote muscle growth by inducing the PI3K-AKT pathway. Conversely, the proteins Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase, Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate5-phosphatase 2A and Ras-specific guanine- nucleotide-releasing factor inhibit muscle growth indicating that 30% BSY-replaced feed promote muscle growth in a highly controlled manner. Findings suggest that BSY could be recycled for carp feed production in large scale thereby leading to resource conservation, reducing environmental effects.
