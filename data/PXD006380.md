### Title
Calcineurin-regulated Phosphopeptide(30 min) and CaN-regulated dephosphopeptide(10 min) researchs in Pheromone gland of  Helicoverpa armigera

### Description
Calcineurin-regulated Phosphopeptide(30 min) and CaN-regulated dephosphopeptide(10 min) researchs used Itraq method in Pheromone gland of Helicoverpa armigera

### Sample Protocol
Newly-emerged females were first decapitated, and then maintained for 24 hours. PGs were collected from the decapitated females and incubated at room temperature with Grace’s Insect Medium containing 5 μM cyclosporine A. After 1 h waiting time, medium was replaced with fresh Grace’s Insect Medium containing 10 pmol PBAN and 5 μM CysA. samples were collected after 30 min of PBAN treatment, samples were subjected to Protein extraction. Control females were incubated  without CysA.          Newly emerged females were decapitated, and maintained for 24 h to remove endogenous PBAN. PGs were then dissected and incubated with Grace’s Insect   Medium (containing 5 μM cyclosporine A). After 1 h of incubation, the medium were replaced by the fresh Grace’s Insect Medium containing 5 μM CysA and 10 pmol PBAN. PG samples were collected after 10 min of PBAN incubation, and samples were subjected to Protein extraction. Control females were incubated without calcineurin inhibitor.         All samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (4% SDS, 1 mM DTT, 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, protease inhibitor). After 3 min incubation in boiling water, the homogenate was sonicated on ice. The crude extract was then incubated in boiling water again and clarified by centrifugation at 16000 x g at 25°C for 10 min. Protein content was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Beyotime). The supernatants were stored at -80℃ until use.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were searched using MASCOT engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.2) embedded into Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Electron,   San Jose, CA.)against RNA-seq  database. For protein identification, the following options were used. Peptide mass tolerance=20 ppm, MS/MS tolerance=0.1 Da, Enzyme=Trypsin, Missed cleavage=2, Fixed modification: Carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ8plex (K), iTRAQ8plex (N-term), Variable modification: Oxidation (M),  Phosphorylation (S/T/Y), FDR ≤0.01.           The phosphorylation peptides were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA.). pRS score above 50 indicate a good PSM (Peptide Spectrum Matches) and pRS probabilities above 75 percent indicate that a site is truly phosphorylated.

### Publication Abstract
Chemical signaling plays a critical role in the behavior and physiology of many animals. Female insects, as many other animals, release sex pheromones to attract males for mating. The evolutionary and ecological success of insects therefore hinges on their ability to precisely mediate (including initiation and termination) pheromone biosynthesis. Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) acts directly on pheromone glands to regulate sex pheromone production using Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cyclic-AMP as secondary messengers in the majority of species. However, the molecular mechanism downstream of the secondary messengers has not yet been elucidated in heliothine species. The present study shows that calcineurin, protein kinase A (PKA) and acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) are key components involved in PBAN-induced sex pheromone biosynthesis in <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> using PBAN-dependent phosphoproteomics in combination with transcriptomics. RNAi-mediated knockdown and inhibitor assay demonstrated that calcineurin A is required for PBAN-induced ACC activation and sex pheromone production. Calcineurin-dependent phosphoproteomics and <i>in vitro</i> calcineurin phosphorylation assay further revealed that calcineurin regulated ACC activity by dephosphorylating ser84 and ser92. In addition, PKA-dependent phosphoproteomics and activity analysis revealed that PKA reduces the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of ACC by phosphorylating the conserved ser92. Taken together, our findings indicate that calcineurin acts as the downstream signal of PBAN/G-protein receptor/Ca<sup>2+</sup> to activate ACC through dephosphorylation while inactivating AMPK via PKA to reduce ACC phosphorylation, thus facilitating calcineurin activation of ACC.
