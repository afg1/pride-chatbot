### Title
Identification of a novel poly-n-acetyllactosamine counterreceptor for galectin-8 on HL-60 cells, Basigin

### Description
Using a single carbohydrate recognition domain of gal-8 on the C-terminus or full-length gal-8, we performed affinity chromatography followed by a proteomic approach with HL-60 cell membrane preparations to isolate and identify putative ligands.

### Sample Protocol
Affinity chromatography was performed as indicated above, beginning the incubation with 8 ml of HL-60 membrane preparation with 3 ml of gal-8-beads or gal-8C-beads (10 mg/ml) in a 15 ml polypropylene tube under rotation for 1 h at 4°C. Solution was poured on a 10 ml glass wool column. Fractions were electrophoresed as described above. Coomassie brilliant blue stainable bands of high molecular weight (75 kDa to 250 kDa) were excised. In-gel digestion with trypsin, liquid chromatography and coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) sequencing were performed.

### Data Protocol
The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against a concatenated target-decoy human RefSeq (release 54 – July 12, 2012 – 34421 target proteins) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the SEQUEST Sorcerer algorithm (version 4.0.3, SAGE-N) searching parameters included partially tryptic restriction, parent ion mass tolerance (± 50 ppm), dynamic modification of oxidized Met (+15.9949 Da). The peptides were classified by charge state and tryptic state (fully and partial) and filtered dynamically by increasing XCorr and ΔCn values to reduce protein false discovery rate to less than 1%, according to the target-decoy strategy
