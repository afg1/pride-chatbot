### Title
BRCA mutational status shapes the stromal microenvironment of pancreatic cancer linking CLU+ CAF expression with HSF1 signaling

### Description
This project aimed to assess how cancer cell intrinsic brca2 mutations shape the tumor stromal landscape.

### Sample Protocol
Serum depleted CM was collected from 8 KPC-shControl and 8 KPC-shBrca2 organoid cultures following 4 days in culture. Samples were concentrated anddenatured using urea and subjected  to tryptic digestion.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed using MaxQuant version 2.0.1. Data was searched against the mouse  protein sequences from UniprotKB. Quantification was based on the LFQ method, based on all peptides.
