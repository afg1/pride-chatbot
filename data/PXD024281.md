### Title
Lactate Dehydrogenase B and Pyruvate Oxidation Pathway associated with Carfilzomib-Related Cardiotoxicity in Multiple Myeloma Patients: Result of a Multi-Omics Integrative Analysis

### Description
In this project we hypothesized that a multi-omics approach integrating data from different omics would provide insights into the mechanisms of CFZ-related cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs).

### Sample Protocol
Global proteomic profiling was performed on the plasma samples using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) high-throughput proteomic method on these 13 MM patients treated with CFZ to identify proteomic biomarkers associated with CFZ-CVAEs.

### Data Protocol
For quantification, only MS/MS spectra that were unique to a particular peptide, and the sum of the signal-to-noise ratios for all the peak pairs > 9 were used. The ratios with p < 0.05 present in at least two replicates were considered significant. Only the significant ratios from the replicates were used to calculate the average ratio for the protein
