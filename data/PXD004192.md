### Title
Hoxa9 and Meis1 cooperatively induce addiction to Syk signaling by suppressing miR-146a in acute myeloid leukemia

### Description
The transcription factor Meis1 drives myeloid leukemogenesis in the context of Hox gene overexpression but is currently considered undruggable. We therefore investigated whether myeloid progenitor cells transformed by Hoxa9 and Meis1 become addicted to targetable signaling pathways. A comprehensive (phospho)proteomic analysis revealed that Meis1 increased Syk protein expression and activity. Syk upregulation occurs through a Meis1-dependent feed-forward loop. By dissecting this loop, we show that Syk is a direct target of miR-146a, whose expression is indirectly regulated by Meis1 through the transcription factor PU.1. In the context of Hoxa9 overexpression, Syk induces Meis1, recapitulating several leukemogenic features of Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia. Finally, we show that Syk inhibition disrupts the identified regulatory loop, prolonging survival of mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia.

### Sample Protocol
For enrichment of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, SILAC-labelled H and H/M cells were lysed in 8M urea buffer. Resulting proteins were mixed 1:1 according to protein concentration and then subjected to immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine containing peptides using pY1000 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) according to manufacturer’s instruction. All eluted peptides were desalted using a self-made C18 stage-tip and then dried in a SpeedVac. For each sample, two technical replicates were analysed by mass spectrometry. For the global phosphoproteome analysis, digested peptides were resuspended in an incubation buffer (80% ACN, 5% TFA, 5% glycerol) and incubated with TiO2 beads (10 µm, GL Science, Japan) at a 1:8 peptide:bead ratio (w/w) with end-over-end rotation at 37 °C for 20 min. The peptide concentration was maintained at around 2 mg/ml during the incubation. After incubation, all TiO2 beads were loaded onto an empty spin column (5 µm frit, Hoefer Inc.) and washed three times each with incubation buffer, 80% ACN, 5% TFA and 60% ACN, 0.1% FA. Phosphopeptides were then eluted with 1 M 2,2'-(propane-1,3-diyldiimino)bis[2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol in 0.5 N NH4OH (pH ≥10.5) and acidified immediately with 10% FA. The eluate was desalted on a C18 spin column and fractionated using basic pH reverse phase chromatography (XBridge C18 3.5 µm, 150 x 1.0 mm, Waters). LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer coupled with Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System (Dionex).

### Data Protocol
The MS raw files were processed by MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) and MS/MS spectra were searched against UniProt human database (downloaded on Feb, 2015; 89,796 entries) via the Andromeda search engine. Mass tolerance after recalibration of precursor mass and fragment ion mass were set as 6 and 20 ppm, respectively. Allowed variable modifications included protein deamidation (N), oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (STY). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was defined as a fixed modification. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids with the maximum of two enzymatic mis-cleavages. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for both peptide and protein identifications. Intensities of all identified peptides were determined by MaxQuant with options “match between runs” and “re-quantify”.   Subsequent data analysis was conducted with Perseus (version 1.5.2.4). After removing all decoy hits and potential contaminant entries, identified phosphosites with lower than 0.75 of localization probability were filtered out. All SILAC ratios were log2 transformed and those with absolute log2 Z score >1 were considered significantly regulated.

We therefore investigated whether myeloid progenitor cells transformed by Hoxa9 and Meis1 become addicted to targetable signaling pathways. A comprehensive (phospho)proteomic analysis revealed that Meis1 increased Syk protein expression and activity. Syk upregulation occurs through a Meis1-dependent feedback loop. By dissecting this loop, we show that Syk is a direct target of miR-146a, whose expression is indirectly regulated by Meis1 through the transcription factor PU.1. In the context of Hoxa9 overexpression, Syk signaling induces Meis1, recapitulating several leukemogenic features of Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia. Finally, Syk inhibition disrupts the identified regulatory loop, prolonging survival of mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia.
