### Title
Proteomic Investigation of Factors Driving Resistance and/or Resilience to Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease

### Description
Floridaâ€™s coral reefs are currently experiencing a multi-year disease-related mortality event, that has resulted in massive die-offs in multiple coral species. Coral monitoring data and disease prevention/treatment efforts from recent years have identified individual Orbicella faveolata that possess high, moderate, or low resistance to stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD).  Ninety samples of high, moderate, or low SCTLD resistance were collected from 3 reefs for bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis (n=30 for each resistance category).

### Sample Protocol
Samples were collected and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Once in the lab, samples were thawed and submerged in 5% SDS in 50mM TEAB and tip sonicated on ice.  Protein concetration was determined with BCA assay.  Twenty micrograms of protein was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with calcium acetamide, and digested with trypsin via S-traps.  Pepetide concentration was determined with quantitative fluorometric assay. Two picomoles of peptides were separated and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on Orbitrap Eclipse in a 90 minute gradient with data-dependent acquisition (OT/IT) and HCD fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Files were searched with MS Fragger v3.4 with 10 ppm precursor tolerance/0.2 Da fragment ion tolerance.  Variable modification was methionine oxidation; fixed modification was cysteine alkylation. MS1 match-between-runs was employed. Database was created from Scleractinia [6125] on NCBI on 10Sep2021.
