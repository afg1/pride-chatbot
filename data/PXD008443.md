### Title
Serum proteomics in early onset breast cancer

### Description
Shotgun serum proteomics study to identify novel markers of prognosis in early onset breast cancer

### Sample Protocol
Samples were mixed with 6M guanidine hydrochliride and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. Four segments were collected. These were reconstituted in 0.5M TEAB 0.05% SDS and subjected to tip sonication, quantification, reduction, alkylation, trypsin proteolysis. Peptides were iTRAQ labelled, pooled and subjected to C8 offline and C18 online chromatography hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were submited to PD 1.4 for target decoy search
