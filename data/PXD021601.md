### Title
Regulatory function of sympathetic innervation on the endo/lysosomal trafficking of acetylcholine receptor

### Description
Regulation of membrane receptors involves management of endocytosis. At the neuromuscular junction, the synapse between skeletal muscle and motoneuron, proper density of the major receptor, the acetylcholine receptor, is of utmost importance for sustaining life in context of mobility. Recent work has revealed innervation of NMJs by sympathetic neurons and destruction of them had morphological and functional consequences, suggesting influence on endocytosis.  To investigate the pathways and proteins that are relevant for acetylcholine receptor turnover and affected by sympathetic signaling, proteomes of mouse hindlimb muscles from sympathectomized and saline-treated control muscles were compared. Using proteomic, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis in chemically sympathectomized mouse hindlimb muscles, the cause of these consequences were aimed to analyzed. This revealed extensive regulation of the proteome by the sympathetic nervous system and a possible regulatory function of the endo/lysosomal and autophagic pathway by sympathetic neuronal input. This finding might provide a new explanation to the observed benefit of sympathicomimetic treatment in several congenital myasthenic syndromes.

### Sample Protocol
Tibialis anterior muscles (right and left) derived from four different mice treated either with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHD) were used for proteomics analysis. The tissue sections were first snap frozen using liquid nitrogen followed by manual grinding with a metal dounce. Samples were then lysed with 1% SDS buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8 with complete mini. To degrade nucleic acids, tissue lysates were treated with Benzonase and 2 mM MgCl2 and incubation at 37°C for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 rcf at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and used to determine protein concentration with BCA assay as per manufacturer’s instructions. Samples corresponding to ~150 µg of protein of each sample were subjected to carbamidomethylation i.e. reduction of disulfide bonds with 10 mM DTT and incubation at 56°C for 30 min followed by alkylation of free thiol groups with 30 mM IAA and incubation at RT for 30 min in the dark. Next, sample cleaning and on-filter proteolytic digestion (trypsin) were performed using the filter aided sample preparation [1, 2] protocol with nanosep centrifugal devices (30 KDa, PALL), but with minor changes as previously described [3]. Tryptic peptides were quality controlled [4] and were desalted with C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (SPEC; 4 mg, Varian) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the eluted peptides were dried in a SpeedVac and stored at -80°C until further use.  iTRAQ labeling and high pH (8.0) C18 reversed-phase fractionation The dried peptides were resolubilized in 30 µL of 0.5 M TEAB, pH 8.5 and samples were labeled with iTRAQ reagents [5] according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After labeling and incubation at RT for 2 h, 1 µL of each sample was pooled and analyzed by LC-MS to evaluate labeling efficiency and to correct minor differences of sample amounts e.g. due to pipetting errors. Afterwards, samples were mixed in 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio based on the normalization factors obtained from the prior LC-MS analysis. An aliquot corresponding to ~20 µg of the multiplexed sample was desalted with C18 SPEC tips (4 mg, Varian). Eluted peptides were dried in a SpeedVac and resolubilized in 10 mM NH4OH, 17 mM FA, pH 8.0 (Buffer A) and fractionated on a C18 reversed-phase column at pH 8.0 as described earlier [3]. In total 16 fractions were collected at 1 min intervals from min 5 to 70 in a concatenation mode. The fractions were completely dried in a SpeedVac and stored at -80°C until further use.

### Data Protocol
All iTRAQ data (16 raw files) were processed simultaneously using the MudPIT option with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Germany) and searched in a target/decoy approach against the mouse Uniprot database with 16802 target entries, downloaded in July 2016 using three different search algorithms i.e. Mascot (Matrix Science), Sequest and MS Amanda using same set of parameters as following. Mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da for MS and MS/MS, respectively. Trypsin was selected as enzyme with a maximum of two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation of Cys (57.0214 Da) and iTRAQ-8-plex on N terminus and Lys (304.2053 Da) were set as fixed modifications whereas, oxidation of Met (15.9949 Da) as variable modifications. The vendor provided isotope purity correction factors were incorporated in the Reporter ion node. Percolator node was included to estimate the false discovery rate. Data export was done using following filter criteria: peptide-spectrum matches with FDR ≤ 1% (high confidence setting), search engine rank 1 and only proteins that were quantified with ≥ 2 unique peptides were considered for further data analysis. Next, the normalization of the raw iTRAQ ratios was done using Excel (Microsoft) as described before [3] to get normalized abundance values (NAVs) for each protein. The NAVs of the corresponding channels were averaged accordingly and the ratios were calculated between 6OHD/PBS for each protein. Lastly, the global standard deviation (gSD) and the global mean (gM) were determined over all protein log2-ratios and Student's t-Test p-values (two-sample assuming unequal variance) were calculated for each protein. Only proteins with p-values ≤ 0.05 and with log2-ratios ≥ 2 gSD away from the gM were considered as regulated.
