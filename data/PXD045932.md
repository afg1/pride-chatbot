### Title
Phosphoproteomics of yeast strains undergoing nitrogen or phosphate starvation

### Description
In the project «Phosphoproteomics of yeast strains undergoing nitrogen or phosphate starvation» phosphoproteomics and expression proteomics were performed. In biological triplicates label-free quantification of different S. cerevisiae strains was performed. Five strains were used:(a) Ctrl WT, (b) WT, (c) deltaAtg13, (d) deltaPho81, (e) deltaAtg13, deltaPho81 (DKO)

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted by disrupting yeast cells in 8 M urea using a bead beater, and digested by Lys-C for 4 h at room temperature. Before overnight trypsin digestion, the concentration of urea was diluted to 1 M. Next day, peptides were purified by SPE using HR-X columns. Dry peptides were suspended in 200 μl 80% acetonitrile with 1% TFA for phosphopeptide enrichment using Fe(III)-NTA cartridges on an AssayMAP Bravo (Agilent). The flow-through was stored at −80°C for non-phosphopeptide analysis.

### Data Protocol
For DIA-based phosphopeptide analyses, MS raw files were analyzed using Spectronaut software (version 17) using default setting and a spectral library of phosphopeptides generated by DDA. For DDA-based peptide analyses, MS raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 2.0.1.0) (PMID: 19029910) using a UniProt full-length S. cerevisiae database (March, 2016) and common contaminants, such as keratins and enzymes used for in-gel digestion, as reference.
