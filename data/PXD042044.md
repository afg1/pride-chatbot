### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis of gastric cancer cells treated by bifidobacterium infantis-mediated herpes simplex virus-TK/ganciclovir.

### Description
MKN-45 cells were treated with PBS, BF-TK, BF/GCV or BF-TK/GCV for 48 h (GCV, 167 µg/ml), respectively. BF-TK (n = 3), BF/GCV (n = 3) or BF-TK/GCV (n = 3) groups were analyzed in triplicate.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were suspended in lysis buffer [1.0% sodium deoxycholate (SDS), 8 M urea] with appropriate protease inhibitors to inhibit protease activity. The mixture was allowed to settle at 4°C for 30 min and vortexed at every 5 min, and treated by ultrasound at 40 kHz and 40 W for 2 min. After centrifugation at 16000 g at 4°C for 30 min, the concentration of protein supernatant was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo, USA). Protein quantification was performed according to the kit protocol.   Protein digestion was performed according to the standard procedure and the resulting peptide mixture was labeled using the 10-plex TMT reagent (Thermo fisher, Art.No.90111) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the pooled samples were fractionated into fractions by ACQUITY Ultra Performance liquid chromatography (Waters, USA) with ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column (1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm, Waters, USA) to increase proteomic depth. At last，labeled peptides were analyzed by online nano flow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry performed on a 9RKFSG2_NCS-3500R system (Thermo, USA) connected to a QExactive Plus quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo, USA) through a nanoelectrospray ion source.

### Data Protocol
The RAW data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, version 2.2) Against uniprot-proteome_UP000005640-Homo sapiens (Human) [9606]-74468s-20190823.fasta database. The MS/MS search criteria were as follows: Mass tolerance of 10 ppm for MS and 0.02 Da for MS/MS tolerance, trypsin as the enzyme with 2 missed cleavage allowed, carbamido methylation of cysteine and the TMT of N- terminus and lysine side chains of peptides as fixed modification, and methionine oxidation as dynamic modifications, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identification was set as FDR ≤ 0.01. A minimum of one unique peptide identification was used to support protein identification.

### Publication Abstract
Previous studies have found that <i>Bifidobacterium infantis</i>-mediated herpes simplex virus-TK/ganciclovir (BF-TK/GCV) reduces the expression of VEGF and CD146, implying tumor metastasis inhibition. However, the mechanism by which BF-TK/GCV inhibits tumor metastasis is not fully studied. Here, we comprehensively identified and quantified protein expression profiling for the first time in gastric cancer (GC) cells MKN-45 upon BF-TK/GCV treatment using quantitative proteomics. A total of 159 and 72 differential expression proteins (DEPs) were significantly changed in the BF-TK/GCV/BF-TK and BF-TK/GCV/BF/GCV comparative analysis. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis enriched some metastasis-related pathways such as gap junction and cell adhesion molecules pathways. Moreover, the transwell assay proved that BF-TK/GCV inhibited the invasion and migration of tumor cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated that BF-TK/GCV reduced the expression of HIF-1&#x3b1;, mTOR, NF-&#x3ba;B1-p105, VCAM1, MMP13, CXCL12, ATG16, and CEBPB, which were associated with tumor metastasis. In summary, BF-TK/GCV inhibited tumor metastasis, which deepened and expanded the understanding of the antitumor mechanism of BF-TK/GCV.
