### Title
SWATH-MS proteomic analysis of primary human keratinocytes exposed to Cannabidiol

### Description
Primary human keratinocytes cultures were incubated with either DMSO or cannabidiol (10 uM) for 24 hours (N=4) to evaluate the effect of this compound over skin cells.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts from cell cultures, with or without Cannabidiol treatment, were subjected to trypsin digestion. RePLiCal iRT (PolyQuant GmbH) peptides were added to the peptide samples in order to calibrate retention times in the SWATH runs. Samples (1 ug) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS usign a data-independent SWATH acquisition using a Triple TOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (Sciex) coupled to a nLC system with a 2 h gradient (5% to 30% ACN 0.1% formic acid, 300 nL/min, column: Thermo PepMap100 25 cm x 75 um id). For building the spectral library, shotgun data-dependent acquisition runs (top 65 method) were performed on the same LC-MS equipment and gradient.

### Data Protocol
Proteins and peptides were identified from the DDA shotgun runs using ProteinPilot v5.0 and a concatenated target-reverse decoy SwissProt human protein database. A spectral library was built using the MS/MS ALL with SWATH Acquisition MicroApp (v2.0) using the peptides that showed up in the database search with a confidence score above 99%. The library-assisted targeted data extraction of the fragment ion chromatogram traces from the SWATH runs, and the retention time calibration, was performed by PeakView (version 2.1) using the MS/MSALL with SWATH Acquisition MicroApp (version 2.0), using a 1% FDR threshold and 50 ppm of tolerance. MarkerView (version 1.2.1, Sciex) was used for signal normalisation.

### Publication Abstract
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid that attracted a great attention for its therapeutic potential against different pathologies including skin diseases. However, although the efficacy in preclinical models and the clinical benefits of CBD in humans have been extensively demonstrated, the molecular mechanism(s) and targets responsible for these effects are as yet unknown. Herein we characterized at the molecular level the effects of CBD on primary human keratinocytes using a combination of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS). Functional analysis revealed that CBD regulated pathways involved in keratinocyte differentiation, skin development and epidermal cell differentiation among other processes. In addition, CBD induced the expression of several NRF2 target genes, with heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) being the gene and the protein most upregulated by CBD. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, RNA interference and biochemical studies demonstrated that the induction of HMOX1 mediated by CBD, involved nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of the transcriptional repressor BACH1. Notably, we showed that the effect of BACH1 on HMOX1 expression in keratinocytes is independent of NRF2. In vivo studies showed that topical CBD increased the levels of HMOX1 and of the proliferation and wound-repair associated keratins 16 and 17 in the skin of mice. Altogether, our study identifies BACH1 as a molecular target for CBD in keratinocytes and sets the basis for the use of topical CBD for the treatment of different skin diseases including atopic dermatitis and keratin disorders.
