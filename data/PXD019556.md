### Title
iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of heat stress-induced mechanisms in pepper seedlings

### Description
iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of heat stress-induced mechanisms in pepper seedlings

### Sample Protocol
The proteome in the leaves of two pepper genotypes with contrasting heat tolerance were investigated under heat stress using an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach. Protein extracts from pepper leave samples were obtained using the Plant Protein Extraction Kit (Beijing Bio-Fly BiotechCo.,Ltd., China) per the manufacturer’s recommendation. The total protein contents of the samples were detected by SDS-PAGE. Protein digestion was performed based on the filter-aided sample preparation procedure (FASP).  After trypsin digestion, peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation, reconstituted in iTRAQ dissolution buffer, and labeled using iTRAQ 8-plex kits (AB Sciex Inc., MA, USA) per the manufacturer’s recommendation.

### Data Protocol
The raw file was processed using the Mascot engine embedded into the Proteome Discoverer 2.1 against the pepper protein database (Zunla-1 version 2).
