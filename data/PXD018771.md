### Title
Proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry of human K562 cells

### Description
Proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry was performed on human K562 cell lysates. MS2-MS3 fragmentation strategy was used to aquire the XL-MS data. The raw files in this dataset are a subset of PXD013928.

### Sample Protocol
SCX and HILIC approaches were utilized to enrich for the cross-linked peptides.

### Data Protocol
PSM searches were performed using Sequest node in Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software for cross-link search using MaXLinker software

### Publication Abstract
Thorough quality assessment of novel interactions identified by proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) studies is critical. Almost all current XL-MS studies have validated cross-links against known three-dimensional structures of representative protein complexes. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating that this approach can drastically underestimate error rates for proteome-wide XL-MS datasets, and propose a comprehensive set of four data-quality metrics to address this issue.
