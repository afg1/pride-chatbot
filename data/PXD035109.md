### Title
The Holdup Multiplex, an assay for high-throughput measurement of protein-ligand affinity constants using a mass-spectrometry readout

### Description
We developed the Holdup Multiplex, which quantifies hundreds of protein-peptide affinities at unprecedented accuracy with only one single experiment, using a label-free quantitative mass-spectrometry strategy. We applied this strategy to the seven human 14 3 3 proteins, and depicted new rules for 14 3 3 binding and specificity, valid at the proteome scale. Our approach is readily transferable to affinity-quantify the interactome of any protein of interest for any pool of ligands. 

### Sample Protocol
Synthetic phosphorylated peptides were retained at equilibrium on 14-3-3 saturated resins depending on their affinities. For each peptide its relative amount in the flow-through was quantified by nanoLC-MS/MS in a DIA mode and compared to a control condition.

### Data Protocol
The data were processed with Spectronaut with a home-made library
