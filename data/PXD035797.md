### Title
Dandelion extract inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell proliferation by interfering with glycerophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids metabolism

### Description
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. TNBC exists widely reprogrammed lipid metabolism, and its metabolic-associated proteins and oncometabolites are promising as potential therapeutic targets. Dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum) is a classical herbal medicine used to treat breast diseases based on traditional Chinese medicine theory and was reported to have antitumor effects and lipid regulatory capacities. Our previous study showed that dandelion extract was effective against TNBC. However, whether dandelion extract could regulate the lipid metabolisms of TNBC and exert its antitumor effects via interfering with lipids metabolism remained unclear. In this study, an integrated approach combined with network pharmacology and multi-omics techniques (including proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) was performed to investigate the potential regulatory mechanisms of dandelion extract against TNBC. We first determined the antitumor effects of dandelion extract in vitro and in vivo. Then, network pharmacology analysis speculated the antitumor effects involving various metabolic processes, and the multi-omics results of the cells, tumor tissues, and plasma revealed the changes in the metabolites and metabolic-associated proteins after dandelion extract treatment. The alteration of glycerophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids were the most remarkable types of metabolites. Therefore, the metabolism of glycerophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids, and their corresponding proteins CHKA and FADS2, were considered the primary regulatory pathways and biomarkers of dandelion extract against TNBC. Subsequently, experimental validation showed that dandelion extract decreased CHKA expression, leading to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and its downstream targets, SREBP and FADS2. Finally, the molecular docking simulation suggested that picrasinoside F and luteolin in dandelion extract had the most highly binding scores with CHKA, indicating they may be the potential CHKA inhibitors to regulate glycerophospholipids metabolisms of TNBC. In conclusion, we confirmed the antitumor effects of dandelion extract against TNBC cells in vitro and demonstrated that dandelion extract could interfere with glycerophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids metabolism via downregulating the CHKA expression and thus inhibiting PI3K/AKT/SREBP/FADS2 axis.

### Sample Protocol
1) Total protein extract and trypsin digestion. All cell samples were resuspended in the lysis buffer (8M urea, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail) and sonicated at 4°C three times. Subsequently, centrifugation was conducted to remove the remaining debris at 12000 g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected to measure the protein concentration by BCA kit (Scientz, China). Equal amounts of protein samples were taken, and the appropriate amount of standard protein was added for trypsin digestion. Then lysis buffer was added to ensure the volume of each sample was consistent. Afterward, the protein solution was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15min at room temperature in darkness. Then, the urea concentration of protein solution was diluted to less than 2 M by adding 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Then, trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 (trypsin: protein) for the first digestion overnight and 1:100 (trypsin: protein) for a second 4 h digestion.  2) TMT labeling and HPLC fractionation. The peptides were desalted by Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex, USA) and dried in a vacuum. Then the peptides were reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB and processed with the TMT labeling kit (Scientz, China). The cell samples treated with dandelion extract were labeled with 126, 127, 128 tags, and samples of vehicle treatment were labeled with 129, 130, 131 tags. The peptide mixtures were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature and pooled, desalted, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The tryptic peptides were fractionated into 60 fractions with an 8%-32% acetonitrile gradient (pH 9.0) for 60min by high pH reverse-phase HPLC with a C18 column (Thermo Betasil, 5 μm particles, 10 mm inner diameter, and 250 mm length). Then, the eluted peptides were combined into 6 fractions and dried by vacuum centrifuging.  3) LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A), and the mixtures were directly loaded onto a reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm length, 75 μm inner diameter). The chromatographic condition was set as an increase of 6%-23% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) over 26 min, 23%-15% in 8min, climbing to 80% in 3min, and then holding at 80% for the last 3 min with a constant flow rate of 400 nL/min in the EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific, USA). Afterward, the peptides were subjected to a nanospray ion (NSI) source followed by tandem mass spectrometry in Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled online to the UPLC. The electrospray voltage was 2.0 kV. The ion data of MSI ranging from 400 to 1500 Da was detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120000. The ion data of MS2 over 100Da was detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15000. The data collection was performed via a data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans with 15.0s dynamic exclusion.

### Data Protocol
4) Database search. The raw MS/MS data were processed by Maxquant software (version 1.5.2.8) and searched in the human UniProt database. Trypsin/P was specified as a cleavage enzyme allowing up to 4 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in the First search and 5 ppm in the Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. The fixed modification was carbamidomethyl, and variable modifications were oxidation and acetylation. False discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted to < 1%, and the minimum score for modified peptides was set > 40.
