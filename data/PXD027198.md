### Title
Personalised phosphoproteomics extracts functional signalling

### Description
Protein phosphorylation dynamically integrates environmental and cellular information to control virtually all biological processes.  Identifying functional phosphorylation amongst the thousands of phosphosites regulated by a perturbation at a global scale is a major challenge. Here, we introduce personalised phosphoproteomics, an experimental and computational framework to link signalling with biological function by exploiting human phenotypic variance. This is achieved by measuring individual subject phosphoproteome responses to interventions with corresponding phenotypes measured in parallel. We employed this method to investigate how exercise potentiates insulin sensitivity in human skeletal muscle. Our approach extracted signalling highly enriched in known functional sites, as well as many previously unknown sites on proteins intimately involved in glucose metabolism. This included a new co-operative relationship between mTOR and AMPK, for which we found a role in metabolic regulation. These results establish personalised phosphoproteomics as a general approach to investigate the signal transduction underlying complex biology.

### Publication Abstract
Protein phosphorylation dynamically integrates environmental and cellular information to control biological processes. Identifying functional phosphorylation amongst the thousands of phosphosites regulated by a perturbation at a global scale is a major challenge. Here we introduce 'personalized phosphoproteomics', a combination of experimental and computational analyses to link signaling with biological function by utilizing human phenotypic variance. We measure individual subject phosphoproteome responses to interventions with corresponding phenotypes measured in parallel. Applying this approach to investigate how exercise potentiates insulin signaling in human skeletal muscle, we identify both known and previously unidentified phosphosites on proteins involved in glucose metabolism. This includes a cooperative relationship between mTOR and AMPK whereby the former directly phosphorylates the latter on S377, for which we find a role in metabolic regulation. These results establish personalized phosphoproteomics as a general approach for investigating the signal transduction underlying complex biology.
