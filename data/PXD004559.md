### Title
Mapping and quantification of over 2,000 O-linked glycopeptides in activated human T cells with isotope-targeted glycoproteomics

### Description
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins often function to regulate signaling cascades, with the activation of T cells during an adaptive immune response being a classic example. Mounting evidence indicates that the modification of proteins by O-linked Nacetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), the only mammalian glycan found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, helps regulate T cell activation. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how O-GlcNAc functions in T cell activation remains elusive, partly because of the difficulties in mapping and quantifying O-GlcNAc sites. Thus, to advance insight into the role of O-GlcNAc in T cell activation, we performed extensive glycosite mapping studies via direct glycopeptide measurement on resting and activated primary human T cells with a technique termed isotope targeted glycoproteomics. This approach led to the identification of over 2,000 intact O-GlcNAccontaining glycopeptides across 1,046 glycoproteins. A significant proportion (>45%) of the identified O-GlcNAc sites lie in close proximity to or coincide with known phosphorylation sites, supporting the potential for PTM crosstalk. Consistent with other studies, we find that O-GlcNAc sites in T cells lack a strict consensus sequence. To validate our results, we employed gel shift assays based on conjugating mass tags to O-GlcNAc groups. Notably, we observed that the transcription factors c-JUN and JUNB show higher levels of O-GlcNAc glycosylation and higher levels of expression in activated T cells. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative characterization of O-GlcNAc glycoproteins and their corresponding modification sites in primary human T cells, which will facilitate mechanistic studies into the function of O-GlcNAc in T cell activation.

### Sample Protocol
Human T cells isolated from healthy blood bank donors were cultured with peracetylated Nazidoacetyl galactosamine (Ac4GalNAz, 40 μM) for 50 h to metabolically label O-GlcNAc. Ac4GalNAz is converted intracellularly to UDP-GlcNAz via the UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GALE) pathway to yield O-GlcNAzylated proteins (35). Labeled T cells from each biological replicate were then divided into three aliquots and cultured for an additional 18 h in one of three conditions (Figure 1A). One aliquot was incubated with control beads while the other two were incubated with either anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads or PMA/ionomycin to induce polyclonal T cell activation. Cells were collected and lysed.  Azide-labeled cell lysates were then tagged with a cleavable and isotopically encoded biotin probe via click chemistry, affinity enriched, and digested on-bead with trypsin or chymotrypsin to release nonconjugated (i.e., non-glycosylated) peptides from the captured O-GlcNAz glycoproteins. Glycopeptides were recovered via cleavage of the biotin probe (2% formic acid) and analyzed on a Thermo LTQ–Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched against the humanspecific SwissProt-reviewed database downloaded on July 18, 2014. Indexed databases for tryptic digests were created allowing for up to three missed cleavages, one fixed modification (carboxyamidomethylcysteine, +57.021 Da), and variable modifications (methionine oxidation, +15.995 Da; and others as described below). Precursor ion mass tolerances for spectra acquired using the Orbitrap were set to 10 ppm. The fragment ion mass tolerance for spectra acquired using the Orbitrap and ion trap were set to 20 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. The SEQUEST HT search engine as used to identify tryptic and chymotryptic peptides from whole protein and nonconjugated peptides. The Byonic search algorithm v2.0 was used as a node in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for glycopeptide searches. Searches allowed for tagged O-glycan variable modifications (see input file below). A modified HexNAc, termed “Si2HexNAz” (C13H18D2N4O7, +346.1458 Da) or “Si0HexNAz” (C13H20N4O7, +344.1332 Da), with variable attachment to serine or threonine residues was used as a variable modification. Glycan custom modification list for Byonic v2.0: HexNAz2Si(1) @ OGlycan | common2 HexNAc(1) @ OGlycan | common2 HexNAz0Si(1) @ OGlycan | common2 HexNAz(1) @ OGlycan | common2

### Publication Abstract
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins often function to regulate signaling cascades, with the activation of T cells during an adaptive immune response being a classic example. Mounting evidence indicates that the modification of proteins by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), the only mammalian glycan found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, helps regulate T cell activation. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how O-GlcNAc functions in T cell activation remains elusive, partly because of the difficulties in mapping and quantifying O-GlcNAc sites. Thus, to advance insight into the role of O-GlcNAc in T cell activation, we performed glycosite mapping studies via direct glycopeptide measurement on resting and activated primary human T cells with a technique termed Isotope Targeted Glycoproteomics. This approach led to the identification of 2219 intact O-linked glycopeptides across 1045 glycoproteins. A significant proportion (&gt;45%) of the identified O-GlcNAc sites lie near or coincide with a known phosphorylation site, supporting the potential for PTM crosstalk. Consistent with other studies, we find that O-GlcNAc sites in T cells lack a strict consensus sequence. To validate our results, we employed gel shift assays based on conjugating mass tags to O-GlcNAc groups. Notably, we observed that the transcription factors c-JUN and JUNB show higher levels of O-GlcNAc glycosylation and higher levels of expression in activated T cells. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative characterization of O-GlcNAc glycoproteins and their corresponding modification sites in primary human T cells, which will facilitate mechanistic studies into the function of O-GlcNAc in T cell activation.
