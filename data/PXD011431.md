### Title
Insulin Induces Microtubule Stabilization and Regulates the Microtubule Plus-End Tracking Protein Network in Adipocytes

### Description
Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is known to involve microtubules, although the function of microtubules and the microtubule-regulating proteins involved in insulin action are poorly understood. CLASP2, a plus-end tracking microtubule-associated protein (+TIP) that controls microtubule dynamics, was recently implicated as the first +TIP associated with insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Here, using protein-specific targeted quantitative phosphoproteomics within 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we discovered that insulin regulates phosphorylation of the CLASP2 network members G2L1, MARK2, CLIP2, AGAP3 and CKAP5 as well as EB1, revealing the existence of a previously unknown microtubule-associated protein system that responds to insulin. To further investigate, G2L1 interactome studies within 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that G2L1 co-immunoprecipitates CLASP2 and CLIP2 as well as the master integrators of +TIP assembly, the end binding (EB) proteins. Live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in adipocytes revealed G2L1 and CLASP2 colocalize on microtubule plus-ends. We found that while insulin increases the number of CLASP2-containing plus-ends, insulin treatment simultaneously decreases CLASP2-containing plus-end velocity. In addition, we discovered that insulin stimulates re-distribution of CLASP2 and G2L1 from exclusive plus-end tracking to “trailing” behind the growing tip of the microtubule. Insulin treatment increases -tubulin Lysine 40 acetylation, a mechanism that was observed to be regulated by a counterbalance between GSK3 and mTOR, and also led to microtubule stabilization. Our studies introduce insulin-stimulated microtubule stabilization and plus-end trailing of +TIPs as new modes of insulin action and reveal the likelihood that a network of microtubule-associated proteins synergize to coordinate insulin-regulated microtubule dynamics.

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitations and preparation for SDS-PAGE were performed exactly as previously described (PMID:28550165). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 Stain. For the interactome experiments, each lane of the SDS-PAGE gel was cut into seven slices. For the specific protein targeted phosphoproteomics experiments, the single band corresponding to the location of the individual protein on the SDS-PAGE gel was excised. The gel slices were subjected to trypsin digestion and the resulting peptides were purified by C18-based desalting exactly as previously described (PMID:28550165). The dried peptides were resuspended in 6 ul of 0.1% FA (v/v) followed by sonication for 2 min. 2.5 ul of the final sample was then analyzed by mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
The fragment mass spectra were then searched against the mouse SwissProt_2016_10 database (23,550 entries) using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4) using the default probability cut-off score. The search variables that were used were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.5 Da for product ion masses; digestion with trypsin; a maximum of two missed tryptic cleavages; variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Cross-correlation of Mascot search results with X! Tandem was accomplished with Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.8.7; Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA). Probability assessment of peptide assignments and protein identifications were made through the use of Scaffold. Only peptides with ≥ 95% probability were considered. Reported peptide FDR rates from Scaffold ranged from 0.1-0.2%. Progenesis QI for proteomics software (version 2.4, Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) was used to perform ion-intensity based label-free quantification. In brief, in an automated format, .raw files were imported and converted into two-dimensional maps (y-axis = time, x-axis =m/z) followed by selection of a reference run for alignment purposes. An aggregate data set containing all peak information from all samples was created from the aligned runs, which was then further narrowed down by selecting only +2, +3, and +4 charged ions for further analysis. The samples were then grouped in basal versus insulin. A peak list of fragment ion spectra from only the top eight most intense precursors of a feature was exported in Mascot generic file (.mgf) format and searched against the mouse SwissProt_2016_10 (23,550 entries) database using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4). The search variables that were used were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.5 Da for product ion masses; digestion with trypsin; a maximum of two missed tryptic cleavages; variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine; 13C=1. The resulting Mascot .xml file was then imported into Progenesis, allowing for peptide/protein assignment, while peptides with a Mascot Ion Score of <25 were not considered for further analysis. Precursor ion-abundance values for specific phosphopeptide ions were normalized to a selected series of standard peptide ions for the same target protein. The selected series of standard peptide ions had to conform to a set of rules previously established i.e. (1) detected by HPLC-ESI-MS with high intensity among the peptides for the target protein; (2) no missed cleavage observed; (3) no methionine in the sequence to avoid variability due to methionine oxidization and no N-terminal Gln residues; (4) cannot be a non-phosphorylated version of a peptide that was detected as being phosphorylated. Each phosphopeptide ion’s normalized abundance value was normalized by the mean value of the respective basal sample and then expressed as a fold change over basal ±SEM. When multiple peptide ions were present for a particular phosphopeptide ion, a representative peptide ion was chosen to reflect the effect of insulin. For the proof of principle dose curve test, no normalization was performed.
