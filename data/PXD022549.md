### Title
Multiparametric characterization of red blood cells physiology after hypotonic dialysis based drug encapsulation process.

### Description
Red blood cells (RBC) can act as carriers for therapeutic agents and given their biocompatibility and long lifespan in the circulation, they can substantially improve the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of many drugs. Maintaining RBC integrity and lifespan is important for the efficacy of RBC as drug carrier and can be a complex challenge of drug encapsulation. We investigated the impact of drug encapsulation by hypotonic dialysis on RBC physiology and integrity. Several parameters were compared between processed RBC loaded with L-asparaginase (Ã¢â‚¬Å“eryaspaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), processed RBC without drug and non-processed RBC. Processed RBC were less hydrated and displayed a reduction of intracellular content, relative to non-processed RBC. This reduction of intracellular content changed the RBC metabolomic profile, as indicated by the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, but no impact on the global RBC proteomic profile was observed. We found that the encapsulation process caused moderate morphological changes and was accompanied by an increase of microparticles. Despite a decrease in their deformability, processed RBC were not mechanically retained in a spleen-mimicking device. Moreover, processed RBC had increased surface-to-volume ratio and osmotic resistance. Finally, the half-life of processed RBC was not significantly affected in a mouse model and our previous phase 1 clinical study showed that encapsulation of asparaginase in RBC prolonged its in vivo half-life compared to free form. Overall, our study demonstrated that encapsulation by hypotonic dialysis may affect certainÃ‚Â  several characteristics of RBC, but does not significantly impact on the in vivo longevity of RBC or their drug carrier function.

### Sample Protocol
Prior to proteomic analysis, the purity of RBC samples was controlled by assessing reticulocyte, leukocyte and platelet content. Leukocytes and platelets levels were measured using a hematological analyzer (Excell 2280, Drew Scientific, Florida, USA), and reticulocytes were quantified by flow-cytometry (MACSQuant Analyzer 10, Miltenyi, USA) after Retic-count reagent staining (BD Bioscience, San Jose, USA). Low levels of platelets, leukocytes (under detection threshold; i.e., <5 and 1.103/Ã‚ÂµL, respectively) and reticulocytes (< 0.6%) were observed.  RBC samples were then centrifuged at 200g for 15 min at 4Ã‚Â°C. Supernatant was discarded and RBC were washed twice in PBS 1X. 5Ã‚ÂµL of RBC pellet was frozen at -80Ã‚Â°C for total RBC analysis. The remaining part (500Ã‚ÂµL) was resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mM Na2HPO4, 0.3 mM EDTA, pH 8; two volume of lysis buffer for one volume of RBC) and incubated for 20 min at 4Ã‚Â°C. RBC membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 21,500g for 15min and at 4Ã‚Â°C. Supernatant was discarded and sequential washes of ghost pellet were performed in lysis buffer until a white pellet (ghost RBC) was obtained. Ghosts were frozen at -80Ã‚Â°C pending analysis. Total and ghost RBC were digested by filter-assisted sample preparation (FASP) using trypsin. Resulting peptides were fractionated on strong cation exchange chromatographyÃ‚Â (SCX) StageTips in five different fractions. Peptides from each of these five fractions were separated by C18 rapid separation liquid chromatography (RSLC) Dionex U3000 on a 2 Âµm particle size, 100 Angstrum pore size, 75 Ã‚Âµm internal diameter, 25 cm length C18 reverse phase analytical column with a 3h binary gradient from 99% solution A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) to 55% solution B (80% ACN, 0.085% formic acid) before injection into an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (from Thermo Scientific). The Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer acquired data throughout the elution process and operated in a data-dependent scheme (top speed mode in 3 seconds) with full MS scans acquired with the orbitrap detector, followed by HCD fragmentation and Ion trap fragment detection of the most abundant ions detected in the MS scan. Mass spectrometer settings for full scan MS were: 1.0E6 AGC, 60,000 target resolution, 350-1500 m/z range, maximum injection time of 60 ms. HCD MS/MS fragmentation was permitted for 2-7+ precursor ions reaching more than 5.0E3 minimum intensity. Quadrupole-filtered precursors within 1.6 m/z isolation window were fragmented with a 30 Normalised Collision Energy setting. 1.0E5 AGC Target and 60 ms maximum injection time were the limiting ions accumulation values. The Ion-trap detector was used for its fast and sensitive detection capabilities. A 30 seconds dynamic exclusion time was set.

### Data Protocol
Maxquant software version 1.6.2.6 was used for the analysis of raw data from mass spectrometer. Perseus version 1.6.1.1 and Excel softwares were used for data formatting and statistical analysis. Absolute protein quantification was performed as previously described1. Briefly, MCH was used as internal standard for protein quantification in total RBC samples. Quantification of ANK1 protein was performed in total RBC samples and further used as a reference for quantification of proteins in corresponding ghost samples.
