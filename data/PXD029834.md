### Title
Proteomic analysis of primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) stimulated for 24â€‰h with either 50 ï�­g/mL recombinant Fibrillin-1 C-terminal fragment or 25â€‰ng/ml VEGF-A compared to unstimulated cells.

### Description
Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene result in cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities in Marfan syndrome. Here we show that a fibrillin-1 mutation also alters the neovessel formation. In the mouse retina vascularization model, fibrillin-1 is detected at the basement membrane underlying the angiogenic front and around arterioles. In Fbn1C1041G/+ mice, a model of Marfan disease, the microvasculature is altered at these sites. At the front, endothelial tip-cell sprouting and branching are decreased, and we show that mutant fibrillin-1 delays angiogenesis by affecting Notch signalling. Supplying the growing vasculature of Fbn1C1041G/+ mice with a C-terminal fragment of fibrillin-1 corrects all defects. In vitro, the C-terminal fragment of fibrillin-1 also displays pro-angiogenic activities on microvascular endothelial cell. Our data establish that fibrillin-1 performs essential functions in microvessel formation and integrity and that mutant fibrillin-1-induced defects can be rescued pharmacologically.

### Sample Protocol
Three independent biological replicates on total protein extracts from human endothelial cells stimulated by angiogenic molecules such as VEGF or HrFbn1-C or unstimulated: control condition were performed. 10 Âµg of proteins were loaded on a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and proteins were visualized by Colloidal Blue staining. Migration was stopped when samples had just entered the resolving gel and the unresolved region of the gel was cut into only one segment. Each SDS-PAGE band was cut into 1 mm x 1 mm gel pieces. Gel pieces were destained in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), 50% Acetonitrile (ACN) and shrunk in ACN for 10 min. After ACN removal, gel pieces were dried at room temperature. Proteins were first reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 60 min at 56Â°C then alkylated in 100 mM iodoacetamide, 100 mM NH4HCO3 for 60 min at room temperature and shrunken in ACN for 10 min. After ACN removal, gel pieces were rehydrated with 50 mM NH4HCO3 for 10 min at room temperature. Before protein digestion, gel pieces were shrunken in ACN for 10 min and dried at room temperature. Proteins were digested by incubating each gel slice with 10 ng/Âµl of trypsin (V5111, Promega) in 40 mM NH4HCO3, rehydrated at 4Â°C for 10 min, and finally incubated overnight at 37Â°C. The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel by three steps: a first incubation in 40 mM NH4HCO3 for 15 min at room temperature and two incubations in 47.5% ACN, 5% formic acid for 15 min at room temperature. The three collected extractions were pooled with the initial digestion supernatant, dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended with 0.1% formic acid for a final concentration of 0.05 Âµg/ÂµL. NanoLC-MS/MS analysis were performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano-UPHLC system (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to a nanospray Orbitrap Fusionâ„¢ Lumosâ„¢ Tribridâ„¢ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, California, USA). Each peptide extracts were loaded on a 300 Âµm ID x 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a flow rate of 10 ÂµL/min. After a 3 min desalting step, peptides were separated on a 50 cm EasySpray column (75 Âµm ID, 2 Âµm C18 beads, 100 Ã… pore size, ES903, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 4-40% linear gradient of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN) in 115 min. The separation flow rate was set at 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode at a 2.0 kV needle voltage. Data was acquired using Xcalibur 4.1 software in a data-dependent mode. MS scans (m/z 375-1500) were recorded at a resolution of R = 120000 (@ m/z 200) and a standard AGC target, ions collected within 50 ms, followed by a top speed duty cycle of up to 3 seconds for MS/MS acquisition. Precursor ions (2 to 7 charge states) were isolated in the quadrupole with a mass window of 1.6 Th and fragmented with HCD@30% normalized collision energy. MS/MS data was acquired in the ion trap with rapid scan mode, a 20% normalized AGC target and a maximum injection time in dynamic mode. Selected precursors were excluded for 60 seconds.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and Label-Free Quantification (LFQ) were done in Proteome Discoverer 2.4. MS Amanda 2.0, Sequest HT and Mascot 2.5 algorithms were used for protein identification in batch mode by searching against a Uniprot Homo sapiens database (75 796 entries, release September 3, 2020). Two missed enzyme cleavages were allowed for the trypsin. Mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da. Oxidation (M) and acetylation (K) were searched as dynamic modifications and carbamidomethylation (C) as static modification. Peptide validation was performed using Percolator algorithm and only â€œhigh confidenceâ€� peptides were retained corresponding to a 1% false discovery rate at peptide level. Minora feature detector node (LFQ) was used along with the feature mapper and precursor ions quantifier. The normalization parameters were selected as follows : (1) Unique peptides (2) Precursor abundance based on intensity (3) Normalization mode : total peptide amount (4) Protein abundance calculation : summed abundances (5) Protein ratio calculation : pairwise ratio based and (6) Hypothesis test : t-test (background based). Quantitative data were considered for master proteins, quantified by a minimum of 2 unique peptides, a fold changes above 2 and a statistical p-value lower than 0.05.

### Publication Abstract
Fibrillin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein that assembles into microfibrils which provide critical functions in large blood vessels and other tissues. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene are associated with cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities in Marfan syndrome. Here, we reveal that fibrillin-1 is critical for angiogenesis which is compromised by a typical Marfan mutation. In the mouse retina vascularization model, fibrillin-1 is present in the extracellular matrix at the angiogenic front where it colocalizes with microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1, MAGP1. In <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, a model of Marfan syndrome, MAGP1 deposition is reduced, endothelial sprouting is decreased, and tip cell identity is impaired. Cell culture experiments confirmed that fibrillin-1 deficiency alters vascular endothelial growth factor-A/Notch and Smad signaling which regulate the acquisition of endothelial tip cell/stalk cell phenotypes, and we showed that modulation of MAGP1 expression impacts these pathways. Supplying the growing vasculature of <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice with a recombinant C-terminal fragment of fibrillin-1 corrects all defects. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that the fibrillin-1 fragment alters the expression of various proteins including ADAMTS1, a tip cell metalloprotease and matrix-modifying enzyme. Our data establish that fibrillin-1 is a dynamic signaling platform in the regulation of cell specification and matrix remodeling at the angiogenic front and that mutant fibrillin-1-induced defects can be rescued pharmacologically using a C-terminal fragment of the protein. These findings, identify fibrillin-1, MAGP1, and ADAMTS1 in the regulation of endothelial sprouting, and contribute to our understanding of how angiogenesis is regulated. This knowledge may have critical implications for people with Marfan syndrome.
