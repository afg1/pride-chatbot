### Title
Kinome profiling of primary CLL cells

### Description
Investigation of BCR signalling response of primary cells from a cohort of 40 CLL patients  using kinobbead idolation and MS profiling.  Cells were either stimulated using anti-IgM or isotype control.

### Sample Protocol
Lysates were loaded into kinobead columns to isolate kinases.  Elutions from these  experiments were processed by reduction, alkylation, concetration and were precipitated prior to trypsin digest.  Peptides were cleaned using ethyl acetate and C1-18 ahead of MS  analysis.

### Data Protocol
MaxQUANT software was used to identify kinases in each condtion for each patient.
