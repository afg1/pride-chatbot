### Title
Methylated trypsin -  Enhanced trypsin on a budget: Stabilization, purification and high-temperature application of inexpensive commercial trypsin for proteomics applications

### Description
HCP analysis of the various trypsins was performed using the X! Tandem search engine (Alanine) (http://www.thegpm.org). All data was searched against the downloaded UniProt Sus scrofa proteome (40.706 sequences, March 10, 2019) and the most recent cRAP list (http://www.thegpm.org). Data were search as: enzyme: semi-tryptic, parent ion error: 10 ppm, fragment error: 0.1 Da, max e-value: 0.01, fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation (C), partial  modifications: oxidation (M), methylation (K), dimethylation (K). Each triplicate set of result files were then analyzed through PeptideShaker 1.16.38 [26] and reported at 1% FDR.

### Sample Protocol
1 microgram trypsin preparations were autodigested at 55 degrees for 1 hour, prepared in triplicates. Samples were micropurified and run on LC-MS on Easy-LC / Q Exactive HF instruments.

### Publication Abstract
Trypsin is by far the most commonly used protease in proteomics. Even though the amount of protease used in each experiment is very small, digestion of large amounts of protein prior to enrichment can be rather costly. The price of commercial trypsin is highly dependent on the quality of the enzyme, which is determined by its purity, activity, and chemical modifications. In this study we evaluated several strategies for improving the quality of crude trypsin by reductive methylation and affinity purification. We present a protocol applicable to most proteomics laboratories for obtaining a highly stable and pure trypsin preparation using reductive methylation and purification by benzamidine-sepharose. The entire workflow can be performed within a day and yields ~4 mg per batch but is completely scalable. The methylated product was benchmarked against sequencing grade trypsin from Promega and they were found to be comparable for one hour digestions at elevated temperatures, where residual chymotryptic activity was found to be negligible.
