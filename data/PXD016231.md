### Title
Proteomics of saliva, plasma, and salivary gland tissue in Sjögren’s syndrome and non-Sjögren patients identify novel biomarker candidates

### Description
Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the proteome in whole saliva, plasma, and salivary gland tissue in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and patients having symptoms of pSS, but not fulfilling the classification criteria, and to search for diagnostic biomarker candidates for pSS. Methods: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was conducted on whole saliva, plasma, and labial salivary gland tissue samples from 24 patients with pSS and 16 non-Sjögren control subjects (non-pSS). Gene Ontology (GO)-terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-pathways were applied for functional annotation. Results: 1,013 proteins were identified in whole saliva, 219 in plasma, and 3,166 in salivary gland tissue. In saliva, 40 proteins differed significantly between the two groups. In pSS, proteins involved in immunoinflammatory processes were upregulated, whereas proteins related to salivary secretion were downregulated. The combination of neutrophil elastase, calreticulin, and tripartite motif-containing protein 29 yielded a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.97 (CI 0.93-1.00). Protein expression in plasma and salivary gland tissue did not differ between the patient groups. Conclusion: The salivary proteome of patients with pSS differed from that of non-pSS patients, indicating that saliva proteomics represents a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for pSS.

### Sample Protocol
All samples were lysed with 95°C lysis buffer (9M GndHCl, 10 mM CAA, 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8). A volume of 250 µl saliva were mixed with 250 µl lysis buffer. A volume of 100 µl platelet poor plasma were crash-precipitated with 150 µl ACN after addition of 50 µl 2 x inhibitor solution (cOmplete™ protease inhibitor tablets, Sigma‐Aldrich), followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 min after brief vortexing. Then 200 µl of the supernatant was pipetted into a new Eppendorf tube and evaporated to half volume (45°C ~1 hour), in addition to the remaining pellet fraction. A volume of 250 µl lysis buffer was added to both supernatant and pellet fraction. Salivary gland tissue were thawed on ice and heat inactivated with Denator stabilizing system using predefined auto-frozen tissue program. Samples were cut into smaller pieces with a scalpel, and transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and 200 µl 95°C lysis buffer (6 M GndHCl, 5 mM TCEP, 10 mM CAA in 50 mM Tris, pH 8) was added. After addition of lysis buffer, the samples were heated for 10 min (95°C) in thermo-shaker followed by 1 min of sonication with tip‐sonicator (Sonics, VibraCell) with an amplitude of 75% and 1 second on/off pulses, on ice. Saliva sample concentrations were between 0.83-5.35 µg/µl and diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with 50 mM Tris (pH 8) and digested with Lysyl Endoproteinase (LysC; Wako, Osaka, Japan) in a ratio of 1:100 w/w for 30 min, followed by Trypsin (<22222ed sequencing grade; Sigma) digestion for four hours in a 1:100 w/w ratio. Plasma pellet fraction concentrations were between 6.6-16.6 µg/µl and supernatant concentrations were between 0.9-1.7 µg/µl. Volumes of  µl, and 100 µl, respectively, were digested with a fixed amount of LysC (2 µg) for 3 hours after dilution with 100 µl of 25 mM Tris (pH 8). After initial digestion, Trypsin was added in the same amount (2 µg) and for overnight digestion (10 hours). Concentrations of salivary gland tissue were between 0.4-7.7 µg/µl and full volume were digested with LysC in protein/enzyme ratio of 100:1 for 3 hours after dilution with 800 µl of 25 mM Tris (pH 8). After initial digestion, Trypsin was added in the same amount for further digestion overnight (14 hours). All digestion procedures were made in thermo-shaker at 37°C. Digestion was quenched by adding 10% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of ~1% followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 5 min. The resulting soluble peptide mixture were cleaned up and concentrated on Waters Sep-Pak reverse-phase C18 50 mg cartridges and the tryptic peptide mixtures were eluted with 400 µl 40% ACN followed by 400 µl 60% ACN. The eluates were evaporated/concentrated in SpeedVac until approx. 400 µl. Peptide concentrations were determined by NanoDrop (Thermo, Wilmington, DE, USA) measurement. The concentrations of saliva samples were adjusted to 0.5 µg/µl, plasma samples to 0.25 µg/µl, and salivary gland tissue samples to 0.125 µg/µl using 5% ACN, 0.1% TFA.  Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis General setup  A Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) connected with an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Scientific) was used for all samples. Peptides were separated on an in-house packed 15 cm capillary column with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) using a constant flow rate of 250 nl/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40°C using an integrated column oven (PRSO-V1; Sonation GmbH, Biberach, Germany).  Each sample was analyzed by online nano-scale Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a step-gradient. The steps were as following: 5 min in 5% buffer B, then 5 min in 10% buffer B, followed by 70 min in 40% buffer B, then 10 min in 80% buffer B and a 2 min wash, returning to 5% in 5 min, and continuing for re-equilibration for 8 min. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B of 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B of 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid. The Q Exactive HF instrument (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was run in a data dependent acquisition mode using a top 12 Higher-Collisional Dissociation (HCD)-MS/MS method with the following setting: Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, S-lens RF level at 50, and heated capillary at 275°C. Full scan resolutions were set to 120,000 at m/z 200. The scan target was 3 × 106 with a maximum fill time of 20 ms. Full-scan MS mass range was set to 300-1,750 and dynamic exclusion to 20 s. Target value for MS/MS scans was set at 2 × 105 with a resolution of 30,000 and a maximum fill time of 60 ms. Isolation window width was 1.2. m/z and normalized collision energy was set at 28. About 1.0 µg of saliva, 0.5 µg of plasma, and 0.25 µg of salivary gland tissue samples were injected.

### Data Protocol
Raw-files from MS analysis were processed with MaxQuant version 1.5.0.38 (12) with default settings and match between runs. In brief, acetylation of protein N-terminal and oxidation of methionine was set as variable modifications and carbamidometylation of cysteine as fixed modification. Minimum peptide length was seven amino acids. Digestion mode was trypsin/P and match between runs was done in a 0.7 min retention time window. False discovery rate (FDR) was 1% on both peptide and protein level, and decoy database was generated in revert mode. The data was searched against the Uniprot human reference proteome database downloaded January 2019 (13). As quality control filter, proteins with less than two peptides were removed together with known contaminants and reverse hits. Protein intensities were quantile normalized using the Bioconductor R package LIMMA. Further statistical analysis was performed using Perseus software version 1.6.2.3 (14). Quantile normalized intensities were log2 transformed. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used for multiple dependent analyses. Heatmaps were generated with hierarchical clustering using Euclidian distances and average linkage, after subtracting the median across samples from individual samples. The adjusted p values from two-sided t test were used for the volcano plots with a 5% FDR and a S0 value at 1.0 (fold-change limit). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots based on saliva, plasma, or salivary gland tissue were conducted only with entries having values in all samples (no imputation). PCA plot based on comparative analysis of proteins that were present at least once in all three sample types was carried out using imputation with replacement of missing values by log2(0.00001) representing a low intensity.
