### Title
Catechol-O-methyl transferase suppresses cell invasion and interplays with MET signaling in estrogen dependent breast cancer

### Description
Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is involved in detoxification of catechol estrogens, playing cancer-protective role in cells producing or utilizing estrogen. Moreover, COMT suppressed migration potential of breast cancer cells. To delineate COMT role in metastasis of estrogen receptor dependent BC, we investigated the effect of COMT overexpression on invasion, transcriptome, proteome and interactome of MCF7 cells, a luminal A breast cancer model, stably transduced with lentiviral vector carrying COMT gene (MCF7-COMT). This PRIDE project includes quantitative analysis results for the total proteome LC-DIA-MS/MS experiment evaluating COMT overexpression in MCF7 breast cancer cell line, and results of pulldown analysis of COMT-interacting proteins in MCF7 cells.

### Sample Protocol
Total proteome and pulldown samples were trypsin digested using Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method (PMID: 21526778) and desalted as previously described (PMID: 19053527). Briefly, proteins were transferred to the Microcon filter device, cut-off 30 kDa (Millipore), reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, alkylated using iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), digested by trypsin (Promega) in the ratio 1:30, and peptides were desalted on MicroSpin columns C18 (Nest Group). Total proteome: dried peptides were solubilized using 50 µl of 2.5% formic acid (FA) in 50% ACN and 100 µl of pure ACN and concentrated using SpeedVac to 20 µl. Samples were diluted into LC-MS vials to get peptide concentration of 1 µg/µl with addition of 1 µl 0.01% of polyethylene glycol in water, 1 µl of stock iRT peptides standard (Biognosys), 2 µl of 5% FA and filled into 10 ul by MiliQ water (Merck). Two µg of peptides mixture was injected for each sample.  LC-MS/MS analyses were done using RSLCnano system online connected to Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tryptic digests were online concentrated and desalted using trapping column (100 μm × 30 mm) filled with 3.5-μm X-Bridge BEH 130 C18 sorbent (Waters). After washing of trapping column with 0.1% FA, the peptides were eluted onto analytical Acclaim Pepmap100 C18 column (3 µm particles, 75 μm × 500 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) by the following gradient program (mobile phase A: 0.1% FA in water; mobile phase B: 0.1% FA in 80% ACN; flow 300 nl/min): the gradient elution started at 5 % of mobile phase B and began to increase in the 5th min to 37 % during the 109 min, then reached to 80 % of mobile phase B in the next 6 min and remained at this state for the last 10 min. Equilibration of the trapping column and the analytical column was done prior to sample injection to sample loop. The analytical column outlet was directly connected to the Digital PicoView 550 (New Objective) ion source. ABIRD (Active Background Ion Reduction Device, ESI Source Solutions) was installed. MS data were acquired in a data-independent mode (DIA). Orbitrap analyzer and quadrupole mass filter were employed for survey scan detection (350 – 1650 m/z). The MS scan resolution was 120 000 (at 200 m/z) with a target value of 2×105 ions and maximum injection time of 100 ms. After the MS scan, defined m/z segments were isolated by quadrupole mass filter and HCD fragmentation was done with a target value of 5×105 ions. MS/MS spectra after HCD fragmentation (default charge state is 2 and 28% collision energy) were recorded in Orbitrap with a resolution of 30 000 (at 200 m/z) in scan range of 200 – 1800 m/z. The maximum injection time for MS/MS was 50 ms. Pulldown: peptides were dissolved in 25 µl of 0.05% TFA in 5% ACN and 95% water. Mixture of synthetic peptides as retention time standards (HRM Calibration Kit, Biognosys) was added to the samples. Separation of tryptic peptides was performed on an Eksigent Ekspert nanoLC 400 liquid chromatograph (SCIEX), which was connected online to a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (SCIEX). Pre-concentration and additional desalting of the samples were performed using a mobile phase consisting of 0.05% TFA in 5% ACN and 95% water on a cartridge capture column (300 μm id x 5 mm) filled with C18 PepMap100 sorbent on 5 μm particles (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were then separated by an ACN/water gradient with a flow rate of 300 nl/min on an in-house capillary analytical PicoFrit® nanospray column (75 μm x 250 mm, New Objective, USA) filled with the ProntoSIL 120-3-C18 AQ stationary phase with 3 μm particles (Bischoff). Mobile phase A comprised 0.1% (v/v) FA in water and the mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% (v / v) FA in ACN. The analytical gradient was set at 5% of mobile phase B and 95% of mobile phase A, and the ratio was increased to 40% B and 60% A during 120 minutes. The separated peptides were ionized using a nano-electrospray (nitrogen used as mist and drying gas, flow rate 12, emitter voltage 2.65 kV) using DIA mode in high sensitivity mode. The precursor range was set from 400 to 1200 Th and was divided into 67 precursor windows with a width of 12 Th and an overlap of 1 Th. The accumulation time per precursor window was 50.8 ms, the total cycle time was 3.5 s. The MS/MS spectra were scanned from 360 to 1360 Th.

### Data Protocol
DIA data were analyzed in Spectronaut software version 13.9 (Biognosys) in directDIA mode. UniProt/SwissProt database version 2019_07 downloaded on 2019-09-16 limited to human entries containing 20431 sequences was used for database search. Carbamidomethylation (C) was used as fixed modification, oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N-term) were used as variable modifications. q-value at both precursor and protein levels were set to 0.01. Global data normalization was performed, data based on q-value 0.5 percentile (identified in 3 of 6 total runs) were involved in the final dataset. Analysis of differential protein abundance was performed using t-test implemented in Spectronaut with false discovery rate correction. Default settings were used for other parameters.

### Publication Abstract
This study describes the synthesis of fluorine-doped bismuth vanadate (F<sub>0.1</sub>BiVO<sub>4</sub>) and its composite with graphene oxide (GO) to improve charge transport properties. Based on the structural and morphological analysis such as X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and RAMAN the composite of F<sub>0.1</sub>BiVO<sub>4</sub>/r-GO/Nafion was successfully prepared with no filth. It was used to selectively detect the environmental contaminant 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) on a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electron channeling ability of reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) with F<sub>0.1</sub>BiVO<sub>4</sub> yielded a great electrochemical response (ER) in cyclic voltammetry compared to pure GCE and other modified electrodes. The differential pulse voltammetry response of 4-CP was highly sensitive with the detection of limit (LOD) of 0.56 nM and a wide linear response of 0.77-45.0&#xa0;nM. Fluorine doping, in particular, was able to affect the crystal growth of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, which was the primary cause of the aforementioned improvement. On the other hand, r-GO acts as an electron bridge to improve charge transfer between electrolytes and F-BiVO<sub>4</sub> due to its high electron transport rate. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of F<sub>0.1</sub>BiVO<sub>4</sub>/r-GO/Nafion/GCE for the electrochemical detection of 4-CP.
