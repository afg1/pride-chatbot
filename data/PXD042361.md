### Title
Interactome of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes and of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in human HEK293 cells.

### Description
Investigation of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes interactome in human HEK293 cells.

### Sample Protocol
HEK293T cells were cultured and transfected with plasmids encoding for FLAG-tagged E1/E2s. Cells were lysed with NP40 cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen #FNN0021) with protease inhibitors, sonicated for 5 s with a Branson Digital Sonifier at 30% amplitude, centrifuged, and the protein content of the supernatant measured by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. 100 μg of total protein for all samples was added to a final volume of 200 μL of NP40 cell lysis buffer. A small aliquot (20 μL) was removed and prepared for blotting as input. The remaining protein sample was mixed with 50 μL of FLAG affinity resin (Fisher Scientific #15895833) and incubated in rotating microcentrifuge tubes at 4°C overnight. The mix was centrifuged at 2000 g for 2 minutes, and the supernatant carefully removed, leaving the affinity resin and co-immunoprecipitated proteins that were then washed 3 times with PBS and once with NP40 cell lysis buffer. The bait and co-immunoprecipitating proteins were then eluted with 20 μL of 5 μg/mL FLAG peptide (Sigma #F3290) in NP40 cell lysis buffer while rocking at room temperature. SDS blue loading buffer and DTT were added to the input and eluted protein supernatants and heated at 95°C for 5 min for SDS-PAGE.  Spectral counting for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Following the co-immunoprecipitation procedure above, the samples were run for a short distance on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins in the gel bands were reduced with DTT to break disulfide bonds and the Cys residues were alkylated by iodoacetamide. The gel bands were then washed, dried down in a speed vacuum, and rehydrated with a buffer containing trypsin for overnight proteolysis. The digested samples were acidified and the peptides were extracted multiple times. The extracts were pooled, dried down, and reconstituted in a small volume. The peptide samples were loaded onto a nanoscale capillary reverse phase C18 column by a HPLC system (Thermo EasynLC 1000), and eluted by a gradient for ∼90 min. The eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization, and detected by an inline mass spectrometer (Thermo Elite). The MS spectra were collected first and the 20 most abundant ions were sequentially isolated for MS/MS analysis. This process was cycled over the entire liquid chromatography gradient.

### Data Protocol
Database searches were performed with the Sequest search engine included in the in-house JUMP software package. All matched MS/MS spectra were filtered by mass accuracy and matching scores to reduce the protein false discovery rate to ∼1%. Finally, all proteins identified in one gel lane were combined together. The total number of spectra, i.e. spectral counts (SC), matching to individual proteins reflect their relative abundance in one sample after normalization for protein size. The spectral counts were used for the calculation of P values to identify significantly-enriched proteins. A Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) score was calculated to indicate the probability that the detected proteins are more abundant for that FLAG-tagged bait compared to a negative control in which a lysate from mock-transfected cells that do not express any FLAG-tagged protein underwent the same co-immunoprecipitation procedures.  A SAINT≥0.65 was classified as a significantly-enriched interactor compared to control samples. Cytoscape was utilized to represent protein-protein interaction data, which consisted of 1171 significantly-interacting pairs for 30 E2 baits. Based on the whole proteome mass spectrometry data from HEK293T cells, the average spectral counts for proteins detected by affinity purification was substantially higher than the average for all detected proteins. Therefore the identification of interacting proteins is limited by the abundance and relative ease of MS-based detection of these proteins. In addition to SAINT, we also compared detected proteins with the Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome). Additionally, we compared maximum spectral counts for proteins detected in association with E2 baits and found that these were consistently higher than those from control (no bait) purifications, indicating that a large number of detected proteins are bona fide interactors and are unlikely to be contaminants of the affinity purification process.

### Publication Abstract
Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification initiated by the E1 enzyme UBA1, which transfers ubiquitin to ~35 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. While UBA1 loss is cell lethal, it remains unknown how partial reduction in UBA1 activity is endured. Here, we utilize deep-coverage mass spectrometry to define the E1-E2 interactome and to determine the proteins that are modulated by knockdown of UBA1 and of each E2 in human cells. These analyses define the UBA1/E2-sensitive proteome and the E2 specificity in protein modulation. Interestingly, profound adaptations in peroxisomes and other organelles are triggered by decreased ubiquitination. While the cargo receptor PEX5 depends on its mono-ubiquitination for binding to peroxisomal proteins and importing them into peroxisomes, we find that UBA1/E2 knockdown induces the compensatory upregulation of other PEX proteins necessary for PEX5 docking to the peroxisomal membrane. Altogether, this study defines a homeostatic mechanism that sustains peroxisomal protein import in cells with decreased ubiquitination capacity.
