### Title
Cancer Serum PTM Profiling -  Quantitative profiling of post-translational modifications by immunoaffinity enrichment and LC-MS/MS in cancer serum without immunodepletion

### Description
Quantitative profiling study of post-translational modifications was done by using antibody based enrichment and LC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
Serum samples of cancer patients were subject to trypsin digestion and immunoaffinity enrichment using different PTM motif antibodies followed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Raw files were searched by Sequest and quantification of each identified peptide was done using label-free quantification

### Publication Abstract
A robust method was developed and optimized for enrichment and quantitative analysis of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in serum/plasma samples by combining immunoaffinity purification and LC-MS/MS without depletion of abundant proteins. The method was used to survey serum samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer (BC), and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Peptides were identified from serum samples containing phosphorylation, acetylation, lysine methylation, and arginine methylation. Of the PTMs identified, lysine acetylation (AcK) and arginine mono-methylation (Rme) were more prevalent than other PTMs. Label-free quantitative analysis of AcK and Rme peptides was performed for sera from AML, BC, and NSCLC patients. Several AcK and Rme sites showed distinct abundance distribution patterns across the three cancer types. The identification and quantification of posttranslationally modified peptides in serum samples reported here can be used for patient profiling and biomarker discovery research.
