### Title
XL-MS Analysis of Recombinant GPR158:RGS7:Gb5 Complex in Detergent Micelles

### Description
GPR158 is widely expressed in the brain and have been implicated in depression, cognition, mood and several cancers. GPR158 is also involved in retinal photoreceptor signaling along with it involvement in synaptic organization. GPR158 interact with G-protein regulator-RGS7 and brings it to plasma membrane to allosterically modulate GTPase activity of G-protein alpha subunit. However, the signaling mechanism and it structural organization is not known. The mnuscript associated with this deposition describes a structural analysis of GPR158 in complex with downstream effectors RGS7 and Gb5. This deposition pertains to the crosslinking mass spectrometry experiments conducted to complement these efforts.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation: GPR158:RGS7:Gb5 protein samples were concentrated to 10 Î¼M and crosslinked in protein buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 at 25 Â°C, 100 mM NaCl, and 25 Î¼M TCEP, 0.005 % LMNG, 0.001 % CHS). Reactions were initiated by spiking 1 Î¼L of 75 mM DSSO (Thermo-Fisher) in DMSO into a 50 uL solution containing 10 uM protein and mixing. The final molar ratio of crosslinker:protein was 150:1. The reactions were incubated at 25Â°C for 45 minutes and quenched by the addition of Tris pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM. Each crosslink reaction was done in triplicate and the reaction replicates were pooled after quenching. Non-crosslinked negative controls were generated using the same procedure without the addition of DSSO. 10 uL samples of the pooled samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie staining to confirm the presence of crosslinked protein. The remaining 140 uL of crosslinked and non-crosslinked samples were then acetone precipitated at -20 Â°C overnight and the protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 rcf for 5 minutes at 4 °C. After decanting, the pellets were washed with 1 mL of ice cold acetone and pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 rcf for 5 minutes at 4 °C. After decanting a second time, the pellets were dried for 15 minutes at room temperature before being resuspended in 12.5 uL of resuspension buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 8 M urea, pH 8.0). 5 uL of a 1 % ProteaseMAX (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to each solution. The protein solutions were mixed on an orbital shaker operating at 400 RPM for 5 minutes. After resuspension, 82.5 uL of digestion buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) was added. The protein samples were reduced by adding 1 uL of 500 mM DTT and incubating at 56 °C for 20 minutes in an orbital shaker operating at 400 RPM. After reduction, 2.7 uL of 550 mM iodoacetamide was added and the solutions were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. Reduced and alkylated protein solutions were digested using trypsin at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w trypsin:protein) and incubating at 37 °C for 4 hours. After trypsin digestion, 50 uL of tryptic peptide solutions were removed and 1 uL of chymotrypsin was added for sequential digestion. Both trypsin and trypsin-chymotrypsin digests were incubated at 25 Â°C for 16 hours. The resulting peptide samples were acidified by the addition of 25 uL of 2.0 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Thermo-Fischer). Samples were then frozen and stored at -80 °C until LC-MS/MS/MS analysis.  Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry: Peptide samples were thawed, vortexed, and spun down at 16,000 rcf for 5 minutes. 10 ÂµL of peptide samples were loaded in an Ultimate 3000 autosampler (Dionex, Thermo-Fisher). Approximately 1 Âµg of each peptide sample was injected in triplicate. Peptides were trapped on a µPAC trapping column (PharmaFluidics) using a load pump operating at 20 uL/min. Load pump buffer contained 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. After a 3 minute desalting period, peptides were then separated using linear gradients (2-30% Solvent B over 1-60 minutes, 30-95% solvent B over 60-90 minutes) at 800 nL/min on a 200 cm ÂµPAC C18 column (PharmaFluidics). Gradient solvent A contained 0.1% formic acid and solvent B contained 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The liquid chromatography eluate was interfaced to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo-Fisher) via nano spray ionization source. Crosslinks were identified using a previously described method (Lui et al 2017). Master scans of m/z 375-1500 were taken in the orbitrap mass analyzer operating at 60,000 resolution at 400 m/z, with automatic gain control target set to 400,000. Maximum ion injection time was set to 50 ms and advanced peak detection was enabled. Precursor ions with a charge state between 4-8 were selected via quadrupole for CID fragmentation at 25% collision energy and 10 ms reaction time. Fragment ion mass spectra were taken on the orbitrap mass analyzer operating at 30,000 resolution at 400 m/z, with an automatic gain control target of 50,000, and maximum injection time was set to 150 ms. Doublet pairs of ions with the targeted mass difference for sulfoxide fragmentation (31.9721 Da, Kao et al 2011) were selected for HCD fragmentation at 35% collision energy. MS3 scans were collected in the ion trap operating in 'rapid' mode at automatic gain control target and maximum ion injection time set to 20,000 and 200 ms, respectively.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis: Crosslinks were identified using the XlinkX algorithm (Liu et al 2015) implemented on Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2). Crosslinks were considered for lysine, threonine, serine, and tyrosine residues and the validation strategy was set to â€˜simpleâ€™ where relaxed and strict false discovery rates were set to 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. During database searches, the target databases only contained sequences for the proteins that were analyzed and the decoy database contained the reverse sequences. The maximum missed cleavages was set to 8. Cysteine S-carboxyamidomethyl and methionine oxidation were considered as dynamic modifications. Mass tolerances for precursor FTMS, fragment FTMS, and fragment ITMS were set to 10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 0.5 Da, respectively. Peak areas for identified crosslinks were quantified using Skyline (version 19.1) using a previously described protocol (Rappsilbur and Chen 2018). Crosslink spectral matches found in Proteome Discoverer were exported and converted to sequence spectrum list format using Excel (Microsoft). Crosslink peak areas were assessed using the MS1 full-scan filtering protocol for peaks within 8 minutes of the crosslink spectral match identification. Peaks areas were assigned to the specified crosslinked peptide identification if the mass error was within 10 ppm of the theoretical mass, the isotope dot product was greater than 0.95, and if the peak was not found in the non-crosslinked negative controls. The results from skyline were exported and are reported in an Excel spreadsheet.

### Publication Abstract
GPR158 is an orphan G protein&#x2013;coupled receptor (GPCR) highly expressed in the brain, where it controls synapse formation and function. GPR158 has also been implicated in depression, carcinogenesis, and cognition. However, the structural organization and signaling mechanisms of GPR158 are largely unknown. We used single-particle cryo&#x2013;electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human GPR158 alone and bound to an RGS signaling complex. The structures reveal a homodimeric organization stabilized by a pair of phospholipids and the presence of an extracellular Cache domain, an unusual ligand-binding domain in GPCRs. We further demonstrate the structural basis of GPR158 coupling to RGS7-G&#x3b2;5. Together, these results provide insights into the unusual biology of orphan receptors and the formation of GPCR-RGS complexes.
