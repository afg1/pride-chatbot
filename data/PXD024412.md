### Title
KRAS Epitope Identification Immunopeptidomics

### Description
Utilizing computational epitope prediction and biochemical assays we predicted and identified high-affinity and/or high-stability KRAS peptides to high prevalence HLA class I molecules. Using single HLA class I allele lines and tumor cell lines in conjunction with MS spectrometry, selected mKRAS epitopes were identified as constituents of the HLA class I ligandome.

### Sample Protocol
MHC Class I peptides were enriched and analyzed by LC-MS/MS with mixed mode fragmentaton.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions) using no-enzyme specificity

### Publication Abstract
