### Title
Acetylome analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae

### Description
Our dataset provides the first system-wide analysis of lysine acetylation in S. pneumoniae.

### Sample Protocol
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 was cultured in THY medium and harvested at OD600 of 0.6. Then the collected cells were sonicated in SDS lysis buffer with protease inhibitor, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, nicotinamide and trichostatin a. Proteins were collected and digested with trypsin. The acetylpeptides were enriched with the anti-acetyllysine antibody beaded agarose (PTM biolab). Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed with the Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) was used to identify the acetylated sites and proteins.
