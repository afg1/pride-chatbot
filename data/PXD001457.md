### Title
Time course infection of HeLa cells by Chlamydia tracomatis

### Description
Human Hela cells were infected with Chtrac L2 at timepoints t2hrs, t4hrs, t10hrs, t24hrs and t43hrs including controls without infection at t0 and t24hrs.

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cells were cultivated as adherent cells, harvested at timepoints by NaDoc based solubilization buffer and prepared for tandem mas spectrometry by reduction and alkylation (TCEP; chloroacetamid) followed by in-solution digestion with trypsin. The tryptic digest were quantified and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Qexactive with Dionex RSLC; 50cm pepmap precolumn system) in technical triplicate optimized for label free quantification (4 hour gradient).

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant and Peresus as well as inhouse scripts were applied for protein ID and LFQ.  Tandem mass spectra were extracted, searched and quantified by MaxQuant (v2.3.0.5 or newer). The search was performed against Uniprot (reference proteome with isoforms) human, Chlamydia tracomatis L2 with common serum contaminants and enzyme sequences added, 1% FPR on protein and peptide levels, trypsin/P cleavage rule with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, 0.5 Da tolerance for MS/MS, Carbamidomethylation on cysteines as the sole fixed modification and oxidation of methionines and acetylation on protein N-terminal as variable modifications. Finally, we used a ratio count of 2 for quantification and the match-between-run-feature with a window of 2 min for quantification. Identifying enriched signatures for differentially expressed proteins. Proteins whose abundance changed significantly during differentiation were identified by applying ANOVA between the five time points with the following settings (Permutation-based FDR, P=0.05, S0=1, 250 randomizations) using Perseus.
