### Title
Molecular characterization of Histomonas meleagridis exoproteome with emphasis on protease secretion and parasite-bacteria interaction

### Description
Exoproteome from parasitic protists constitutes of extracellular proteins which play a fundamental role in multifactorial host-parasite interactions. Lytic factors, especially secreted proteases in extracellular milieu, are capable to modulate tissue invasion, thereby aggravating host susceptibility. Despite the important role of exoproteins during infection, exoproteomic data on Histomonas meleagridis are non-existent. The present study employed traditional 1D-in-gel-zymography (1D-IGZ) and micro-LC-ESI-MS/MS (shotgun proteomics), to scrutinize H. meleagridis exoproteomes, obtained from a clonal virulent and attenuated strains. Both strains were maintained as mono-eukaryotic monoxenic culture with Escherichia coli. We demonstrated active in vitro secretion kinetics of proteases by both parasites, with widespread proteolytic activity ranging from 17 kDa to 120 kDa. Based on protease inhibitor-susceptibility tests, a predominant repertoire of cysteine proteolysis was present in the parasite exoproteomes, with stronger activity from virulent H. meleagridis. Shotgun proteomics, aided by customized database, identified 176 proteins including actin, potential moonlighting glycolytic enzymes, lytic molecules such as pore-forming proteins (PFPs) and proteases like cathepsin-L like cysteine protease. To quantify the exoproteomic differences between the virulent and the attenuated H. meleagridis cultures, a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra mass spectrometric (SWATH-MS) approach was applied. Surprisingly results showed most of the exoproteomic differences to be of bacterial origin, involving metabolism and locomotion. By deciphering such molecular signatures, novel insights into an inherent complex in vitro protozoan- bacteria relationship was elucidated.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation The H. meleagridis exoproteomes were obtained following 6h serum-free incubation of each of three virulent and three attenuated H. meleagridis cultures. Concentrated cell-free filtrates were submitted to on-filter digestion to remove excess reagents, detergents and salts. This was followed by HPLC interfaced with micro electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Briefly, the exoproteomes were treated with protease inhibitors (1000 μM TLCK, E-64, PMSF, EDTA, and cOmplete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany)). Following this, 20µg protein from each samples were digested according to the standard eFASP protocol (enhanced filter-aided sample preparation) using Amicon Ultra 0.5mL Ultracel 10 K centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore, Burlington MA, USA). In brief, after washing, proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated with iodoacetamide. On-filter digestion was performed with trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using 4% sodium deoxycholate for 14 hours at 37°C. Afterwards, digested peptides were recovered from the filter with three changes of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Removal of sodium deoxycholate was achieved by phase transfer with ethyl acetate according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Extracted peptides were dried down in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Afterwards, a C18 cleanup step using Pierce™ C18 Spin Columns (Thermo Fischer Scientific; Waltham, MA; USA) was performed according to the manufacturer’s manual. Dried peptides were redissolved in 5% acetonitril (ACN), 0.5% triflouroacetic acid (TFA) for sample loading. Washing was performed using 5% ACN with 0.5% TFA. Finally, peptide elution was accomplished with 70%ACN with 0.1% TFA. Eluted peptides were dried down in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Dried peptides were redissolved in 0.1% aqueous TFA prior to LC-MS injection (4.5 µg protein absolute in 9 µl injection volume). All samples were spiked with standardized indexed retention time reference peptides (iRT-Kit; Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) for facilitation of retention time alignment (0.8 µl iRTs added to 40 µl sample). Acquisition of proteins for identification runs Peptides were separated on an Eksigent NanoLC 425 system using a microflow pump module (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Sample pre-concentration and desalting were accomplished with a 5 mm YMC-Triart C18 precolumn (500 µm inner diameter, 3 µm particle size, and 12 nm pore size) (YMC, Dinslaken, Germany). For sample loading and desalting ultra pure LC-MS grade H2O with 0.1% formic acid (FA) was used as a mobile phase with a flow rate of 10 µl/min. Separation of peptides was performed on a 15 cm YMC-Triart C18 column (300 µm inner diameter, 3 µm particle size, and 12 nm pore size; YMC, Dinslaken, Germany) with a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The gradient started with 3% B (ACN with 0.1% FA) and increased in two steps to 25% B (68 min) and 35% (73min). It was followed by a washing step with 80% B. Mobile Phase A consisted of ultra pure H2O with 0.1% FA. For mass spectrometric analysis the LC was directly coupled to a high resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (Triple TOF 5600+; Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). For information dependent data acquisition (IDA runs) MS1 spectra were collected in the range of 400-1250 m/z for 250 ms. The 40 most intense precursors with charge state 2–4, which exceeded 150 counts per second, were selected for fragmentation. MS2 spectra were collected in the range 200–1500 m/z for 50 ms. Precursor ions were dynamically excluded from reselection for 13 s. The HPLC system was operated by Eksigent Control Software version 4.2 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) and the MS by Analyst Software 1.7.1 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA).

### Data Protocol
The database consisted of translated amino acid sequences originating from the 3356 non-redundant contigs of the H. meleagridis transcriptome [translated: 12.10.2017], (study accession number PRJEB19109; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19109), E. coli proteins (n=219107) (UniPort taxonomy ID: 562, EcolX https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/562) [downloaded: 18.10.2017] and proteins from the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP) (n= 117) (ftp://ftp.thegpm.org/fasta/cRAP/crap.fasta) [downloaded: 18.10.2017]. Acquired raw data were processed with ProteinPilot Software version 5.0 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) for re-calibration and database searches. Mass tolerance in MS mode was set with 0.05 and 0.1 Da in MSMS mode for the rapid recalibration search, and 0.0011 Da in MS and 0.01 Da in MSMS mode for the final search. Parameters for database search were: trypsin digestion, cysteine alkylation set to iodoacetamide, search effort set to rapid ID. False discovery rate analysis (FDR) was performed using the integrated tools in ProteinPilot Software version 5.0 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Global false discovery rate was set to <1% on protein level.

### Publication Abstract
The exoproteome of parasitic protists constitutes extracellular proteins that play a fundamental role in host-parasite interactions. Lytic factors, especially secreted proteases, are capable of modulating tissue invasion, thereby aggravating host susceptibility. Despite the important role of exoproteins during infection, the exoproteomic data on Histomonas meleagridis are non-existent. The present study employed traditional 1D-in-gel-zymography (1D-IGZ) and micro-LC-ESI-MS/MS (shotgun proteomics), to investigate H. meleagridis exoproteomes, obtained from a clonal virulent and an attenuated strain. Both strains were maintained as mono-eukaryotic monoxenic cultures with Escherichia coli. We demonstrated active in vitro secretion kinetics of proteases by both parasite strains, with a widespread proteolytic activity ranging from 17 kDa to 120 kDa. Based on protease inhibitor susceptibility assay, the majority of proteases present in both exoproteomes belonged to the family of cysteine proteases and showed stronger activity in the exoproteome of a virulent H. meleagridis. Shotgun proteomics, aided by customized database search, identified 176 proteins including actin, potential moonlighting glycolytic enzymes, lytic molecules such as pore-forming proteins (PFPs) and proteases like cathepsin-L like cysteine protease. To quantify the exoproteomic differences between the virulent and the attenuated H. meleagridis cultures, a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra mass spectrometric (SWATH-MS) approach was applied. Surprisingly, results showed most of the exoproteomic differences to be of bacterial origin, especially targeting metabolism and locomotion. By deciphering such molecular signatures, novel insights into a complex in vitro protozoan- bacteria relationship were elucidated.
