### Title
Circadian Gene Expression in Mouse Renal Proximal Tubule

### Description
Circadian variability in kidney function has long been recognized but is often ignored as a potential confounding variable in in vivo physiological experiments. To provide a guide for physiological studies on the kidney proximal tubule, we have now created a data resource consisting of expression levels for all measurable mRNA transcripts in microdissected proximal tubule segments from mice as a function of the time of day. This approach employs small-sample RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) applied to microdissected renal proximal tubules including both S1 proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs) and S2 proximal straight tubules (PSTs). The data were analyzed using JTK-Cycle to detect periodicity. The data are provided as a user-friendly web page at https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/Circadian-Prox/. In PCTs, 234 transcripts were found to vary in a circadian manner (3.7 % of total quantified). In PSTs, 334 transcripts were found to vary in a circadian manner (5.3 % of total quantified). Transcripts previously known to be associated with corticosteroid action and transcripts associated with increased flow were found to be overrepresented among circadian transcripts peaking during the “dark” portion of the day (Zeitgeber 14-22), corresponding to the peak levels of corticosterone and glomerular filtration rate in mice.

### Sample Protocol
To identify proteins expressed at different levels at ZT12 (time of “lights off”) versus ZT0 (time of “lights on”), quantitative protein mass spectrometry was carried out  in whole right kidneys at ZT12 (n=3) and ZT0 (n=3) from mice. Kidneys were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Omni 1000 fitted with a micro-sawtooth generator) and lysed in 1 mL lysis buffer containing 1.5% SDS and 1X HALT™ protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, pH 8.5.   Sample protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).  Samples were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM TEAB for 1 hr, and then alkylated with 17 mM iodoacetamide for 1 hr in the dark (all in room temperature).  After that, six volumes of pre-chilled (-20°C) acetone was added to each sample to allow protein precipitation overnight.   The precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 10 min at 4°C.   After removal of acetone, the protein samples were digested with Trypsin/LysC (Promega) with 1:50 (enzyme : sample) weight ratio in 100 mM TEAB overnight at 37°C.  The digested peptides in each sample were quantified by using a colorimetric peptide assay kit (Thermo Scientific #23275).  For tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, equal amounts of peptide from each sample (500 ug) were dissolved in 100 ul of 100 mM TEAB following by labeling with TMT multiplex™ Isobaric Mass Tag (11-plex, Thermo Scientific A37725) per the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples (3 at ZT0 and 3 at ZT12) were pooled and desalted using Waters Oasis HLB columns (WAT094225), then dried  in a SpeedVac (Labconco) concentrator.  To enhance the peptide identification, the pooled TMT-labeled sample  was fractionated into 24 fractions using high pH reversed-phase chromatography (Agilent 1200 HPLC). The fractions were dried in SpeedVaC and stored in -800C. For LC-MS/MS, the fractions were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid, then carried out in an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with Dionex UltiMate 3000 nano LC system and an EASY-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrum raw files were searched against mouse UniProt reference proteome (downloaded on Nov. 28, 2022) using MaxQuant 2.2.0.0. The false discovery rate was limited to 1% using the target-decoy algorithm.

### Publication Abstract
Circadian variability in kidney function is well recognized but is often ignored as a potential confounding variable in physiological experiments. Here, we have created a data resource consisting of expression levels for mRNA transcripts in microdissected proximal tubule segments from mice as a function of the time of day. Small-sample RNA sequencing was applied to microdissected S1 proximal convoluted tubules and S2 proximal straight tubules. After stringent filtering, the data were analyzed using JTK-Cycle to detect periodicity. The data set is provided as a user-friendly webpage at https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/Circadian-Prox2/. In proximal convoluted tubules, 234 transcripts varied in a circadian manner (4.0% of the total). In proximal straight tubules, 334 transcripts varied in a circadian manner (5.3%). Transcripts previously known to be associated with corticosteroid action and with increased flow were found to be overrepresented among circadian transcripts peaking during the "dark" portion of the day [zeitgeber time (ZT)14-22], corresponding to peak levels of corticosterone and glomerular filtration rate in mice. To ask whether there is a time-of-day dependence of protein abundances in the kidney, we carried out LC-MS/MS-based proteomics in whole mouse kidneys at ZT12 and ZT0. The full data set (<i>n</i> = 6,546 proteins) is available at https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/Circadian-Proteome/. Overall, 293 proteins were differentially expressed between ZT12 and ZT0 (197 proteins greater at ZT12 and 96 proteins greater at ZT0). Among the regulated proteins, only nine proteins were found to be periodic in the RNA-sequencing analysis, suggesting a high level of posttranscriptional regulation of protein abundances.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Circadian variation in gene expression can be an important determinant in the regulation of kidney function. The authors used RNA-sequencing transcriptomics and LC-MS/MS-based proteomics to identify gene products expressed in a periodic manner. The data were used to construct user-friendly web resources.
