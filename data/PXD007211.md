### Title
Proteomic analysis of germinal vesicles from preantral vs antral follicles in the domestic cat model

### Description
The domestic cat germinal vesicle (GV), which is physiologically similar to the human GV, gains the intrinsic ability to resume meiosis and support early embryo development during the pre-antral-to-antral follicle transition. However, little is known about nuclear proteins that contribute to this developmental process. We performed proteomic analysis of GVs identified candidate proteins for oocyte competence acquisition.

### Sample Protocol
GVs were enriched and lyzed from preantral and antral follicles collected from two large batches of cat ovaries.To allow quantitative proteomic comparison of GVs from the two stages, equal amount of proteins from each sample were trypsin-digested and differentially labeled with tandem mass tags. Samples then were fractioned by strong cation exchange chromatography, sequenced via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were searched against the database for Felis catus from Uniprot, using the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 Sequest HT search algorithm and the MudPIT database search protocol.
