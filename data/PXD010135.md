### Title
In vitro - in vivo correlation of gut microbiome response to metformin

### Description
The ability of MiPro culturing model to recapitulate in vivo drug responses was evaluated through taxonomic and functional analysis of murine gut microbiome following metformin treatment.

### Sample Protocol
Microbial cell pellets were lysed by ultrasonication 4 % SDS and 8 M urea, followed by trypic digestion at 37oC.

### Data Protocol
Protein/peptide identification and quantification were carried out using the MetaLab software (version 1.0).
