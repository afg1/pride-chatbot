### Title
Emiliania huxleyi coccosphere associated proteins identification

### Description
The project aim was to identify proteins associated with the coccosphere of Emiliania huxleyi.

### Sample Protocol
Log-phase cultures grown under standard or low calcium (i.e. calcified vs non-calcified) were washed with media before dissolving any calcium carbonate with ETDA. The cell were gently pelleted, and the remaining supernatant analysed by mass-spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Searches were performed with Mascot and Comet, with downstream processing using the TPP.
