### Title
Systems-level organisation of yeast methylotrophic lifestyle

### Description
Changes in the proteome of Pichia pastoris cultures either grown on glucose or methanol were analysed using a 2D-chromatography based TMT labeling LC-ESI-MS workflow. Three biological replicates, with two technical replicates each, had been analyzed leading to six replicate data sets of both growth conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed in a SDS containing buffer, proteins were MeOH/chloroform precipitated, carbamidomethylated and digested with trypsin. Peptides were TMT labeled and fractionated using high ph reversed phase chromatography. The fractions were analysed using a LC-ESI-MS system.

### Data Protocol
The software Mascot was used for the identification of peptides and proteins by matching the observed spectra with a database containing unique P. pastoris protein sequences. Protein identification requires the match of at least 2 independent peptides with a score of >25. For quantitative analysis of the proteomics data, the software Isobar Version 1.7.5 was used (Breitwieser et al. , 2011).
