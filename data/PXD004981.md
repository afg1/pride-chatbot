### Title
Lapatinib action and resistance in breast cancer

### Description
We used an established cell line model of lapatinib resistance and employed explorative mass spectrometry to profile the proteome, kinome and phosphoproteome changes in an effort to systematically investigate initial inhibitor response and concomitant kinome reprogramming and signaling rewiring in resistance. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates

### Sample Protocol
Urea lysis; Trypsin digestion; Dimethyl-labeling; Phosphopeptide enrichment using a Fe-IMAC column connected to an Aekta HPLC; Chemoproteomic kinase enrichment using Kinobeags gamma; hSAX fractionation of full proteome digests; High pH reversed-phase micro-column fractionation of phosphopeptide containing Fe-IMAC eluates; MS analysis using a Q-Exactive Plus (HCD fragmentation)

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant1.4.0.5 with Andromeda, Perseus, Excel Variable Modification: Actely (Protein N-term), Oxidation (M), Phopsho (STY) Fixed Modification: Carbamidomethyl (C)
