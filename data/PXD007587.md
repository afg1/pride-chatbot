### Title
Sipros Ensemble Improves Database Searching and Filtering for Complex Metaproteomics

### Description
Complex microbial communities can be characterized by metagenomics and metaproteomics. However, metagenome assemblies often generate enormous, and yet incomplete, protein databases, which undermines the identification of peptides and proteins in metaproteomics. This challenge calls for increased discrimination of target identifications from decoy identifications by database searching and filtering algorithms in metaproteomics. Sipros Ensemble was developed here for metaproteomics using an ensemble approach to addressing this challenge.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from soil samples were extracted using NoviPure soil protein extraction kit from MoBio. Proteins from marine samples and E. coli were extracted using SDS lysis buffer. The extracted proteins were processed using FASP method and measured on LTQ-Orbitrap mass spec. More details regarding sample prep can be found in the manuscript.

### Data Protocol
Three diverse scoring functions from MyriMatch, Comet and the original Sipros were incorporated within a single database searching engine. Supervised classification with logistic regression was used to filter database searching results.
