### Title
5xFAD transgenic mouse Abeta proteoforms

### Description
In this study, we have evaluated amyloidosis-relevant Aβ proteoform flux using immunoenrichment and quantitative Top-Down Mass Spectrometry in a well-studied 5xFAD mouse model of age-dependent Aβ amyloidosis.

### Sample Protocol
In a cross-sectional study, 5xFAD mouse brain tissues were collected at ages ranging from 2 to 14.5 months old (N=3 per age group per sex) and flash frozen. Tissues were dounce homogenized and then fractionated by ultracentrifugation, followed by Aβ immunoenrichment. Denatured Top down mass spectrometry for identification and quantitation of Aβ proteoforms. Mass spectrometer was operated in Data dependent acquisition and targeted MS2 modes.

### Data Protocol
Aβ proteoforms were quantified using label free quantitation (LFQ) approach from DDA dataset with intact precursor, MS1, data as well as from targeted MS2 data acquisitions from mass spectrometer for robust detection of pre-determined list of Aβ proteoforms. DDA .raw files were processed using a cloud-based search on TDPortal (http://galaxy.kelleher.northwestern.edu, Code Set 3.0.2) against a Uniprot human proteome database30 (Taxon ID, 9606 Proteome ID, UP000005640) with curated histones (June 2020). SAS input sheet for Label-free quantitation (LFQ) with DDA data was created during the TDPortal search. For the tMS2 dataset, extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for the most abundant fragments were generated, and their peak areas were determined using Skyline software v21.1.0.14632.
