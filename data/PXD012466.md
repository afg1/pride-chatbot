### Title
DSSO,Xlink,LC-MSMS - DSSO as linker, study of protein-protein interaction by LC-MSMS

### Description
DSSO as linker, study of protein-protein interaction by LC-MSMS

### Sample Protocol
DSSO was added to protein complex, linked for 1h, qunched by tris. Cysteine residues were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 56℃ for 30 min and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature, dark. Sample were digested by Chymotrypsin at 37 ℃, pH 8, overnight, peptides desalting with C18 column, LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
raw data was analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 2.2 Xlink (ThermoScientific), under DSSO MS2-MS3 mode
