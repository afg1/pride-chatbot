### Title
To elucidate the molecular mechanism behind Krt17-mediated regulation of immune system process, we conducted a co-IP assay using the anti-KRT17 antibody coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify the KRT17-interacting proteins in MC38 cell

### Description
Proteomics analysi of bound to anti-KRT17 antibody compared to IgG in colorectal cancer cell.

### Sample Protocol
The gel was chopped into small fragments with a razor blade, destained, and subjected to digestion by modified porcine trypsin (50–100 ng per digestion; Promega).

### Data Protocol
ntact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70 000. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using NCE setting as 27; ion fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17 500. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans was applied for the top 20 precursor ions above a threshold ion count of 1E4 in the MS survey scan with 30.0s dynamic exclusion.
