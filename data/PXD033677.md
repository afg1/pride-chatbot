### Title
Forensic skin for ecchymosis wound characterization

### Description
skin proteomics for ecchymosis wound characterization

### Sample Protocol
Full thickness human skin samples, comprising epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue, were collected at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Milano. Before shotgun and label free Mass Spectrometric (MS) analysis, the proteolytic digests were desalted using Zip-Tip C18.

### Data Protocol
The protein groups identified by MaxQuant, deriving from cases with unknown wound dating, were analyzed by the Perseus software (version 1.5.5.3) [Ref da decidere]. Hits to the reverse database were eliminated and the label-free quantification (LQF) intensities were converted to a log scale (log2). The reproducibility of the protein extraction was determined comparing dataset deriving from the first and the second protein extraction available for cases 1-12,1- E vs 4E, 1N vs 4N, 2E vs 5E and 2N vs 5N, in terms of number of identified proteins and LFQ intensity of the signals. The Pearson correlation coefficient values were calculated using the log2 LFQ intensity for the comparisons reported above.

### Publication Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has recently attracted the attention from forensic pathologists. This work is the first report of the development of a shotgun bottom-up proteomic approach based on rapid protein extraction and nano-liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry applied to full-thickness human skin for the differential analysis of normal and ecchymotic tissues to identify new biomarkers for bruise characterization and dating. We identified around 2000 proteins from each pooled extract. The method showed excellent precision on independent replicates, with Pearson correlation coefficients always higher than 95%. Glycophorin A, a known biomarker of vital wounds from immunochemical studies, was identified only in ecchymotic tissues, as confirmed by Western blotting analysis. This finding suggests that this protein can be used as a MS-detectable biomarker of wound vitality. By focusing on skin samples from individuals with known wound dating, besides Glycophorin A, other proteins differentially expressed in ecchymotic samples and dependant on wound age were identified, although further analysis on larger datasets are needed to validate these findings. This study paves the way for an in-depth investigation of the potential of MS-based techniques for wound examination in forensic pathology, overcoming the limitations of immunochemical assays.
