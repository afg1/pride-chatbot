### Title
Estimation of relative biomasses in microbiota

### Description
Presentation of a new methodology to assess microbiota relative quantifications in metaproteomics

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LTQ Orbitrap XL and Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were assigned to taxa using in house scripts using NCBI references, with spectral counts as taxon abundance proxy.
