### Title
Relative quantification from chemostats cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D, Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS 6556 and Yarrowia lipolytica W29

### Description
Relative quantification of protein abundances of three yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D, Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS6556 and Yarrowia lipolytica W29) cultivate in chemostats under different conditions.   The conditions for Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D are: - Standard condition – 30°C, pH 5.5 - High temperature - 36°C, pH 5.5 - Low pH - 30°C, pH 3.5 - Osmotic stress – 30°C, pH 5.5, 1M KCl  The conditions for Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS6556 are:  - Standard condition – 30°C, pH 5.5 - High temperature - 40°C, pH 5.5 - Low pH - 30°C, pH 3.5 - Osmotic stress – 30°C, pH 5.5, 0.6 M KCl  The conditions for Yarrowia lipolytica W29 are:  - Standard condition - 28°C, pH 5.5 - High temperature - 32°C, pH 5.5 - Low pH - 28°C, pH 3.5  This study is part of the OMICS data generation of CHASSY project (European Union’s Horizon 2020 grant agreement No 720824).

### Sample Protocol
Aliquots of 80 µg of total proteins extract suspended in lysis buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea,  5 mM DTT, 0.1 M TRIS-HCl pH=8 and proteases inhibitor cocktail) were used for proteome analysis.  Protein extracts were alkylated with iodoacetamide at 50 mM (final concentration), digested 3 hours at 37 °C with LysC-Protease (ThermoFisher Scientific ref. 90051), digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (Promega ref. V511). Desalting was carried out by using Strata-X columns (Phenomenex, ref. 8B-S100-TAK).  Digested peptides were concentrated under vacuum to dryness and resuspended in loading buffer (0.08% TFA and 2% ACN) for analysis of 1 µg in an Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Data-dependent acquisition using High Collision Dissociation mode (details in Supplementary information).

### Data Protocol
Protein identification was performed using the search engine X!Tandempipeline 3.4.4. Data filtering was set to peptide E-value < 0.05, protein log(E-value) < –2 and to a minimum of two identified peptides per protein.  Protein quantification was carried out using the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI).
