### Title
Bacillus licheniformis exponential phase

### Description
Cytoplasmic, membrane and exo-proteome of cells growing in minimal medium

### Sample Protocol
Cytosolic protein: cells were disrupted by sonication, extract was centrifuged, supernatant corresponded to cytosolic protein; determination of protein concentration using RotiNanoquant, 1D gel, cut into 10 pieces, digested with trypsin overnight, nanoHPLC, measurement in OrbiTrap  Membrane protein: cells were disrupted by sonication, extract was centrifuged and afterwards ultra-centrifuged, pellet homogenized in high salt buffer and ultra-centrifuged, pellet homogenized in sodium carbonate and ultra-centrifuged, pellet washed with TEAB buffer and ultra-centrifuged, membrane proteins from the pellet dissolved in SDS sample buffer; 1D gel, cut into 10 pieces, digested with trypsin overnight, nanoHPLC, measurement in OrbiTrap or FT-ICR (membrane protein extraction protocol detailed in Eymann et al 2004, Proteomics 4: 2849-2876) Exoproteome: proteins were precipitated from culture supernatant with TCA, pellets wahshed several times with ethanol, proteins dissolved in SDS sample buffer, 1D gel, cut into 10 pieces, digested with trypsin overnight, nanoHPLC, measurement in OrbiTrap or FT-ICR
