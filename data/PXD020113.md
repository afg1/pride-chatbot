### Title
Parthenolide-treated HeLa cells and purified tubulin

### Description
Purified human tubulin treated with parthenolide and HeLa cells treated in vivo with parthenolide

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cells treated in vivo and TOG-purified tubulin treated in vitro with parthenolide. Reduction, alkylation, tryptic digestion, and unfractionated DDA analysis performed with an Orbitrap Q Exactive.

### Data Protocol
Spectral files were analyzed with MSFragger (v2.4) and Philosopher (v3.2.3) via FragPipe (v12.2) against reviewed Human proteins. Closed search with variable parthenolide modification (248.14124 Da) on cysteine and histidine, cysteine carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, and protein N-terminal acetylation. Sequential FDR filtering resulted in PSM-level FDRs below 0.09%.
