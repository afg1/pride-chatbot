### Title
Unbiased placental secretome characterization identifies candidates for pregnancy complications

### Description
Proteomics assessment of supernatants, cell contents of trophoblasts were performed to identify what proteins are secreted from this particular placental region.

### Sample Protocol
Tissue from murine placenta was cultured and the conditioned media was loaded onto an SDS PAGE gel, and bands were excised and analysed by LC-MS/MS.  Primary cultured trophoblasts were extracted with an acetonitrile based extraction and the supernatant digested and analysed by LC-MS/MS.  Trophoblast cells were sorted using FACS, and the cells distrupted using an acetonitrile based extraction method before tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis.  Plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant mice were extracted using an acetonitrile based extraction and the supernatant put through an secondary SPE clean up step. The extracts were then digested and analysed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
PEAKS was used to process the LC-MS data, with fixed carbamidomethylations on cysteines, and variable modifications of methionine oxidation.
