### Title
Paradoxical drug sensitization of lung cancer cells by stromal fibroblast-secreted IGF-binding proteins:  Phosphotyrosine Profiling

### Description
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment often linked to drug resistance. Here, we report that CAFs, but not normal fibroblasts, can promote either resistance or unexpected drug sensitization of different lung cancer cells. Using unbiased secretomics, transcriptomics and tyrosine phosphoproteomics, we observed differential expression of several IGF1R signaling components, such as IGF-binding proteins and IGF1/2, and downstream signaling effects on cancer cells by fibroblasts. IGF1/2 treatment or IGFBP5 silencing in CAFs reversed, while addition of exogenous IGFBPs or pharmacological IGF1R inhibitors phenocopied the sensitizing effects. Combining IGF1R and EGFR inhibitors synergized in 2D and 3D models of different drug-resistant and naïve EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells and decreased tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that multiple resistance mechanisms coexist within the same cancer cells, that CAFs context-dependently cause drug resistance or sensitization, and that understanding both of these differential mechanisms leads to improved therapeutic approaches.

### Sample Protocol
For each condition, PC9GR cells were plated in ten 15 cm dishes at 7x106 cells/dish in a 1:1 mixture of RPMI10 and (serum-containing) CM from CAF or NAF cells and allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to a 3 h treatment with 500 nM osimertinib or DMSO, as control. To collect the cells, the media was decanted, the cells rinsed twice with ice cold PBS containing sodium vanadate and then scraped off the plate and collected in ice cold PBS containing sodium vanadate. Cells were centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min, the PBS aspirated and the cell pellet shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further processing. Samples were prepared as biological triplicates.Cells were lysed in denaturing lysis buffer containing 8M urea, 20 mM HEPES (pH 8), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM -glycerophosphate. A Bradford assay was carried out to determine the protein concentration and samples were denatured, digested and desalted as described above. Following lyophilization, the dried peptide pellet was re-dissolved in immunoaffinity purification buffer containing 50 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 10 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM sodium chloride. Phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were immunoprecipitated with immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine antibody p-Tyr-1000 (Cell Signaling Technology). After 2 h incubation, the antibody beads were washed 2 times with IAP buffer, followed by 3 washes with H2O. The phosphotyrosine peptides were eluted twice with aqueous 0.15% TFA, and the volume was reduced to 20 µl via vacuum centrifugation prior to LC-MS/MS as described above.Samples were injected as technical duplicates resulting in 6 values (3 biological x 2 technical) per sample (24 total injections).  A nanoflow ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph (RSLC, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced with an electrospray bench top orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo, San Jose, CA) was used for tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing. The sample was first loaded onto a pre-column (100 µm ID x 2 cm packed with C18 reversed-phase resin, 5 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size) and washed for 8 min with aqueous 2% acetonitrile and 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. The trapped peptides were eluted onto the analytical column, (C18, 75 µm ID x 25 cm length, 2 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The 90 min gradient was programmed as: 95% solvent A (aqueous 2% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) for 8 min, solvent B (90% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) from 5% to 38.5% in 60 min, then solvent B from 50% to 90% B in 7 min and held at 90% for 5 min, followed by solvent B from 90% to 5% in 1 min and re-equilibration for 10 min. The flow rate on the analytical column was 300 nL/min. Sixteen tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner following each survey scan. MS/MS scans were performed using a 15 sec exclusion for previously sampled peptide peaks.

### Data Protocol
For this upload, database searches were performed with Mascot.  For the manuscript, MaxQuant was used to quantify the intensities68. 907 tyrosine phosphorylated peptides were identified with a PEP score less than 0.05. After log2 conversion of the peptide intensities, the technical replicates were averaged and peptides with 0 or 1 value only per treatment triplicate across all treatments were deleted resulting in 847 peptides corresponding to 484 proteins. The samples were subjected to the t-test (two-tailed, two-sample equal variance) comparing the 4 conditions (3 biological replicates each) to each other to determine p-values for significant differences between them (e.g., CAF CM DMSO vs CAF CM Osimertinib or CAF CM DMSO vs NAF CM DMSO, etc.). Biological triplicates were then averaged and the log2 ratio was determined between the samples. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 and DAVID pathway analysis72. Phosphopeptides were manually confirmed by extracted ion chromatograms.

### Publication Abstract
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment are often linked to drug resistance. Here, we found that coculture with CAFs or culture in CAF-conditioned medium unexpectedly induced drug sensitivity in certain lung cancer cell lines. Gene expression and secretome analyses of CAFs and normal lung-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) revealed differential abundance of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which promoted or inhibited, respectively, signaling by the receptor IGF1R and the kinase FAK. Similar drug sensitization was seen in gefitinib-resistant, <i>EGFR</i>-mutant PC9GR lung cancer cells treated with recombinant IGFBPs. Conversely, drug sensitivity was decreased by recombinant IGFs or conditioned medium from CAFs in which <i>IGFBP5</i> or <i>IGFBP6</i> was silenced. Phosphoproteomics and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array analyses indicated that exposure of PC9GR cells to CAF-conditioned medium also inhibited compensatory IGF1R and FAK signaling induced by the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Combined small-molecule inhibition of IGF1R and FAK phenocopied the CAF-mediated effects in culture and increased the antitumor effect of osimertinib in mice. Cells that were osimertinib resistant and had <i>MET</i> amplification or showed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition also displayed residual sensitivity to IGFBPs. Thus, CAFs promote or reduce drug resistance in a context-dependent manner, and deciphering the relationship between the differential content of CAF secretomes and the signaling dependencies of the tumor may reveal effective combination treatment strategies.
