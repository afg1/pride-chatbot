### Title
ESCRT complexes in Giardia intestinalis (VPS20L)

### Description
To access ESCRT subunit presence, distribution and main interactors, we performed iterative co-immunoprecipitation on recombinant Giardia subunits.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were crosslinked in formaldehyde and lysed. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-HA beads. After bead elution, samples were loaded into a gel and bands were analysed by LC-MS.

### Data Protocol
Data was analysed with Scaffold (versionn 4). Exclusive spectrum counts were analysed using the 95-2-95 (protein/peptide) criterion. Samples derived from transgenic parasite were compared with samples of wild type. Proteins found on both samples were deemed not specific to the datatset.
