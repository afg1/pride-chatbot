### Title
Venomics of the East African green mamba and black mamba, highlights the complexity of their toxin arsenal

### Description
Complementary bottom-up MS/MS analyses for the venom phenotype map for the eastern green mamba and black mamba

### Sample Protocol
RP-HPLC-fractionated proteins were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and submitted to SDS-(15%)PAGE under reducing conditions. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250-stained bands were excised from the gel and and subjected to in-gel reduction (10 mM dithiothreitol) and alkylation (50 mM iodacetamide), followed by overnight sequencing-grade trypsin digestion (66 ng/?L in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 10% acetonitrile; 0.25 ?g/sample). Tryptic digests were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, redissolved in 15 ?L of 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, and submitted to LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an HPLC system (Agilent, Waldbron, Germany).

### Data Protocol
MSMS spectra were serach against a NCBI proteine database of Dendroaspis, using X!Tandem und Peptideshaker. All spectra peptide matches were validated manually (marked as confident).
