### Title
HpZ-interactome-analysis in hepatoma cells

### Description
We aim to identify the real interaction proteins of a HBV gene HpZ in cells.

### Sample Protocol
Cells transfected with HpZ-overexpression plasmid or vector, and co-immunoprecipitation was performed and eluted by 8M urea. Elutes were send for MS using trypsin digestion.

### Data Protocol
We searched the composite library (this library is constructed by adding the HpZ sequence into the UniProt human proteome, Proteome ID: UP000005640) of spectra obtained by mass spectrometry using Protein Discoverer software, and the false discovery rate (FDR) is evaluated by the consensus workflow integrated in the Protein Discoverer software. All proteins with a q-value higher than specified threshold (Target FDR: 0.01) will receive high confidence. All proteins with a q-value higher than specified threshold (Target FDR: 0.05) will receive medium confidence.
