### Title
CSF chitinase 3-like 2 is associated with disability progression in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis

### Description
Background: We aimed to identify long-term prognostic protein biomarkers associated with disease progression in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained from a discovery cohort of 28 patients with progressive MS who participated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial with interferon-beta. Patients were classified into high and low disability progression phenotypes according to numeric and step-based progression rates. Protein abundance was measured by shotgun proteomics using liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis. Selected proteins from the discovery cohort were quantified by parallel reaction monitoring in CSF samples from an independent validation cohort of 41 patients with progressive MS classified also into high and low disability progression phenotypes.  Results: Out of 1582548 CSF proteins identified in the discovery cohort, ten proteins were selected for validation based on the number of significant differences observed in the progression rates between patients with high and low disability progression: SPATS2-like protein (SPATS2L), Chitinase 3-like 2 (CHI3L2), plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5), Metallothionein-3 (MT3), Phospholipase D4 (PLD4), Beta-hexosaminidase (HEXB), Neurexophilin-1 (NXPH1), Adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1), Cathepsin L1 (CTSL), and Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Only CHI3L2 was validated, exhibiting significantly higher CSF protein levels and CSF protein levels were significantly higher in patients with high disability progression compared to patients with low disability progression. CSF CHI3L2 levels showed good performance to discriminate between progressive MS patients with high and low disability progression. Conclusions: Although further confirmatory studies are needed, we propose CSF CHI3L2 as a prognostic protein biomarker associated with disability progression in progressive MS patients.

### Sample Protocol
Levels of selected proteins were measured following a targeted proteomics approach with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). For each patient, 80 µL of CSF were used for protein precipitation in cold acetone overnight at 4ºC. Pellets were then solubilized in 6 M urea in ammonium bicarbonate 200 mM, reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol, alkylated with 200 mM iodoacetamide, and digested with LysC 1:10 ratio (w:w; enzyme:substrate) at 37ºC overnight followed by trypsin 1:10 ratio (w:w; enzyme:substrate) at 37ºC for 8 hours. Tryptic peptide mixtures were desalted using a C18 UltraMicroSpin column (The Nest Group, Inc.). For each targeted peptide, an isotopically-labeled counterpart (13C6,15N2-Lys and 13C6,15N4-Arg, Pepotec Peptides, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was spiked in the peptide mixtures and used as internal standard for quantification purposes. Up to two unique peptides per protein were selected for targeted protein quantification. For each selected peptide, an isotopically-labeled peptide (13C6,15N4-Arginine, and 13C6,15N2-Lys) was spiked in the samples and used as internal standard for quantification by PRM. The amount of internal standard peptide to be spiked in each sample was evaluated using dilution curves and the final concentration was chosen based on the following criteria: (i) to be within the concentration range in which a linear response of the peptide was observed; and (ii) to have an area as close to the endogenous peptide area as possible. Digested samples were analysed by PRM using an Orbitrap Eclipse coupled to an EASY-nanoLC 1200 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 50-cm C18 chromatographic column (Easy-Spray Column, PepMap RSLC C18). Peptide mixes were separated with a chromatographic gradient starting at 5% B with a flow rate of 300 nL/min and going up to 22% B in 79 min and to 32% B in 11 min (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water. Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The Orbitrap Eclipse was operated in positive ionization mode with an EASY-Spray nanosource at 1.4kV and at a source temperature of 275 ºC.  A scheduled PRM method was used for data acquisition with a quadrupole isolation window set to 1.4 m/z and MS2 scans over a mass range of m/z 300-2000, with detection in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a 30K resolution. MS2 fragmentation was performed using HCD fragmentation at 30 NCE, the auto gain control (AGC) was set at 1E5 and the maximum injection time (IT) at 54 ms. The size of the scheduled window was 6 min and the maximum cycle time was 1 s. All data was acquired with XCalibur software.

### Data Protocol
Product ion chromatographic traces corresponding to the targeted precursor peptides were evaluated with Skyline software v.20.1 based on (i) co-elution of endogenous and internal standard peptides; (ii) the number of detected traces;  iii) correlation of the trace relative intensities between endogenous and internal standard peptides; and (iv) expected retention time. Normalization was performed based on the median abundance of the internal standard peptides across all runs. Protein abundance estimates was performed with the software package MSstats 3.8.2.
