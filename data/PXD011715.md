### Title
Metabolic consequences of mitochondrial genome loss

### Description
Yeast metabolic deficiency induced by deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was investigated by microflow SWATH proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Single colonies of respective yeast strains were grown to mid-log phase (OD600 ~ 0.7) in selective medium containing 2 % glucose, harvested by centrifugation and snap-frozen in aliquots equalling 10 OD600 units. Sample preparation was carried out as previously described (Vowinckel et al, Sci. Rep. 2018). SWATH LC-MS/MS analysis was performed essentially as previously described (Vowinckel et al., Sci. Rep. 2018) on a TripleTOF5600 instrument (SCIEX) online coupled to a nanoACQUITY chromatographic system (Waters) operating at 3 Î¼L/min flow rate.

### Data Protocol
Ras data was analyzed using Spectronaut software (Biognosys) with a spectral library generated using MaxQuant software.
