### Title
Thraustochytrids, thraustochytrium sp.ATCC26185,LC-MSMS

### Description
This study focused on the effects of NaCl to squalene metabolism in Thraustochytrium sp. ATCC26185. The strain was cultured in different NaCl concentration medium, cells with highest specific squalene productivity were collected  for proteomic analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Cells with highest specific squalene productivity were collected in different NaCl condations (0, 5 g/L) for proteomic analysis by centrifuge. For each sample, 100Î¼g total protein  was digested. Eight fractions of digested peptids  of each sample were subjected to LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The raw data collected from MS/MS analysis was searched and analyzed using the pipeline programs integrated in the PatternLab for Proteomics (version 4.1.0.17; Carvalho et al., 2016). The normalized spectral abundance factor was  used to compare protein abundance in different groups
