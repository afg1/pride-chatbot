### Title
Proteomic Study of Different Culture Medium Serum Volume Fractions on RANKL-dependent Differentiating into Osteoclasts of RAW264.7 Cells

### Description
Supplemental data for the article: Proteomic Study of Different Culture Medium Serum Volume Fractions on RANKL-dependent Differentiating into Osteoclasts of RAW264.7 Cells

### Sample Protocol
cells were washed with cold PBS three times followed by the addition of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were obtained and protein concentrations were measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit. Then, 100 μg of protein was incubated in 10 mM dithiothreitol at 50°C for 1 h. Thereafter, proteins were incubated with 25 mM indole acetic acid in the dark for 2 h. Proteins were then digested with trypsin/ Lys-C Mix at a protein/protease ratio of 25:1 and incubated overnight at 37°C. The TMT Isobaric Label Reagent Set was used to labeling proteins following the manufacturer’s manual protocol.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using the Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software suite 1.3 with the SEQUEST search engine and the mouse FASTA database from UniProt (released on July 9, 2014).
