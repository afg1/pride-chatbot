### Title
O-GlcNAc sites of purified human neurofilament light Boyce Lab Duke Univ

### Description
O-GlcNac mapping using EtHCD data dependent method on a Fusion Lumos from in-gel tryptic digests of purified protein.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were isolated on an SDS-PAGE gel and then proteolytically in-gel digested with trypsin. Following peptide extraction, samples were subjected to separation on a 25cm x 75um ID HSS T3 UPLC column couled to a Fusion Lumos MS operating in a HCEtD method.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched against a human proteome with o-glcnac and phos selected as variable modifications on Ser and Thr residues within Protein Discoverer (Sequest). Data were analyze wihtin Scaffold and scored at a 1% FDR.
