### Title
Proteomic data of MG132 treated A. thaliana WT and ppi2

### Description
A mutation in the proteasomal lid subunit Rpn8a alters proteasome composition and exerts a beneficial effect on photosynthesis. The effect is particularly visible in a double mutant between rpn8a and the plastid protein import receptor Toc159 (ppi2xrpn8a) but also in an rpn8a single mutant that shows higher PSII efficiency and lower non-photochemical quenching. The double mutant shows elevated accumulation of pigments, higher levels of thylakoid membrane proteins and higher PSII quantum yield compared to the ppi2 single mutant. While proplastid-like pro-thylakoid structures are characteristic for ppi2, stacked thylakoids are frequently observed in the double mutant. The rpn8a mutation is accompanied by higher 20S and lower 26S proteasome abundance and increased expression levels of proteolytic stress markers. Unlike known retrograde signaling chains, there is no effect on the transcription of selected photosynthesis associated nuclear encoded gens (PhanGs). Since plastid precursor protein abundance is elevated in the double mutant it is conceivable that the changes in proteasome composition affect precursor stability. We propose a model in which mild proteasome impairment shifts the equilibrium between precursor import and degradation towards import, which is especially effective in plastid protein import mutants but also detectable in the wildtype background, albeit to a much weaker extent.

### Sample Protocol
After 2 days of stratification at 4°C the plants were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (M&S) medium supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) plant agar (Duchefa) and 0.8% (w/v) sucrose under short day conditions. For inhibitor treatments, plants were transferred after 7d into liquid MS medium with 0.8% (w/v) sucrose and cultivated for up to 28 d. WT and ppi2 seedlings were incubated in 50 µM MG132 or DMSO respectively for 30 h.

### Data Protocol
LC separation and HD-MSE data acquisition was performed as previously described (Helm et al., 2014 doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.12.007 ). Peptides were eluted in a linear gradient 7-35% mobile Phase B (0.1% (w/v) FA in acetronitrile) for 120 minutes. MS acquisition was set to 50–5000 Da. Data analysis was carried out by ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS 3.0.1)

### Publication Abstract
The proteasome is an essential protein-degradation machinery in eukaryotic cells that controls protein turnover and thereby the biogenesis and function of cell organelles. Chloroplasts import thousands of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins from the cytosol, suggesting that the bulk of plastid proteins is transiently exposed to the cytosolic proteasome complex. Therefore, there is a cytosolic equilibrium between chloroplast precursor protein import and proteasomal degradation. We show here that a shift in this equilibrium, induced by mild genetic proteasome impairment, results in elevated precursor protein abundance in the cytosol and significantly increased accumulation of functional photosynthetic complexes in protein import-deficient chloroplasts. Importantly, a proteasome lid mutant shows improved photosynthetic performance, even in the absence of an import defect, signifying that functional precursors are continuously degraded. Hence, turnover of plastid precursors in the cytosol represents a mechanism to constrain thylakoid membrane assembly and photosynthetic electron transport.
