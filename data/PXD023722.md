### Title
Protein idetification by using DNA pull-down & MS assay

### Description
Identification of proteins binding to the promoter of hrpR gene in Pseudomonas syringae using DNA pull-down & MS assay

### Sample Protocol
An 1076-bp noncoding DNA sequence upstream of the hrpR gene in Pseudomonas syringae was synthesized and labeled by desthiobiotin at the 5â€™-end. The bioinylated DNA probe then bound to the Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen), and the probe-bead complex was incubated with the bacterial nuclear extracts. Finally, the probe-bead-protein complex was eluted and detected by SDS-PAGE. The binding proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS (AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600-plus).

### Data Protocol
The raw data were processed in Proteinpilot V4.5 software with the following parameter setting: (1) Type of search, Identification;(2) Enzyme:Trypsin; (3) Cys Alkylation: Iodoacetamide; (4) Instrument; Triple TOF 5600; (5) Bias Correction: TRUE; (6) Background Correction: TRUE; (7) ID focus: Biological modifications; (8) Search Effort: Thorough ID; (9) Item: Value; (10) Protein Mass: Unrestricted; (11) Database: the protein sequences (Gnemome assession nnumbers CP032631.1 & CP032632.1).
