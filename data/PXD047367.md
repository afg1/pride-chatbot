### Title
Exploring Corneal Neovascularization: An Integrated Approach Using Transcriptomics and Proteomics in an Alkali Burn Mouse Model

### Description
Purpose Corneal neovascularization (CNV) impairs corneal transparency and visual acuity. The study aims to deepen our understanding of the molecules involved in CNV induced by alkali burns, facilitate a better grasp of CNV mechanisms, and uncover potential therapeutic targets. Methods Mice were selected for establishing CNV models via alkali burns. On days 3, 7, and 14 after the burns, corneal observations and histological investigations were conducted. An integrated analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptomics and label-free quantitative proteomics was performed in both normal and burned corneas. Bioinformatics approaches, encompassing GO and KEGG analysis, were applied to discern differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and crucial signaling pathways. Four potentially CNV-related genes were validated using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results Significant CNV was observed on the seventh day. Forty-one genes were differentially expressed in neovascularized corneas, with 15 upregulated and 26 downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these DEGs participated in diverse biological processes, encompassing retinol and retinoic acid metabolism, neutrophil chemotaxis, and actin filament assembly, along with significant enrichment pathways like cytochrome P450, tyrosine, and phenylalanine metabolism. The upregulation of lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1) and cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) genes and the downregulation of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) and transforming growth factor-beta-induced (TGFBI) genes were confirmed. Conclusions We analyzed gene expression differences in mouse corneas seven days after alkali burns, finding 41 genes with altered expression. The exact role of these genes in CNV is not fully understood, but exploring angiogenesis-related molecules offers potential for CNV treatment or prevention.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction from tissues was carried out using a cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (Beyotime, China) on ice for 15 minutes. Subsequently, the lysis mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were then collected to determine the protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China). The proteins were stored at −80 °C until preparation for analysis. For assessing protein quality, 20 µg of protein from each sample was separated on SDS‒PAGE gels (at a continuous voltage of 200 V for 40 min) and then stained with Coomassie blue. Each sample, comprising 100 µg of proteins, was first reduced with 100 mM DTT for 5 minutes at 100 ℃ and then alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes in the dark. Subsequently, the protein suspensions underwent digestion with 4 μg of trypsin (Promega) in 40 μL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer overnight at 37 ℃, and the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate. Finally, the peptide segment was desalted using a C18 column. The samples underwent chromatography using the Easy nLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), followed by analysis with an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The peptides (2 μg) were loaded onto the C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in buffer A (0.1% formic acid), followed by separation with a linear gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Mass spectrometry (MS) data was acquired using a data-dependent top10 method that dynamically chose the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (350–1200 m/z) for HCD fragmentation. MS1 scans were obtained with an AGC target of 300% and a maximum IT of 50 ms, acquired at a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200. Operating in a data-dependent mode with a cycle time of 1.5 s, MS2 scans were obtained at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200, with an AGC target of 75%, a maximum IT of 35 ms, and an isolation width of 1.6 m/z. The normalized collision energy was set to 33%, and the dynamic exclusion for selected ions was set to 30 s.

### Data Protocol
The MS raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.17.0) and searched against the database Uniprot_MusMusculus_17107_20220308_swissprot. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, while protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were considered variable modifications for database searching. The global false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01. Protein abundance was calculated based on normalized spectral protein intensity (LFQ intensity). Proteins with a fold change > 2 or < 0.5 and a p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).
