### Title
Proteomic analysis of WT, gun1-101, clpc1 and gun1clpc1

### Description
To understand the differences of the wild type, gun1, clpc1 and gun1clpc1 on the proteome level.

### Sample Protocol
Seedlings were grown in long-day conditions for 11 days, except for the double mutant, which was grown for 20 days to reach a similar developmental stage. Protein extraction and on-column digestion with trypsin were conducted according to Wu et al., 2018 (Plant Physiol. 176: 2472-2495). For MS analysis, peptides were separated on a nonaflow HPLC (EASY-nLC 1000, Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) using an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 2 µm, 250 mm LC Column (Thermo Scientific) with a 230 min linear gradient of 4.25-51% (v/v) acetonitrile, followed by a final peptide elution step for 10 min with 76.5% (v/v) acetonitrile. The Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) high-resolution Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer was used and run in positive ion mode. For full MS scans, the following settings were used: resolution: 70,000, AGC target: 3E6, maximum injection time: 100 ms, scan range: 200 to 2000 m/z. For dd-MS2, the following settings were used: resolution: 175000, AGC target: 1E5, maximum injection time: 50 ms, loop count: 15, isolation window: 4.0 m/z, NCE: 30. The following data-dependent settings were used: underfill ratio: 1%; apex trigger: off; charge exclusion: unassigned, 1, 5, 5–8, >8; peptide match: preferred; exclude isotypes: on; dynamic exclusion: 20.0 s.

### Data Protocol
Protein quantification was done with the MaxQuant software (Version 1.5.8.3). Unique peptides were used for quantification and post-data analysis was down with the Perseus software63. Proteins with a false discovery rate adjusted p value (q value, permutation-based) <0.05 and fold change >2 were considered as significantly different between genotypes. Additionally, proteins identified in all three replicates of one genotype with an averaged log2 protein intensity of more than 25, but not identified in all three replicates of the comparator genotype, were also considered as differential expressed proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Communication between organelles and the nucleus is essential for fitness and survival. Retrograde signals are cues emitted from the organelles to regulate nuclear gene expression. GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), a protein of unknown function, has emerged as a central integrator, participating in multiple retrograde signalling pathways that collectively regulate the nuclear transcriptome. Here, we show that GUN1 regulates chloroplast protein import through interaction with the import-related chaperone cpHSC70-1. We demonstrated that overaccumulation of unimported precursor proteins (preproteins) in the cytosol causes a GUN phenotype in the wild-type background and enhances the GUN phenotype of the gun1 mutant. Furthermore, we identified the cytosolic HSP90 chaperone complex, induced by overaccumulated preproteins, as a central regulator of photosynthetic gene expression that determines the expression of the GUN phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which protein import capacity, folding stress and the cytosolic HSP90 complex control retrograde communication.
