### Title
Semen proteome analysis comparing the persistent effects of different SARS-COV-2 variants on male reproductive system in recovered men

### Description
After the initial COVID-19 wave, India experienced a second COVID-19 wave in March 2021, which was driven by the delta variant. By January 2021, India has also begun its vaccine campaign. Therefore, semen samples from recovered patients who were infected during the two waves of COVID-19 in India were obtained to study the impact of variants on the male reproductive system. We compared samples from the second wave with those of first wave in India. We also included control samples to the comparison.

### Sample Protocol
The semen samples were collected by masturbating into sterile containers after three days of no sexual activity. The samples were stored at 37 °C for 30 minutes after collection in order to liquefy them before analysis. For this, a specific room with laminar flow was designated, and all COVID-19 protocols were followed. Prior to processing the samples for proteomics and storing them at 80°C, the samples underwent a precautionary step of heat inactivation of the virus at 56°C for 30 min. The protein extracts were transferred to MASSFIITB (Mass Spectrometry Facility at IIT Bombay) for proteomics investigation. Using the Ghosh et al. 2022 technique, LFQ-based discovery proteomics was used to examine the long-lasting impact of viral infection on the male reproductive system. The proteome data were collected in this work using a high-resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer connected to a simple nano-liquid chromatography (LC) system. The LC-MS/MS runs' parameters were as previously mentioned in Ghosh et al 2022.

### Data Protocol
We compared the second wave samples with the first wave samples and control (published earlier; PRIDE ID: PXD026703). The datasets were processed using Label-Free Quantification based parameter in MaxQuant against Uniprot human database (downloaded on March 11, 2022). Furthermore, using the built-in search engine, Andromeda, only proteins having a maximum of 1% false discovery rate and unique peptides greater than 1 were selected to increase the reliability of the data obtained. Trypsin was set as the enzyme for digestion with maximum permissible missed cleavage as 2. Carbamidomethylation at cysteine was set as static modifications, and Oxidation at methionine was kept as variable modification.

### Publication Abstract
<b>Introduction:</b> Changes to sperm quality and decline in reproductive function have been reported in COVID-19-recovered males. Further, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused the resurgences of COVID-19 cases globally during the last 2&#xa0;years. These variants show increased infectivity and transmission along with immune escape mechanisms, which threaten the already burdened healthcare system. However, whether COVID-19 variants induce an effect on the male reproductive system even after recovery remains elusive. <b>Methods:</b> We used mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approaches to understand the post-COVID-19 effect on reproductive health in men using semen samples post-recovery from COVID-19. The samples were collected between late 2020 (1st wave, n = 20), and early-to-mid 2021 (2nd wave, n = 21); control samples were included (n = 10). During the 1st wave alpha variant was prevalent in India, whereas the delta variant dominated the second wave. <b>Results:</b> On comparing the COVID-19-recovered patients from the two waves with control samples, using one-way ANOVA, we identified 69 significantly dysregulated proteins among the three groups. Indeed, this was also reflected by the changes in sperm count, morphology, and motility of the COVID-19- recovered patients. In addition, the pathway enrichment analysis showed that the regulated exocytosis, neutrophil degranulation, antibacterial immune response, spermatogenesis, spermatid development, regulation of extracellular matrix organization, regulation of peptidase activity, and regulations of calcium ion transport were significantly dysregulated. These pathways directly or indirectly affect sperm parameters and function. Our study provides a comprehensive landscape of expression trends of semen proteins related to male fertility in men recovering from COVID-19. <b>Discussion:</b> Our study suggests that the effect of COVID-19 on the male reproductive system persists even after recovery from COVID-19. In addition, these post-COVID-19 complications persist irrespective of the prevalent variants or vaccination status.
