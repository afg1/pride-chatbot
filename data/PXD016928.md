### Title
Proteome analyses of sperm from wild type, Akap3 and Akap4 gene null mutant mice

### Description
PKA signaling plays important functions during mouse spermatogenesis and for the regulation of sperm motility.  The efficiency of PKA signaling is regulated partly by its binding protein A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family.  Mature mouse sperm contain several AKAPs, of which AKAP3 and AKAP4 are localized in the principal piece of sperm tail and they are sperm-specific.  Using gene knock-out mouse models, it was found that both AKAP3 and AKAP4 are essential for the formation of a complete fibrous sheath, the electron-dense sub-cellular structure within sperm flagellum that is important for the motility of sperm and male fertility.  Lack of AKAP3 or AKAP4 caused aberrant sperm morphology and inmotility, leading to eventual male sterility.  In the present study, we investigated the changes of cellular proteome in the absence of AKAP3 or AKAP4 in mature sperm, using quantitative mass spectrometry.  It was found that global changes of sperm proteome occur in the absence of AKAP3 or AKAP4.  In Akap3 null sperm, proteins related to flagella structure, PKA signaling and motility regulations are down-regulated, whereas proteins involved in RNA metabolism, protein translation and actin filaments formation are accumulated.  Akap4 null sperm also displayed changes of sperm proteome at lesser extends.  These results suggest that both AKAP3 and AKAP4 are essential for the formation of sperm sub-cellular structures, proper regulation of PKA activity and motility of sperm, providing new clues to elucidate the molecular pathways that underlie the coordinated synthesis and organization of sperm proteome and sperm morphology

### Sample Protocol
Mature mouse sperm were isolated from vas deferens tubule from adult male mice at 2- to 3-month of age in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature and washed with a hypotonic solution (Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer, Beyotime, C3702) in order to get rid of contaminating blood cells.  Total proteins of sperm were extracted under denaturing condition (8 M urea, 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail).  Protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured using BCA method and equal amount of proteins from sperm of wild type, Akap3-/- or Akap4-/Y mice were taken and digested with trypsin.  Tryptic peptides were labeled using TMT kit/iTRAQ kit and mixture of labeled peptides were fractionated by high pH reverse-phase HPLC into 18 fractions using Agilent 300ExtendC18 column (5 ���������m particles, 4.6 mm ID, 250 mm length).  The fractionated peptides were then subjected toNSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Q ExactiveTMPlus (Thermo) coupled online to the UPLC.  Three experimental repeats were done for the mass spectrometry using wild type, Akap3-/- and Akap4-/Y mice (6 of each genotype, total of 18 mice) at either a same time or different times.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS/MS data was processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8).  Tandem mass spectra were searched against SwissProt Mouse Database concatenated with reverse decoy database.  Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missing cleavages.  The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in first search and 5 ppm in main search.  The mass tolerance for fragment ions was set at 0.02 Da.  Carbamidomethl on Cys was specified as fixed modification and oxidation on Met was specified as variable modifications.  FDR was adjusted to <1% and minimum score for peptides was set at >40.  Quantification of differentially expressed proteins was analyzed further using standard procedure.  Proteins identified in two experimental repeats and showed changes ���������1.3-fold (P > 0.05) were further analyzed by bioinformatics.  Protein extraction, peptide preparation and LC-MS/MS were performed by PTM Biolabs Inc. (Hangzhou, China).

### Publication Abstract
The development and maintenance of the correct morphology of sperm is important for their functions. Cellular morphogenesis of sperm occurs during the post-meiotic developmental stage; however, little is known about what coordinates this process. In the present study, we investigated the role of A-kinase anchoring protein 3 (AKAP3) during mouse spermiogenesis, using both mouse genetics and proteomics. It was found that AKAP3 is essential for the formation of the specific subcellular structure of the sperm flagellum, motility of sperm and male fertility. Additionally, lack of AKAP3 caused global changes of the sperm proteome and mislocalization of sperm proteins, including accumulation of RNA metabolism and translation factors and displacement of PKA subunits in mature sperm, which may underlie misregulated PKA activity and immotility in sperm. Interestingly, sperm lacking a complete fibrous sheath from both <i>Akap3</i> and <i>Akap4</i> null mice accumulated F-actin filaments and morphological defects during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. These results suggest that the subcellular structures of sperm could be formed via independent pathways, and elucidate the roles of AKAP3 during the coordinated synthesis and organization of the sperm proteome and sperm morphology.
