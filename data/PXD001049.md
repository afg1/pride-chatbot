### Title
Nitrated protein profile of rat hypoxic brain

### Description
In this work we have described the protein nitration profile in the brain of rats submitted to an experimental model of hypobaric hypoxia

### Sample Protocol
We have performed a 2D analysis of the samples followed by MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
The results found with the MS and MS/MS analyses were used to make a combined database search. Identifications relied on three matched peptides. Searches were restricted to Rattus norvegicus database using major spectral peaks and matching errors 50 ppm
