### Title
TMT analysis of LARP6 knockdown impact on protrusion induced changes in the proteome of MDA-MB231 cells

### Description
To assess if LARP6 is required for upregulation of ribosomal proteins upon protrusion induction, MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were treated with non-targeting (NT) or LARP6 siRNA for 48 hrs, before being seeded on top of collagen-I coated 3 micron transwell filters (corning). No media was added to the bottom chamber and cells were allowed to adhere to filter overnight. The next day, the media on top of cells was refreshed, and the filters were either left with no media in the bottom chamber (closed pores), or with media also added to the bottom chamber (open pores) in order to allow formation of protrusions. Cells were allowed to form protrusions for 12 hrs before being lysed and analysed by mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed in 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5. Isobraric Filter Aided Sample Preparation (iFASP) (McDowell et al., 2017) was performed for the generation of tryptic peptides as described before with modifications. From each sample, 25 micrograms of total protein were first reduced with 50 mM Bond-Breaker TCEP Solution (ThermoFisher) at 95 degrees C for 10 min. Reduced samples were then diluted in 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5 (UA buffer), transferred to Vivacon 500 filter, concentrated by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 20 min.Samples were then washed twice by addition of 400 micolitres of UA buffer to the filter tops and centrifugation, followed by alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Samples were further washed by UA buffer as before for three times, followed by three additional washes with 100 mM Dissolution Buffer TEAB to reduce the urea concentration. Trypsin digestion was then performed by addition of Trypsin in TEAB buffer to the filter tops and overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Each sample was then incubated with 0.2 micrograms of TMT label reagent at 25°C for 1 hour in a 600 rpm shaking thermomixer, and then quenched with 5% hydroxylamine at 25°C for 30 min in a 600 rpm shaking thermomixer. Peptides were eluted by centrifugation at 14,000 g. The elution was repeated three times following addition of TEAB buffer to the filter tops, and a final elution was carried out with 30% acetonitrile. Peptides were dried with a vacuum concentrator and fractionated via Pierce™ basic pH reverse-phase fractionation kit into 7 fractions. Samples were then dried with vacuum centrifugation before resuspending in A* buffer (2% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5% acetic acid) for LC-MS/MS analysis.   LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled with a nanoflow ultimate 3000 RSL nano HPLC platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equivalent of ~1 µg of each digested SILAC mix was subjected to LC-MS/MS. Briefly, samples were resolved at a flow rate of 250 nL/min on an Easy-Spray 50 cm x 75 μm RSLC C18 column with 2 µm particle size (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a 123 minutes gradient of 3% to 35% of buffer-B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) against buffer-A (0.1% formic acid in water), and the separated peptides were infused into the mass spectrometer by electrospray. The spray voltage was set at 1.95 kV and the capillary temperature was set to 255 ˚C. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent positive mode, with 1 MS scan followed by 15 MS/MS scans (top 15 method). The scans were acquired in the mass analyzer at 375-1500 m/z range, with a resolution of 70,000 for the MS and 17,500 for the MS/MS scans. Fragmented peaks were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (version 1.6.3.3) software was used for database search and isobaric quantifications (see mqpar.xml file for Maxquant setting details). The search was performed against a FASTA file of the Homo Sapiens, extracted from Uniprot.org (2016). All downstream data analysis was performed by Perseus (version 1.6.2.1), using the MaxQuant ProteinGroups.txt output file.
