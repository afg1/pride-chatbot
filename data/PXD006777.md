### Title
SIP experiment on flagellar cytoskeletons prepared using 1 M NaCl, Bound and Unbound Fractions

### Description
To identify protein constituents of the structures at the tip of the trypanosome flagellum

### Sample Protocol
Trypanosome flagellar cytoskeletons were prepared using 1 M NaCl, fragmented by sonication and the fragments with bound flagella connectors enriched by immunoprecipitation (bound material). Both bound and unbound fractions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, proteins visualized by Sypro Ruby staining (Lonza), and each gel lane cut into horizontal slices. Proteins in the slices were digested by trypsin, resulting peptides separated using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex) and analyzed with an LTQ XLOrbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific. Peptide fragmentation was performed by CID. Samples: Bound- B110406_008, B110406_009, B110406_010, B110406_011, B110406_012, B110406_013, B110406_014, B110407_003, B110407_004, B110407_005, B110407_006, B110407_007, B110407_008, B110407_009; Unbound- B110406_017, B110406_018, B110406_019, B110406_020, B110406_021, B110406_022, B110406_023, B110413_009, B110413_010, B110413_011, B110413_012, B110413_013 B110413_014

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified by searching MS/MS spectra against a custom Trypanosoma brucei protein database based on T. brucei genome version 2.2 (tritrypdb.org) using the Central Proteomics Facility Pipeline of Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, which combines results of Mascot, X!Tandem kscore and OMSSA searching engines. We allowed for up to two missed trypsin cleavages, a precursor mass tolerance of 20 p.p.m. and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da. Proteins were identified at a 1% false discovery rate.
