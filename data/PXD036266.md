### Title
25 kDa band from HSPA1A immunoprecipitation

### Description
HSPA1A was immunoprecipitated from WT and TorsinKO HeLa cells. A band around 27 kDa was identified uniquely in TorsinKO samples and for identification, this band was extracted.

### Sample Protocol
Eluted protein were digested in gel via trypsin. Protein Digests are analyzed using LC MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. This system are equipped with Waters nanoACQUITY ultra high pressure liquid chromatographs (UPLC) for peptide separation.

### Data Protocol
All MS/MS spectra are searched in-house using the Mascot algorithm for un-interpreted MS/MS spectra after using the Mascot Distiller program to generate Mascot compatible files. The Mascot Distiller program combines sequential MS/MS scans from profile data that have the same precursor ion. A charge state of +2 and +3 are preferentially located with a signal to noise ratio of 1.2 or greater and a peak list is generated for database searching. Either the NCBInr, a species specific, or a custom database (in FASTA format) are used for searching.
