### Title
Quantitative phosphoproteomics of chronic sunitinib treated renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells with GPR30 agonist G-1

### Description
In this project, we generated chronic sunitinib-treated 786-O cell, a renal cell carcinoma cell line. In order to investigate the possible effect of GPR30 agonist, G-1, on the growth-inhibtion related signaling pathways, we treated either parental both parental and chronic sunitinib-treated 786-O cells were treated either by vehicle-only (i.e. 0.1% DMSO) or 2 μM G-1 for 48 h. Therefore, there were three groups for comparison, including G-1 treatment (G-1 vs. parental), chronic sunitinib-treatment (SunR vs. parental), and G-1 treatment in SunR cells (SunR&G-1 vs. parental).

### Sample Protocol
Cellular proteins were harvested in a lysis buffer, which contains 4% SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate), 100 mM TEAB (triethylammonium bicarbonate), as well as protease & phosphatase inhibitor cocktails, and sonicated. After acetone precipitation, protein pellets were resuspended in 100 mM TEAB and 8 M urea. Protein concentrations were determined by tryptophan fluorescence. Resuspended proteins from each condition were then digested and dimethyl labeled. eptides from G-1 treated parental 786-O cells, vehicle-treated sunitinib-resistant cells, and G-1 treated sunitinib-resistant cells were labeled with stale isotopic formaldehyde (13CD2O, or heavy labeled). As for vehicle-treated parental 786-O cells, the peptides were labeled by formaldehyde (CH2O, or light labeled). After dimethyl labeling, equal amounts, i.e. 500 μg, of the heavy and light labeled peptides were mixed into three groups: G-1-treated parental vs. control cells (vehicle-treated parental cells), vehicle-treated sunitinib-resistant vs. control cells, and G-1-treated sunitinib-resistant vs. control cells. The mixed, dimethyl-labeled peptides were desalted. The desalted peptides were dried by speed-vac, resuspended in 6% acetic acid, and subjected to sequential phosphopeptide enrichment by Ga- and Fe-IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography).The eluted phosphopeptides were further fractionated into six fractions using high-pH reverse phase StageTip and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and dimethyl quantitation were analyzed using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.8)(Cox et al., 2014) against a reviewed SWISS-PROT sequence database (version 2016_05 with 20,207 human canonical protein sequences) as previously described (Chen et al., 2016). False discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide and protein levels were fixed at 1% in MaxQuant. In addition, the localization probability of each identified phosphorylation site, or phosphosite, was also determined by MaxQuant.  The MaxQuant-generated result was further analyzed by Perseus computation platform (version 1.6.2.3) (Tyanova et al., 2016). Only high-confidence phosphosites (localization probability > 0.75, or Class I phosphosites) (Olsen et al., 2006) were selected. The intensities of the Class I phosphosites were used for further analysis. The phosphosite intensities were normalized by internal reference scale (IRS) method (Plubell et al., 2017), log2-transfomred, and subjected to permutation FDR-test to identify potentially up- and down-regulated phosphosites (P < 0.01).
