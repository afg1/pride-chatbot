### Title
Beer yeast SWATH-MS proteomics

### Description
Identification and relative quantification of proteins present in the cell wall of yeast strains measured by SWATH-MS.

### Sample Protocol
Yeast samples were taken after growth in YPD or wort (brewing media), prepared by cell wall and whole cell extraction, reduced/alkylated, tryptic digest, peptide desalt by C18 Ziptip, peptide identification by LC-MS/MS on TripleTof 5600, SWATH measurement with identifical LC on TripleTof 5600.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification using ProteinPilot 4 searched against Uniprot. SWATH data processed using Peakview 2.1.
