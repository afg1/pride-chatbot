### Title
GFP TurboID in Human HCT116 cells

### Description
GFP-TurboID samples were generated as controls for several TurboID experiments in Human HCT116 cells.

### Sample Protocol
We generated HCT116 stable cell lines expressing GFP protein fused to TurboID in N-terminal. The labeling was initiated by the addition of biotin in the culture medium and the cells collected at two time points (30 minutes and 16 hours). Biotinlylated proteins were then enriched on streptavidin-coated beads and analyzed on a QExactive +  mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nanoLC-1000 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA).

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified with Mascot algorithm (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science, London, UK): the data were searched against the Swissprot database with Homo sapiens taxonomy (2020_05, 20 386 sequences) using the software’s decoy strategy. Mascot identifications were imported into Proline 1.4 software (Bouyssié et al., 2020) where they were validated using the following settings: PSM score <=25, Mascot pretty rank < = 1, FDR < = 1% for PSM scores, FDR < = 1% and for protein set scores. The total number of MS/MS fragmentation spectra was used to quantify each protein.
