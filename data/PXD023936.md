### Title
Exploring the glycosylation state of the Cryptosporidium parvum CpTSP protein family-HILIC glycopeptide enrichment

### Description
Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic apicomplexan parasite and a common cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. The development of vaccines to prevent or limit infection remains an important goal for tackling these diarrheal diseases, which are a significant cause of infant morbidity in the developing world. The only approved vaccine against an apicomplexan parasite targets conserved adhesins possessing a thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domains. Orthologous TSR domain-containing proteins are commonplace in the apicomplexa and C. parvum possess 12 such proteins. Here, we explore the molecular evolution and conservation of these proteins and examine their abundance in C. parvum oocysts to assess the likelihood that they may be useful as vaccine candidates. We go onto examine the glycosylation states of these proteins using antibody-enabled and ZIC-HILIC enrichment techniques, which revealed that these proteins are modified with C-linked Hex and N-linked Hex5-6HexNAc2 glycans.

### Sample Protocol
Protein pellets were resuspended in 100 µl denaturation buffer (20 mM NH4HCO3, 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea) with vortexing and the protein concentration re-determined by BCA assay. DTT (1 µl, 1 M) was added and the sample nutated for 60 min at 22 °C to complete peptide dissolution. 2-Chloroacetamide (50 µl, 100 mM) was added and the sample nutated with the exclusion of light for 60 min at 22 °C. The alkylation reaction was quenched with more DTT (4 µl, 1 M) and nutated for 10 min at 22 °C. The sample was diluted with 465 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3 before the addition of 20 µg trypsin (Promega) and incubation for 16 h at 25 °C and 500 rpm. The sample was acidified by the addition of 20 µl HCO2H, centrifuged (10,000×g, 10 min, 22 °C) and the supernatant applied to a 50 mg tC18 Sep-Pak column (Waters) conditioned in Buffer A (0.1% TFA, 2% MeCN, 97.9% H2O). The column was washed with Buffer A (3×800 µl), eluted with 800 µl Buffer B (0.1% TFA, 80% MeCN, 19.9% H2O) and the eluate dried on a SpeedVac system (ThermoFisher) then stored at -20 °C until further use.    ZIC-HILIC enrichment was performed as previously described with minor modifications {Mysling, 2010, Utilizing ion-pairing hydrophilic interaction chromatography solid phase extraction for efficient glycopeptide enrichment in glycoproteomics}. Briefly, A ZIC-HILIC Stage-tip {Rappsilber, 2007, Protocol for micro-purification`, enrichment`, pre-fractionation and storage of peptides for proteomics using StageTips} was created by packing 0.5cm of 10 µm ZIC-HILIC resin (Millipore, Massachusetts, United States) into p200 tips containing a frit of C8 Empore™ (Sigma) material. Prior to use, the column was washed with ultra-pure water, followed by 95% acetonitrile and then equilibrated with 80% acetonitrile and 1% TFA. The digested proteome sample was resuspended in 80% acetonitrile and 1% TFA. The whole proteome digest was adjusted to a concentration of 2 µg/µL (a total of 200 µg of peptide used for each enrichment) then loaded onto equilibrated ZIC-HILIC columns. ZIC-HILIC columns were washed with 20 bed volumes of 80% acetonitrile, 1% TFA to remove non-glycosylated peptides and bound peptides eluted with 10 bed volumes of ultra-pure water. Eluted peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at -20 ˚C.  The ZIC-HILIC enriched sample was re-suspended in Buffer A* (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) and separated using a two-column chromatography set up composed of a PepMap100 C18 20 mm x 75 μm trap and a PepMap C18 500 mm x 75 μm analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were concentrated onto the trap column at 5 μL/min for 5 minutes with Buffer A (0.1% formic acid, 2% DMSO) and then infused into an Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a FAIMS Pro interface at 300 nl/minute via the analytical column using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 185-minute analytical runs were undertaken by altering the buffer composition from 2% Buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 77.9% acetonitrile, 2% DMSO) to 23% B over 155 minutes, then from 28% B to 45% B over 12 minutes, then from 45% B to 80% B over 5 minutes. The composition was held at 80% B for 3 minutes, and then dropped to 2% B over 1 minutes before being held at 2% B for another 9 minutes. The Lumos™ Mass Spectrometer was operated in a stepped FAIMS data-dependent mode automatically switching between the acquisition of a single Orbitrap MS scan (120,000 resolution) every 2 seconds and HCD MS2 events (FTMS, 15K resolution, maximum fill time 80 ms, normalize collision energy 30, AGC of 250%) at three different FAIMS CVs -25, -45 and -65 as previously described {Ahmad Izaham, 2021, What Are We Missing by Using Hydrophilic Enrichment? Improving Bacterial Glycoproteome Coverage Using Total Proteome and FAIMS Analyses}. oxonium ions (204.0867; 138.0545 and 366.1396 m/z) product-dependent MS/MS analysis (38) was used to trigger three additional scans of potential glycopeptides; a Orbitrap EThcD scan (NCE 15%, maximal injection time of 250 ms, AGC 2*105 with a resolution of 30k and using the extended mass range setting to improve the detection of high mass glycopeptide fragment ions {Caval, 2019, Simply Extending the Mass Range in Electron Transfer Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation Increases Confidence in N-Glycopeptide Identification}]); a ion trap CID scan (NCE 35%, maximal injection time of 40 ms, AGC 5*104) and a stepped collision energy HCD scan (using NCE 35% with 8% Stepping, maximal injection time of 150 ms, AGC 2*105 with a resolution of 30k).

### Data Protocol
ZIC-HILIC enriched Glycopeptides were identified using glycosylation enabled MSfragger ({Polasky, 2020, Fast and comprehensive N- and O-glycoproteomics analysis with MSFragger-Glyco;Kong, 2017, MSFragger: ultrafast and comprehensive peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics} version 14.0) searching against the Cryptosporidium parvum (strain Iowa II) database (Uniprot :UP000006726, 3805 proteins downloaded 10-11-2020). The resulting data was visualized using ggplot2 within R by tallying the observed delta masses of identified glycopeptides.
