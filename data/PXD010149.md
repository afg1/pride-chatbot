### Title
Dataset in support of patients on clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis included in a study searching for novel putative biomarkers

### Description
Infective endocarditis (IE) has high mortality, partly due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Currently, no biomarker can identify IE in patients with fever and clinical picture of infection. To find putative biomarkers we analyzed serum levels of two proteins found in cardiac valves, osteoprotegerin and fibulin-1 among 689 and 696 patients on clinical suspicion of IE, respectively. In addition, proteomic analyses were performed in 24 patients with bacteremia, 12 patients with definite IE and 12 patients with excluded IE.

### Sample Protocol
Proteome Purify™ 12 immunodepletion resin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to deplete serum for 12 high abundant proteins, essentially as described by the manufacturer. To 30 L of serum was added 1 mL of suspended immunodepletion resin and left for 30-60 min. on a rotary shaker. The resin was applied to Spin-X filter units and centrifuged for 2 min. The proteins in the filtrate was then precipitated using 5 x vol. of 100% acetone at -20°C overnight. Samples were then centrifuged, washed with 50% acetone, dried and dissolved in 2D-PAGE lysis buffer (9 M urea, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2% (v/v) immobilized pH gradiet (IPG) buffer (pH 4-7), 2% (w/v) dithiotreitol (DTT)). Rehydraton buffer (8 M urea, 2% (wt/vol) CHAPS, 2% (vol/vol) IPG-buffer and 0.3% (wt/vol) DTT) was added and the amount applied to the 2D gels was 200 g. For the Proteominer Protein Enrichment Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) 1 mL of serum samples were incubated with the beads as described and finally eluted with 8M urea, 2% CHAPS. Proteins were acetone precipitated as above and dissolved in 2D-PAGE lysis buffer, rehydration buffer was added and an amount of 250 g was used for 2D-PAGE. For LFQ LC-MS/MS 30 g protein was mixed with reducing sample buffer and separated by 1D-PAGE (Biorad TGX 4-16%). The electrophoresis was stopped after migration of proteins approx. 1cm into the gel visualized by CBB. The gel plugs were excised and samples were reduced at 60°C using 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes and alkylated using 55 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes. Two g trypsin (Promega) was added to each gel sample and incubated overnight. The peptides were extracted by 50% acetronitrile and 0.1% formic acid followed by vacuum evaporation. The samples were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Each sample was injected in duplicate into a Dionex RSLC nanoUPLC system that was connected to a Quadrupole Orbitrap (Q ExactivePlus) mass spectrometer equipped with a NanoSpray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The flow settings were 8 μL per min. for the sample loading onto a trapping column, which was an Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 5μm column from Thermo Scientific. The nanoflow was set to 300 nL per min for the peptide separation on the analytical column, which was a 50 cm Acclaim Pepmap RSLC, 75 μm inner diameter column connected with nanoviper fittings. The nano-electrospray was done using a Picotip ‘Silicatip’ emitter from New Objective. The LC buffers were buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The applied gradient was from 10 to 45% buffer B over 35 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. A full MS scan in the mass range of 350 to 1850 m/z was acquired at a resolution of 70,000 with an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum fill time set to 250 ms. Instrument lock mass correction was applied using the contaminant ion at 391.28429 m/z. In each cycle, the mass spectrometer will trigger up to 12 MS/MS acquisitions on abundant peptide precursor ions. The MS/MS scans were acquired with a dynamic mass range at a resolution of 17,500, and with an AGC target of 2e5 and max fill time of 60 ms. The precursor ions were isolated using a quadrupole isolation window of 1.6 m/z and then fragmented in the HCD trap with a normalized collision energy set to 30. The under-fill ratio was set to 3.5% with the intensity threshold at 1.2e5. Apex triggering was 3 to 10 s with charge and exclude isotopes exclusion on, and dynamic exclusion set to 30 s. P

### Data Protocol
rotein identification and quantification were done with MaxQuant (v 1.5.5.1) [27]. The reviewed human Swiss-Prot sequence database was downloaded on the 25th of August 2016 from Uniprot. The label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm was activated. False discovery rates for PSM, protein and site were each set at 1%. The LFQ minimum ratio count was set at 1. MS/MS was required for LFQ comparisons. The match between runs function was activated. Protein quantifications were performed using unique and razor peptides, modified with oxidation (M) or acetyl (protein N-terminal) with a minimum ratio count of 2. Reversed sequences as decoys and contaminant sequences have been added automatically by MaxQuant. The results from MaxQuant were entered into Perseus (v 1.5.4.1) [28] where data was filtered and Log2 transformed. The protein amount in a sample was calculated from the means of two technical replicates based on the normalized peptide intensities belonging to the specific protein group. The fold-changes of protein groups were calculated by taking the mean in the ID group divided by the mean in the non-IE group. The analysis was performed in steps requiring the proteins to be detected in at least 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% of the samples. P-values were calculated by a two-tailed t-test without further correction in order not to increase the type 2 error with the risk of overlooking putative markers.  All raw data are labelled with sample number idenifier and replicate number (01/02). Case and control IDs are supplied in pdf format containing the two groups. Database search output using Maxquant are supplied as zipped "txt" output folder.
