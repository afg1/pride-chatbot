### Title
Proteomic changes of whey proteins after heating at different temperatures

### Description
This study was conducted in order to relatively quantify the changes in the native protein profile of whey after heating milk at 65 °C, 70°C, 75°C, 80°C, 85°C for 30 min

### Sample Protocol
Skimmed bovine milk was heated at 65 °C, 70°C, 75°C, 80°C, 85°C for 30 min. The pH of heated milk was adjusted to 4.6 and then centrifuged at 100.000 *g for 90 min to remove the casein and denatured whey proteins. The native whey protein samples obtained were prepared for proteomics measurements by FASP and measured by nLC-MSMS with a Proxeon Easy nLC II and LTQ-Orbitrap XL.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (1.6.0.1) with Andromeda search engine was used for identification and relative quantitation.

### Publication Abstract
Hereby we provide data from a shot-gun proteomics experiment, using filtered-aided sample preparation (FASP), and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), to relatively quantify the changes in the protein profile of whey proteins after heating milk at either 65&#xa0;&#xb0;C, 70&#xa0;&#xb0;C, 75&#xa0;&#xb0;C, 80&#xa0;&#xb0;C, or 85&#xa0;&#xb0;C for 30 min. The data supplied in this article supports the accompanying publication [1]. The raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier "PXD016436".
