### Title
Social isolation stress-resilient rats reveal energy metabolic shift in hippocampal nonsynaptic mitochondria

### Description
We investigated the relative quantification of proteins in hippocampal cytosolic and nonsynaptic mitochondrial (NSM) fractions of rats exposed to chronic social isolation (CSIS), an animal model of depression, comparing CSIS-resilient with CSIS-sensitive or control rats, via a comparative subproteomic study. Our aim was to characterize the subproteome changes representing potential long-term changes in protein expression underlying the aforementioned conditions.

### Sample Protocol
The cytosolic and non-synaptic mitochondrial fractions of the control and CSIS underwent rats samples were pooled so that each sample contained the same amount of total protein, which was then heated to 95���������������C for 5���������min and cooled on ice prior to loading onto NuPAGE 4���������12% Bis-Tris Gels (life technologies). SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to the manufacturer's specification. Proteins were fixed within the polyacrylamide matrix by incubating the entire gel in 5% acetic acid in 1:1 (v/v) water:methanol for 30���������min. After Coomassie staining (60���������min), the gel slab was rinsed with water (60���������min) and each lane was excised, divided into 3 gel fragments (samples) and cut into small pieces. The proteins were then in-gel destained (100���������mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile 1:1 (v/v)), reduced (10���������mM DTT), alkylated (50���������mm Iodoacetamide) and finally Trypsin-digested by overnight incubation at 37���������������C. The generated peptides were collected from the gel pieces, which were further subjected to a peptide extraction step with an acidic (1.5% formic acid) acetonitrile (66%) solution. Both peptide containing samples were combined and dried down in a vacuum centrifuge. Dried peptides were re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a C18 precolumn (Acclaim; Dionex) using a RSLC nano HPLC system (Dionex). Peptides were then eluted with an aqueous-organic gradient, resolved on a C18 column (Acclaim; Dionex) with a flow rate of 300���������nl/min and electrosprayed into a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A Triversa Automate (Advion biosciences) was used as an ion source. Each scan cycle consisted of one FTMS full scan and up to seven ITMS dependent MS/MS scans of the seven most intense ions. Dynamic exclusion (30s), mass width (10���������ppm) and monoisotopic precursor selection were enabled. All analyses were performed in positive ion mode.

### Data Protocol
Extracted MS/MS spectra were searched against the Uniprot database using the Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3) search engine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) accepting common variable modifications and one missed tryptic cleavage. Peptide tolerance was ������10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance was ������0.5 Da. All protein identification experiments were carried out using the corresponding decoy database and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The relative quantification of the proteins in the three subgroups was performed with the label free quantification (LFQ) tool of the Sieve 2.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a mass error tolerance of ������10ppm und a retention time shift of ������1min. Proteins identified by only one (unique) peptide match were excluded from bioinformatic analysis.
