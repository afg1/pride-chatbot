### Title
Lung Adenocarcinoma (A549) Immunopeptidomics

### Description
Alterations in cellular antigen processing and presenting machinery has gained increased interest as a hallmark of cancer-related inflammation. Growing evidence suggest that proteasome composition and immunoproteasome expression can influence antigen processing. By performing immunopeptidomics on A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line following depletion of proteasome regulator PSME4 we identified alterations in the antigenic landscape resulting from changes in proteasome processing.

### Sample Protocol
Immmunopeptidomics was performed as described [PMID: 32060274]

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.0.16) with the default parameters for the analysis of proteins and peptides (LFQ) minimum ratio count of 1, minimum peptide length for unspecific search of 6, maximum peptide length for unspecific search of 40, peptide FDR was set to 0.01 and match between runs enabled. Masses were searched against the human proteome database from UniprotKB
