### Title
Circadian rhythms study of the unicellular algae Ostreococcus tauri by shotgun proteomics

### Description
The overall set of experiments consist of sampling a culture of  the unicellular algae Ostreococcus tauri (wild type) every 4 hours over a period of 24h (6 time points). Each time point was performed with 5 replicate culture flasks, the cultures were grown under a 12:12 hour cycle (light:dark).

### Sample Protocol
Prior to trypsin digestion, samples were normalised by protein concentration. For each sample, a trypsin solution digestion in 2M urea was performed and the digests were cleaned on SPE reverse phase columns. Approximately 500ug of clean peptide digest was used for phosphopeptide enrichment using titanium dioxide spin columns.  The LC-MS analysis was performed on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL for both the global peptide extracts and the phosphopeptide enrichment fractions.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched using Mascot and quantitation was performed using an intensity based label-free approach (Progenesis).  The phosphopeptide site assignment was performed using MaxQuant. Different instances of a same phosphorylation site were merged using QPmerge  for quantitation (those data are not in PRIDE but in the supplemental information table of the manuscript; QPmerge is a recently developed in-house tool, manuscript in preparation).
