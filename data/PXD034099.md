### Title
Rumen microbiome and effect of monensin

### Description
The time-resolved impact of monensin on the active rumen microbiome in a rumen-simulating technique (Rusitec) was studied with metaproteomic and metabolomic approaches. Upon monensin treatment, decreased catabolism linked to fiber degradation was observed by the reduced abundance of proteins assigned to fibrolytic bacteria and glycoside hydrolases, sugar transporters and carbohydrate metabolism. Reduced amounts of ammonium as well as branched-chain fatty acids pointed towards a decreased proteolytic activity. The family Prevotellaceae exhibited increased resilience in the presence of monensin, with a switch of metabolism from acetate to succinate production. Prevotella species harbor a membrane bound electron transfer complex, which drives the reduction of fumarate to succinate, the substrate for propionate production in the rumen habitat. Besides the increased succinate production, a concomitant depletion of methane concentration was observed upon monensin exposure. Our study demonstrates that Prevotella sp. shifts its metabolism successfully in response to monensin exposure and Prevotellaceae represents the key bacterial family stabilizing the rumen microbiota during exposure to monensin.

### Sample Protocol
Solid sample material from nylon bags were retrieved in triplicates for both groups (CON, MON) at selected time points (7, 8, 11, 14, and 17 d), while time point 0 d was a unique sample (fresh rumen material). A total mass of 4 g solid sample material was pooled for each treatment and time point, and incubated with 35 mL methylcellulose buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% (w/v) methylcellulose, pH 8) under 30 min rotation at 4°C and subsequent vigorous mixing. After sonicating the samples in the water bath for 1 min, they were vacuum filtrated through a 2-layered sterile cheesecloth via a strainer and washed twice with 25 mL of rinsing buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8). Samples were centrifuged (200 x g, 10 min, 4°C), and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged once again (10,000 x g, 15 min, 4°C). Obtained pellets were washed twice with 5 mL wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 g/L chloramphenicol, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.5). Pellets were stored at -20°C until protein extraction. Protein extraction and purification was performed as described by Trautmann, A., et al. (2021) and modified by adapting the amount of precipitated protein to 80 µg. Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS experiments were performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled to a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) equipped using a NanosprayFlex source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) in the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany. Tryptic digested peptides were directly injected to a NanoEase analytical column (NanoEase M/Z HSS C18 T3, 1.8 µm 100 Å 75 µm x 250 mm column, Waters GmbH, Germany) operated on a constant temperature of 35°C by a PRSO-V2 column oven (Sonation GmbH, German) and a flow of 250 nL/min. A gradient with solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) was run for 140 min (0-115-130-140 min) with increasing solvent B (1-50-56-95%). The Orbitrap of the Q-Exactive HF enabled a resolution of 60,000 with a range from 200 to 2000 m/z and a TopN of 20. Tandem MS spectra were generated for the 20 most abundant peptide precursors using high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a resolution of 15,000, normalized by a collision energy of 27. Lock-mass ions from the ambient air were used for internal calibration.

### Data Protocol
Obtained tandem mass spectra from selected time points (7, 8, 11, 14, and 17 d) of CON and MON were analyzed by Metalab (v.2.1.1.7). Default settings were used to obtain label-free quantification (LFQ) values of proteins. Protein identification based on a freely available rumen metagenomic database (Stewart, R.D. et al. Nature Biotechnology 2019, 37, 953-961).

### Publication Abstract
The time-resolved impact of monensin on the active rumen microbiome was studied in a rumen-simulating technique (Rusitec) with metaproteomic and metabolomic approaches. Monensin treatment caused a decreased fibre&#xa0;degradation potential that was observed by the reduced abundance of proteins assigned to fibrolytic bacteria and glycoside hydrolases, sugar transporters and carbohydrate metabolism. Decreased proteolytic activities resulted in reduced amounts of ammonium as well as branched-chain fatty acids. The family Prevotellaceae exhibited increased resilience in the presence of monensin, with a switch of the metabolism from acetate to succinate production. Prevotella species harbour a membrane-bound electron transfer complex, which drives the reduction of fumarate to succinate, which is the substrate for propionate production in the rumen habitat. Besides the increased succinate production, a concomitant depletion of methane concentration was observed upon monensin exposure. Our study demonstrates that Prevotella sp. shifts its metabolism successfully in response to monensin exposure and Prevotellaceae represents the key bacterial family stabilizing the rumen microbiota during exposure to monensin.
