### Title
LC-MSMS of leukemic cell line K562

### Description
Comparative label free quantitative proteomic analysis using SWATH-MS has been carried out for K562 cells treated with Imatinib (S+IM) against untreated K562 (S) as well as imatinib resistant K562 cells (R). Compariosn of S+IM vs R constitutes Dataset 1 while that of S vs S+IM constitutes dataset 2

### Sample Protocol
The whole cell lysate was subjected to reduction, alkylation and in-solution trypsin digestion. Peptides were desalted using C-18 spin tips before injecting into LC.

### Data Protocol
The IDA runs were pooled and analyzed in Protein Pilot software v4.5 (Sciex, USA) with paragon algorithm, to generate spectral ion library.Spectral alignment and targeted data extraction of the swath runs were carried out in Peak View 2.2 software using MS/MSALL with SWATH acquisition microapp (Sciex, USA). Marker View software v 1.3 (Sciex, USA) was used for quantification.
