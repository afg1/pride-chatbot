### Title
Deep proteome analysis of Leishmania major Friedlin

### Description
Deep proteome analysis to assess the impact of FUT1 and LPG on the L. major Friedlin proteome

### Sample Protocol
in-solution digestions Basic reverse phase fractionation of multiple biological replicates

### Data Protocol
Data was searched using Maxquant version 1.6.3.4 against the Leishmania major MHOM and TriLeishmania major Friedlin (TrypDB 37) proteomes using trypsin specifcity, up to 2 misscleavage events and allowing oxidation of Methionine. Matching between runs and LFQ based quantification was enabled.
