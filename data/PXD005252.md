### Title
Time-resolved analysis reveals rapid dynamics and broad scope of the CBP/p300 acetylome

### Description
The acetyltransferases CBP and p300 are multifunctional transcriptional co-activators; however, their acetylation targets, site-specific acetylation kinetics, and function in proteome regulation are incompletely understood. We combined quantitative proteomics with novel CBP/p300-specific catalytic inhibitors, bromodomain inhibitor, and gene knockout to show that CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites, as well as a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Kinetic analysis identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (<30min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation. Collectively, our in-depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attributes of CBP/p300 targets, and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP/p300 functions, as well as for understanding the impact of small molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were digested to peptides using stadard protocols. Peptides were fractionated by high PH reverse-phase chromatography for proteome determination and for some acetylated peptide enrichment. Acetylated peptides were enriched with PTM scan acetyllysine enrichment kit from Cell Signaling Technologies. Some acetylated peptides were fractionated by micro-scale SCX following enrichment.Details are provided in the supplementary tables.

### Data Protocol
Peptide fractions were analyzed by online nanoflow LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon easy nLC system connected to an Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), as described (Kelstrup et al, 2014). Raw data was computationally processed using MaxQuant (developer version 1.5.5.4) and searched against the UniProt database (downloaded July 6, 2015) using the integrated Andromeda search engine (http://www.maxquant.org/) (Cox et al, 2011). The acetyl (K) sites table was filtered to remove reverse entries, contaminant entries, and entries with localization probability less than 90% (0.9). Identified sites required a minimum Andromeda search score of 40. Protein quantification required a minimum of 2 peptides, 1 unique peptide, and 2 ratios counts; reverse, contaminant, and proteins only identified by a modification site were removed.

### Publication Abstract
The acetyltransferases CBP and p300 are multifunctional transcriptional co-activators. Here, we combined quantitative proteomics with CBP/p300-specific catalytic inhibitors, bromodomain inhibitor, and gene knockout to reveal a comprehensive map of regulated acetylation sites and their dynamic turnover rates. CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites and a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Time-resolved acetylome analyses identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (&lt;30&#xa0;min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation. Collectively, our in-depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attributes of CBP/p300 targets, and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP/p300 functions and for understanding the impact of small-molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities.
