### Title
LysargiNase and tryptic digest of MDA-MB 231 cell lysates

### Description
Comparison of peptide properties in proteomes digested with LysargiNase in comparison to trypsin

### Sample Protocol
cell lysates were prepared from 2 biological replicates in presence of protease inhibitors. Proteins were purified by chloroform/methanol precipitation, denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested in 2 technical replicates each.

### Data Protocol
Spectrum to sequence matching with MaxQuant 1.4.12, first all files analysed combined without constraint by enzyme specificity (search limited to peptides up to 25 aa in length) to define cleavage specificity rules. Followed by second search using newly defined enzyme rules [X|KR] for LysargiNase and [KR|X] for trypsin

### Publication Abstract
To improve proteome coverage and protein C-terminal identification, we characterized the Methanosarcina acetivorans thermophilic proteinase LysargiNase, which cleaves before lysine and arginine up to 55 &#xb0;C. Unlike trypsin, LysargiNase-generated peptides had N-terminal lysine or arginine residues and fragmented with b ion-dominated spectra. This improved protein C terminal-peptide identification and several arginine-rich phosphosite assignments. Notably, cleavage also occurred at methylated or dimethylated lysine and arginine, facilitating detection of these epigenetic modifications.
