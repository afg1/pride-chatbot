### Title
An affinity switch controls hierarchical Type III protein targeting and secretion

### Description
Surface proteolysis of EPEC IMVs, before and after urea treatment

### Sample Protocol
IMVs preparation, surface proteolysis in-solution, desalting, LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30 for the identification of peptides. Spectra were searched against EPEC E2348/69 strain using 1% peptide and protein FDR. Proteins were quantified based on the summed peptide intensities.

### Publication Abstract
Type III secretion (T3S), a protein export pathway common to Gram-negative pathogens, comprises a trans-envelope syringe, the injectisome, with a cytoplasm-facing translocase channel. Exported substrates are chaperone-delivered to the translocase, EscV in enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli,</i> and cross it in strict hierarchical manner, for example, first "translocators", then "effectors". We dissected T3S substrate targeting and hierarchical switching by reconstituting them <i>in&#xa0;vitro</i> using inverted inner membrane vesicles. EscV recruits and conformationally activates the tightly membrane-associated pseudo-effector SepL and its chaperone SepD. This renders SepL a high-affinity receptor for translocator/chaperone pairs, recognizing specific chaperone signals. In a second, SepD-coupled step, translocators docked on SepL become secreted. During translocator secretion, SepL/SepD suppress effector/chaperone binding to EscV and prevent premature effector secretion. Disengagement of the SepL/SepD switch directs EscV to dedicated effector export. These findings advance molecular understanding of T3S and reveal a novel mechanism for hierarchical trafficking regulation in protein secretion channels.
