### Title
Biomarker discovery for Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease using serum-derived extracellular vesicles

### Description
Serum extracellular vesicles were obtained from Tasmanian devils with confirmed DFTD, heathy devils from captive and wild populations and from latent devils with no evidence of facial tumours.

### Sample Protocol
EV's were purified by size exclusion chromatography and protein extracts prepared by lysis in acetonitrile.  Proteins were quantified and 30ug aliquots used for digestion according to the SP3 method.  A pooled sample was fractionated and used for library generation by DDA-MS while individual samples were analysed by DIA-MS.  Both deployed 90 minute gradients on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to an RSLCnano HPLC.

### Data Protocol
Spectronaut v13 and Perseus software was used for protein identification and relative quantitation, while most statistical tests were done using RStudio.
