### Title
endogenous TBK1-mediated GABARAP-L2 and LC3C phosphorylation site identification

### Description
In order to identify TBK1-mediated GABARAP-L2 and LC3C phosphorylation sites, cells were treated with TBK1 or control siRNA and TBK1 kinase activity was induced by treatment with CCCP.

### Sample Protocol
GFP-GABARAP-L2 and GFP-LC3C were transfected into siRNA (control or TBK1) treated HEK293T cells and GFP immunoprecipitated.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 software with FDR 1%, 1% PSM and 1% site decoy level.
