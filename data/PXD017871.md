### Title
012819 Hawse phospho Tyrosine dataset

### Description
In order to determine early signaling in T-cell activations we have profiled proteins that contain phosphorylated Tyrosine residues.

### Sample Protocol
Activated murine T-cells were lysed and then an immunoprecipitated using a phospho-Tyrosine antobody. Proteins that were enriched were digested using a modified-FASP protocol and analyzed on a Thermo QExactive MS.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched against mouse Uniprot database using PEAKS studio 10.0. Further processing was performed on raw quantitation.

### Publication Abstract
None
