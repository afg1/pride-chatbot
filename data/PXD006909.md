### Title
LRRK2 signalling pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

### Description
LRRK2 promotes Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance by regulating phagosome maturation in mouse macrophages

### Sample Protocol
BMDMs LRRK2 WT and KO, Phagosomes enrichment and dimethyl labelling prior LCMSMS analysis Raw Wt and HG, Phosphoproteomic analysis of phagosomal phosphoproteome using latex beads using HG-10-102-01 inhibitor rubicon Ip from phagosomal enrcihment and analysis of the IP by LC-MSMS

### Data Protocol
All data were processed using the MaxQuant server and Andromeda search engine with the mouse uniprot database (without isoforms)

### Publication Abstract
Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with Parkinson's disease, chronic inflammation and mycobacterial infections. Although there is evidence supporting the idea that LRRK2 has an immune function, the cellular function of this kinase is still largely unknown. By using genetic, pharmacological and proteomics approaches, we show that LRRK2 kinase activity negatively regulates phagosome maturation via the recruitment of the Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex and Rubicon to the phagosome in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity in mouse and human macrophages enhanced <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> phagosome maturation and mycobacterial control independently of autophagy. <i>In vivo</i>, LRRK2 deficiency in mice resulted in a significant decrease in <i>M.&#xa0;tuberculosis</i> burdens early during the infection. Collectively, our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining genetic evidence linking LRRK2 to mycobacterial diseases and establish an LRRK2-dependent cellular pathway that controls <i>M.&#xa0;tuberculosis</i> replication by regulating phagosome maturation.
