### Title
A novel domain essential for interdomain cooperativity in binding of a Rep protein to DNA.

### Description
A very important feature of replication initiation proteins is the ability to bind to DNA via a characteristic domain. Usually, one or two DNA-binding domains can be distinguished within each initiator. In this work, we specified a new family of replication initiation proteins (the TrfA-like protein family) with unique domain compositions that are important for interactions with DNA. Using phylogenetic analysis and structure prediction methods simultaneously with biochemical assays, we demonstrate that in the replication initiator of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2, in addition to two winged helix domains, a third domain that interacts with DNA can be described. Mass spectrometric analysis followed by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro and in vivo analysis of TrfA variants showed that DNA binding by all three domains of TrfA is important for stable nucleoprotein complex formation and the replication activity of the initiator.

### Sample Protocol
The UV crosslinking reaction mixtures contained 1 µM annealed DNA with the internal modification 5 Br dU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (Thermo Scientific)), 56 µM TrfA, 40 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM ATP, and 11 mM magnesium acetate. The mixtures were assembled on ice, followed by incubation at 32 °C for 0.5 h. UV irradiation was performed at 120000 µJ/cm2 in a crosslinker (CL-1000 UV crosslinker, UVP, USA; 302 nm lamp), and then, the reaction mixtures were precipitated with ethanol. The samples were mixed with CHCA matrix dissolved in 50% ACN with 0.1% TFA and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF with an MALDI TOF/TOF 5800 mass spectrometer (Sciex).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectroemtry data were processed with Data Explorer and Protein Pilot software (Sciex).

### Publication Abstract
An essential feature of replication initiation proteins is their ability to bind to DNA. In this work, we describe a new domain that contributes to a replication initiator sequence-specific interaction with DNA. Applying biochemical assays and structure prediction methods coupled with DNA-protein crosslinking, mass spectrometry, and construction and analysis of mutant proteins, we identified that the replication initiator of the broad host range plasmid RK2, in addition to two winged helix domains, contains a third DNA-binding domain. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the composition of this unique domain is typical within the described TrfA-like protein family. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments involving the constructed TrfA mutant proteins showed that the newly identified domain is essential for the formation of the protein complex with DNA, contributes to the avidity for interaction with DNA, and the replication activity of the initiator. The analysis of mutant proteins, each containing a single substitution, showed that each of the three domains composing TrfA is essential for the formation of the protein complex with DNA. Furthermore, the new domain, along with the winged helix domains, contributes to the sequence specificity of replication initiator interaction within the plasmid replication origin.
