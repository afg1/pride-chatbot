### Title
SILAC of HepG2 or HepAD38 cell lines with HBV

### Description
Hepatitis B Virus constitutes a major threat to global public health by infecting hepatocytes, initiating and driving the progress to end-stage liver disease and liver cancer. Curing treatment for HBV infection is yet unavailable, mainly due to unmet gaps in current understanding of HBV-host interaction. Here, multi-omics interrogations were conducted to generate the first landscape of HBV-induced global changes in host transcriptome, translatome and proteome, which identified multiple translatomic events that HBV orchestrated to remodel host proteostasis networks and afford micro-environments essential for HBV proliferation and persistence.

### Sample Protocol
HepG2 or HepAD38 cell lines were passaged at 80% confluence in heavy (L‐lysine‐2HCL(13C6 15N2, 98% isotopic purity) and L –arginine‐HCL(13C6 15N4, 98% )), middle (L‐lysine‐2HCL (4,4,5,5 D4, 98%) and L –arginine‐HCL(13C6, 98%)) or light (normal) SILAC media. Cells were grown to confluence and passaged, still in heavy, middle or light medium for ten passages. Cells were collected at the 4th, 8th, or 10th for determination of labeling efficiency, when it reached 95%, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for three times, and then lysed with SDT buffer (2% SDS(w/v)，0.1M DTT，0.1M Tris，pH 7.6), cell lysates were collected and boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 15000g for 15 minutes, the supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. Before mass spectrometry analysis, Proteins in each cell lysate were quantitated by gel-electrophoresis and coomassie brilliant blue staining, and imagJ analysis, and 20μg from heavy, middle and light conditions were mixed together and then subjected to mass spectrometry at Beijing Proteome Research Center, BPRC.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched using the Maxquant search engine37 with two sequence databases, respectively, including normal human protein sequence from Uniprot and protein sequence of non-canonical ORFs from RiboCode.
