### Title
Streptococcus suis SC-19, LC-MSMS

### Description
Phosphoproteomic analysis to identify deregulated phosphoproteins in stk mutant strain compared to the parental wild type strain SC-19

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction, digestion, labeling with iTRAQ reagents and phosphopeptides enrichment,LC-MC/MS analysis,Phosphoproteomic data analysis

### Data Protocol
For peptides after phosphopeptides enrichment, the following options were used. Peptide mass tolerance: ± 20ppm, MS/MS tolerance: 0.1 Da, enzyme: trypsin, max missed cleavages: 2, fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ8plex (K) and iTRAQ8plex (N-term), variable modifications: oxidation (M), phosphorylation (Ser/Thr/Tyr). For peptide identification, false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated and the threshold was set to 1%. The peptides were determined as true phosphorylation based on the following criteria: Phospho RS score > 50 and Phospho RS site probabilities > 75%. To evaluate the differentially exressed phosphoproteins between Δstk and SC-19, FC > 1.2 and < 0.83 were used to represent up- or down regulation, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
Like eukaryotes, bacteria express one or more serine/threonine kinases (STKs) that initiate diverse signaling networks. The STK from <i>Streptococcus suis</i> is encoded by a single-copy <i>stk</i> gene, which is crucial in stress response and virulence. To further understand the regulatory mechanism of STK in <i>S. suis</i>, a <i>stk</i> deletion strain (&#x394;<i>stk</i>) and its complementary strain (C&#x394;<i>stk</i>) were constructed to systematically decode STK characteristics by applying whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and phosphoproteomic analysis. Numerous genes were differentially expressed in &#x394;<i>stk</i> compared with the wild-type parental strain SC-19, including 320 up-regulated and 219 down-regulated genes. Particularly, 32 virulence-associated genes (VAGs) were significantly down-regulated in &#x394;<i>stk</i>. Seven metabolic pathways relevant to bacterial central metabolism and translation are significantly repressed in &#x394;<i>stk</i>. Phosphoproteomic analysis further identified 12 phosphoproteins that exhibit differential phosphorylation in &#x394;<i>stk</i>. These proteins are associated with cell growth and division, glycolysis, and translation. Consistently, phenotypic assays confirmed that the &#x394;<i>stk</i> strain displayed deficient growth and attenuated pathogenicity. Thus, STK is a central regulator that plays an important role in cell growth and division, as well as <i>S. suis</i> metabolism.
