### Title
Optimisation of a protocol for Protein Extraction from Calcified Aortic Valves for Proteomics Applications

### Description
The comprehension of the pathophysiological mechanisms, the identification of druggable targets, and putative biomarkers for aortic valve stenosis can be pursued through holistic approaches such as proteomics. However, tissue homogenisation and protein extraction are difficulted by tissue calcification. Reproducibility of proteome studies is key when minding clinical translation of the findings. Thus, we aimed to optimise a protocol for aortic valve homogenisation and protein extraction, and to develop a standard operating procedure (SOP), which can be used by researchers to maximise protein yield, while reducing inter-laboratory variability. We have compared the protein yield between conventional tissue grinding in nitrogen followed by homogenisation with a Potter apparatus, with a more advanced bead-beating system. Once confirmed the superiority of the latter, we further optimised it by testing the effect of beads size, the number of homogenisation cycles, tube capacity, lysis buffer/tissue mass ratio, and two different lysis buffers. Optimal protein extraction was achieved with 2.8 mm zirconium dioxide beads, in two homogenisation cycles, in the presence of 20 µL RIPA buffer/mg tissue, using 2-mL O-ring tubes. As a proof-of-concept of the usefulness of this SOP for proteomics, the AV proteome of men and women with aortic stenosis was characterised, resulting in the quantification of proteins across 6 orders of magnitude, and uncovering some putative proteins dysregulated by sex.

### Sample Protocol
The aortic valves were processed following a standard operating procedure. 32±2 mg of tissue was grossly fragmented in liquid nitrogen and quickly transferred to a 2-mL O-ring tube filled with 1.2g of 2.8mm zirconium dioxide beads. Cold (4 °C) RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS; 89900, Thermo Fisher Scientific), enriched with 1 mM EDTA (1084540100, Merck - Millipore), protease (Halt PIC, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and phosphatase inhibitor (PhosStop, Roche) cocktails were added at a ratio of 10 µL/mg tissue. The tissue was homogenised in two cycles of bead-beating at 5,000 rpm, for 30 minutes, with a 5-minutes interval on ice. The lysate was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (13,680 x g) for 15 minutes at 4 °C, and the supernatant stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the DC method (BioRad Laboratories). Protein extracts from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE for about 19 minutes at 110 V (Short-GeLC approach) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. For protein identification [data-dependent acquisition (DDA)], 60 μg of protein were loaded into the gel and each lane was divided into 5 fractions. For SWATH experiments [data-independent acquisition (DIA)], 40 μg of protein were loaded and each lane was divided into three fractions. Gel bands were distained using a 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 30% acetonitrile solution followed by overnight protein digestion with trypsin. Peptide extraction from the gel was performed by incubation with solutions containing different percentages of acetonitrile (30, 50, and 98%) with 1% of formic acid. For protein identification, each fraction was analysed separately and for protein quantification, fractions from each sample were joined and a single analysis per sample was performed by LC-MS/MS. Samples were analysed on a NanoLC™ 425 System (Eksigent) coupled to a Triple TOF™ 6600 mass spectrometer (Sciex) and the ionisation source (ESI DuoSpray™ Source). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Triart C18 Capillary Column 1/32" (12 nm, S-3μm, 150 x 0.3 mm, YMC) and using a Triart C18 Capillary Guard Column (0.5 × 5 mm, 3 μm, 12nm, YMC) at 50°C. The flow rate was set to 5 μL/min and mobile phases A and B were 5% DMSO plus 0.1% formic acid in water and 5% DMSO plus 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, respectively. The LC program was performed as followed: 5 – 30% of B (0 - 50 min), 30 – 98% of B (50 - 52 min), 98% of B (52 - 54 min), 98 - 5% of B (54 - 56 min), and 5% of B (56 - 65 min). The ionisation source was operated in the positive mode set to an ion spray voltage of 5500 V, 25 psi for nebulizer gas 1 (GS1), 10 psi for nebulizer gas 2 (GS2), 25 psi for the curtain gas (CUR), and source temperature (TEM) at 100°C. For data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments, the mass spectrometer was set to scanning full spectra (m/z 350-2250) for 250 ms, followed by up to 100 MS/MS scans (m/z 100 – 1500). Candidate ions with a charge state between +1 and +5 and counts above a minimum threshold of 10 counts per second were isolated for fragmentation, and one MS/MS spectrum was collected before adding those ions to the exclusion list for 15 seconds (mass spectrometer operated by Analyst® TF 1.8.1, Sciex®). The rolling collision energy was used with a collision energy spread of 5. For SWATH experiments, the mass spectrometer was operated in a looped product ion mode and specifically tuned to a set of 42 overlapping windows, covering the precursor mass range of 350-1400 m/z. A 50 ms survey scan (350-2250 m/z) was acquired at the beginning of each cycle, and SWATH-MS/MS spectra were collected from 100-2250 m/z for 50 ms resulting in a cycle time of 2.2 seconds.

### Data Protocol
A specific ion-library of the precursor masses and fragment ions was created by combining all files from the pools in one protein identification search using the ProteinPilot™ software (v5.0, Sciex). The paragon method parameters were the following: searched against the reviewed Human (SwissProt) database, cysteine alkylation by acrylamide, digestion by trypsin, and gel-based ID. An independent False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis, using the target-decoy approach provided by Protein Pilot™, was used to assess the quality of identifications. SWATH data processing was performed using SWATHTM processing plug-in for PeakViewTM (v2.0.01, Sciex®). Protein relative quantification was performed in all samples using the information from the protein identification search. Quantification results were obtained for peptides with less than 1% of FDR for at least one of the samples by performing the sum of up to 5 fragments/peptide. Peptide relative peak areas were normalised for the total sum of areas for the respective sample, and protein quantities were obtained by the sum of up to 15 peptides/protein.
