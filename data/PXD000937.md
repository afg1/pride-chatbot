### Title
Mariprofundus ferroooxydans PV-1 osmotic shock vs extraction with NaOH LC-MSMS

### Description
Proteomic analysis was performed on protein extracts of M. ferrooxydans by following two methodologies: osmotic shock and alkalyne lysis (extraction with NaOH).

### Sample Protocol
A total of 8 liters of M.ferrooxydans PV-1 was harvested on 0.22 um filters and treated for osmotic-shock per Neu and Heppel (1965).  For the alkaline lysis protocol (crude extract), of a total 8 L of M. ferrooxydans PV-1 was harvested on 0.22 um filters and immersed in a total of 80 mL 0.1 N NaOH. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels.

### Data Protocol
Excised bands were trypsin-digested and submitted for LC-MS/MS analysis a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer equipped with an Eksigent Nanoliquid Chromatography 1-D plus system. The resulting MS/MS spectra were searched against the proteome of Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1 in the Uniprot database using the Proteome Discoverer SEQUEST Daemon search engine.
