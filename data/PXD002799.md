### Title
Nuclear proteomics in acute myeloid leukemia

### Description
The protein differences betweeen primary patient material from AML sufferers and normals was analysed using shotgun proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
AML cell pellets were lysed, trypsinised and iTRAQ labelled before being fractionated using basic pH reverse phase chromatography. Each of the collected fractions were then further fractionated using acidic pH reverse phase chromatography online to allow mass spectrometric analysis.

### Data Protocol
For the data acquired on the Orbitrap Velos were analysed using the Proteome Discoverer 3. Data was also acquired using the 5600 Triple ToF mass spectrometer, this data was analysed using Proteinpilot 4.
