### Title
LC-MS/MS of an unidentified extracellular protein of Edwardsiella piscicida

### Description
This assay aims to identify the composition of an unidentified protein band (~10 kDa) in Edwardsiella piscicida’s extracellular proteins (ECPs). To make this end, this protein band was cut, followed by gel band excision and LC-MS/MS identification.

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, the protein band was cut and destained. After destaining, the gel pieces were digested with trypsin at 37°C overnight. LC-MS/MS analyses of peptides were performed with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer based on higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometric data were analyzed using the Mascot 2.2 software (Matrix Science, UK) against proteins of Edwardsiella piscicida for database search.
