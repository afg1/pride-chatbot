### Title
Human TRIM72 localizes on the microsome

### Description
Membrane repair machinery is a unique process to maintain cell integrity. In the early step of repair process, TRIM72 facilitates the patch membranes to damaged sites for resealing membrane and protects cells from acute membrane injury. The TRIM72 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily. Not only the repair machinery, the TRIM72 is also known as targeting membrane proteins such as insulin substrate receptor-1 (IRS-1) and insulin receptor (IR), so membrane binding events would be essential for TRIM72 to play a role. We found that the human TRIM72 localizes on the microsomal vesicles with very strong affinity. By the mass spectrometric gene ontology analysis, it has been confirmed the microsomal fractions were originated from the junctional and the exocytic vesicles. Moreover, identified proteins are classified to the cell adhesion and cell adhesion molecule binding. These results suggest that the cellular activity of TRIM72 would be related to vesicular proteins which engage to cell adhesion and furthermore, it should be mediated after membrane trans-localization of TRIM72.

### Sample Protocol
Human TRIM72 with N-terminal 2xStrep-tag was overexpressed in HEK293T cells by transfection with polyethyleneimine. After 48 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP. After lysis by an ultrasonic probe and centrifugation (17,000 xg, 4 °C for 1 h), the supernatants were loaded onto the streptactin-immobilized column. The protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin, and next applied to the size exclusion chromatography using SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL. The TRIM72 and microsome containing fraction was conducted to mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
The MS derived data were searched against the human entries in the UniProt database through Proteome Discoverer platform (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Scientiﬁc). The search parameters for SEQUEST algorithm included: carbamidomethylation of cysteine as ﬁxed modiﬁcations; oxidation of methionine as variable modiﬁcations; precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm; and fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da.

### Publication Abstract
Defects in plasma membrane repair can lead to muscle and heart diseases in humans. Tripartite motif-containing protein (TRIM)72 (mitsugumin 53; MG53) has been determined to rapidly nucleate vesicles at the site of membrane damage, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we present the structure of Mus musculus TRIM72, a complete model of a TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrated that the interaction between TRIM72 and phosphatidylserine-enriched membranes is necessary for its oligomeric assembly and ubiquitination activity. Using cryogenic electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, we elucidated a higher-order model of TRIM72 assembly on the phospholipid bilayer. Combining structural and biochemical techniques, we developed a working molecular model of TRIM72, providing insights into the regulation of RING-type E3 ligases through the cooperation of multiple domains in higher-order assemblies. Our findings establish a fundamental basis for the study of TRIM E3 ligases and have therapeutic implications for diseases associated with membrane repair.
