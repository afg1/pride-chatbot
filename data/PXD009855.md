### Title
MTA proteins act redundantly within the NuRD complex to ensure fidelity of ES cell lineage commitment

### Description
Multiprotein chromatin remodelling complexes show remarkable conservation of function amongst metazoans, even though each component present in invertebrates are often present as multiple paralogous proteins in vertebrate complexes. In some cases these paralogues have been shown to specify distinct biochemical and/or functional activities in vertebrate cells. Here we set out to define the biochemical and functional diversity encoded by one such group of proteins within the mammalian Nucleosome Remodelling and Deaceylation (NuRD) complex: Mta1, Mta2 and Mta3. We find that, in contrast to what has been described in somatic cells, MTA proteins are not mutually exclusive within ES cell NuRD and, despite subtle differences in chromatin binding and biochemical interactions, serve largely redundant functions. Nevertheless, ES cells lacking all three MTA proteins represent a complete NuRD null and are viable, allowing us to identify a previously undetected function for NuRD in maintaining differentiation trajectory during early stages of lineage commitment.

### Sample Protocol
Label-free GFP pulldowns were performed in triplicate as previously described (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389936).  2 mg of nuclear extract was incubated with 7.5 μl GFP-Trap beads (Chromotek) or 15 μl Flag-sepharose beads (Sigma) and 50 μg/mL ethidium bromide in Buffer C (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 20% v/v glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA) with 0.1% NP-40, protease inhibitors, and 0.5 mM DTT in a total volume of 400 μl. After incubation, 6 washes were performed: 2 with Buffer C and 0.5% NP-40, 2 with PBS and 0.5% NP-40, and 2 with PBS. Affinity purified proteins were subject to on-bead trypsin digestion as previously described (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23066101). In short, beads were resuspended in 50 μl elution buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT) and incubated for 20 min in a thermoshaker at 1400 rpm at room temperature. After addition of 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), beads were incubated for 10 min at 1400 rpm at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were then on-bead digested into tryptic peptides by addition of 0.25 μg trypsin (Promega) and subsequent incubation for 2 h at 1400 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and further digested overnight at room temperature with an additional 0.1 μg of trypsin. Tryptic peptides were acidified and desalted using StageTips (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17703201) prior to mass spectrometry analyses.  Tryptic peptides were separated with an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid and Buffer B was 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were separated using a 94-min gradient from 9-32% Buffer B followed by washes at 50% then 95% Buffer B for 120 min of total data collection time. Mass spectra were recorded on an LTQ-Orbitrap QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), selecting the top 10 most intense precursor ions for fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Thermo RAW files from LFQ AP-MS/MS were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.5.1.0 using default settings and searching against the UniProt curated mouse proteome, release 2015_12. Additional options for Match between runs, LFQ, and iBAQ were selected. Stoichiometry calculations and volcano plots were produced essentially as described (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479470, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23066101) using Perseus version 1.4.0.8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27348712) and in-house R scripts. For interactor identification, t-test-based statistics are applied on label-free quantified (LFQ) mass spec data. First, the logarithm (log2) of the LFQ values is taken, resulting in a Gaussian distribution of the data. This allows imputation of missing values by normal distribution, assuming these proteins are close to the detection limit. Statistical outliers for the GFP and Flag pull-downs in both tagged and control cell lines are then determined using a two-tailed t-test. Multiple testing correction is applied by using a permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) method in Perseus.
