### Title
Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles from mouse-derived SCLC cell lines

### Description
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) tumors are made up of distinct cell subpopulations, including neuroendocrine (NE) and non-NE cells. Proteomic analysis of purified small extracellular vesicles (EV) from these two cell populations were conducted.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from NE and non-NE small EVs were digested with trypsin. Peptides were labeled with TMT reagents, combined, fractionated (MudPIT), and analyzed via LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were searched against a database containing the Mus musculus subset of the UniprotKB database using SequestHT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific). Percolator validation was performed with a 1% false discovery rate.
