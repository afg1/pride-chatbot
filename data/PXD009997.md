### Title
Characterization of AAEL012437 (Veneno)-interacting proteins.

### Description
To investigate the repertoire of proteins interacting with the Aedes aegypti TUDOR protein AAEL012437 (Veneno), we transiently expressed a GFP-Veneno transgene in Aag2 cells. These cells were either infected with the alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV) or mock-infected. Subsequently, cells were lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation using GFP-TRAP beads to purify Veneno-complexes. The same approach was followed for a truncated transgene lacking the first 205 amino acids (C206).

### Sample Protocol
Raw data files were analyzed using Maxquant version 1.5.1.0. using standard recommended settings. LFQ, IBAQ and match between runs were enabled. Data were mapped to the Aedes aegypti proteome included in the NCBI Ae. aegypti Annotation Release 101 (released 12 July 2017), to which Sindbis virus (SINV) protein sequences were added manually. Data was further analyzed and visualized using Perseus version 1.3.0.4 and R. In short, identified proteins were filtered for contaminants and reverse hits. LFQ-values were subsequently log2-transformed and missing values were imputed assuming a normal distribution. A t-test was then performed to calculate significantly enriched proteins. Volcano plots were generated with R.
