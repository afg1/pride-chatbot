### Title
Synthesizing Signaling Pathways from Temporal Phosphoproteomic Data

### Description
A quantitative time series of EGFR signaling was acquired using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to develop an algorithm that identifies signaling pathway structures.  The study used Flp-In 293 cells expressing EGFR that were stimulated with EGF.

### Sample Protocol
After EGF stimulation for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 min, cells were lysed and proteins were extracted, denatured, alkylated and trypsin digested.  Peptides were isobarically labeled, enriched using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies and/or immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and analyzed on a Velos Pro Elite mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Peptide sequences and relative quantification were determined using COMET (see details in manuscript).

### Publication Abstract
We present a method for automatically discovering signaling pathways from time-resolved phosphoproteomic data. The Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS) algorithm uses constraint-solving techniques first developed in the context of formal verification to explore paths in an interaction network. It systematically eliminates all candidate structures for a signaling pathway where a protein is activated or inactivated before its upstream regulators. The algorithm can model more than one hundred thousand dynamic phosphosites and can discover pathway members that are not differentially phosphorylated. By analyzing temporal data, TPS defines signaling cascades without needing to experimentally perturb individual proteins. It recovers known pathways and proposes pathway connections when applied to the human epidermal growth factor and yeast osmotic stress responses. Independent kinase mutant studies validate predicted substrates in the TPS osmotic stress pathway.
