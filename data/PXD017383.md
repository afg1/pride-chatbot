### Title
Identification of Xenopus laevis egg extract fraction stimulating somatic DNA replication through LC-MSMS

### Description
In several metazoans the number of active replication origins in embryonic nuclei is higher than in somatic ones, ensuring rapid genome duplication during synchronous embryonic cell divisions. High replication origin density can be restored by somatic nuclear reprogramming. However, mechanisms underlying high replication origin density formation coupled to rapid cell cycles are poorly understood. Here, we characterized a fraction of Xenopus egg extract able to stimulate somatic DNA replication.

### Sample Protocol
Fractions obtained by PEG precipitation or column elution were analysed for their ability to stimulate DNA replication. Active fractions were analysed by LC-MSMS. To this end about 50 µg of proteins were resuspended in 8M Urea 10mM Tris-HCl buffer, reduced by TCEP, alkylated by chloroacetamide, digested by Lys-C and Trypsin (1). The resulting peptides were desalted on a home-made C18 StageTip. Peptides were resuspended in 15 μl of Solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and 4 μl was injected.

### Data Protocol
For protein identification the raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fischer Scientific). MS2 spectra were searched with Mascot engine against an in house Xenopus Laevis revisioned version (according to Tikira Temu, Matthias Mann, Markus Räschle, Jürgen Cox, Homology-driven assembly of NOn-redundant protEin sequence sets (NOmESS) for mass spectrometry, Bioinformatics, Volume 32, Issue 9, 1 May 2016, Pages 1417–1419, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv756), with the following parameters: enzyme Trypsin, maximum missed cleavage 2, fixed modification carbamidomethylation (C), variable modification oxidation (M) and protein N-terminal acetylation, peptide tolerance 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance 20 mmu. Peptide Spectral Matches (PSM) were filtered using percolator based on q-values at a 0.01 FDR (high confidence). Proteins were considered identified with 2 unique high confident peptides (Käll at al. Nat. Methods, 4 (11) (2007) 923–925). Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.3.4, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A et al Anal. Chem. 2002; 74(20):5383-92) with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Al et al Anal. Chem. 2003; 75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters.

### Publication Abstract
In several metazoans, the number of active replication origins in embryonic nuclei is higher than in somatic ones, ensuring rapid genome duplication during synchronous embryonic cell divisions. High replication origin density can be restored by somatic nuclear reprogramming. However, mechanisms underlying high replication origin density formation coupled to rapid cell cycles are poorly understood. Here, using Xenopus laevis, we show that SSRP1 stimulates replication origin assembly on somatic chromatin by promoting eviction of histone H1 through its N-terminal domain. Histone H1 removal derepresses ORC and MCM chromatin binding, allowing efficient replication origin assembly. SSRP1 protein decays at mid-blastula transition (MBT) when asynchronous somatic cell cycles start. Increasing levels of SSRP1 delay MBT and, surprisingly, accelerate post-MBT cell cycle speed and embryo development. These findings identify a major epigenetic mechanism regulating DNA replication and directly linking replication origin assembly, cell cycle duration and embryo development in vertebrates.
