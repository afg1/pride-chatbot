### Title
Thermal proteome profiling on zebrafish using napabucasin

### Description
In this project we performed thermal proteome profiling experiments on zebrafish embryos with the drug napabucasin.  The lysate was heat treated, TMT labelled and subsuquently high pH fractionated.

### Sample Protocol
Zebrafish lysate was subjected to thermal proteome profiling, followed by digestion, TMT labelling and high pH fractionation. Samples were measured on a Q Exactive HF-X

### Data Protocol
Samples were processed using MaxQuant (Version 1.6.5.0) using the following parameters:digestion by trypsin/P with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. As fixed modification carbamidomethylation of cysteine was chosen, as variable modification oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were chosen. TMT 10plex labelling was chosen as MS2 reporter ions. The mass tolerance of precursor ions was chosen as ±5 ppm and the mass tolerance of MS/MS was chosen as ±20 ppm. Results were adjusted to 1% PSM and 1% FDR using a target-decoy approach using reverted protein sequences
