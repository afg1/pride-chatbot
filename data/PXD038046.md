### Title
Golgi-IP, a novel tool for multimodal analysis of Golgi molecular content

### Description
The Golgi plays an essential role in protein and lipid glycosylation. Golgi dysfunction is associated with a variety of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease. We developed a powerful immunoprecipitation technique to isolate the Golgi by tagging TMEM115. Golgi-immunoprecipitation enriched protein markers specific for the organelle with minimal contamination from other subcellular compartments. Using this technique, we characterised the Golgi proteome, metabolome and lipidome. Proteomics analysis confirmed capture of known Golgi proteins and identified additional candidates enriched in the organelle. Metabolomics analysis revealed selective enrichment of uridine-diphosphate (UDP) sugars and their derivatives and validated SLC35A2 as the subcellular transporter for UDP-hexose. Lastly, lipidomics analysis showed that phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine are the top enriched Golgi lipids. Our Golgi-IP workflow provides a paradigm for multimodal analysis of Golgi molecular content with enhanced subcellular precision.

### Sample Protocol
The GolgiTAG immunoprecipitated bead slurry is solubilized in 100 µl of lysis buffer (2% SDS in 100mM HEPES pH8.0, Protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Both the Immunoprecipitates and whole-cell extracts were processed using S-TRAP assisted trypsin+LysC digestion, the eluates were vacuum dried and solubilized in 60µl of LC-Buffer (3% ACN (v/v) in 0.1% Formic acid (v/v). The peptide amounts were measured using a nanodrop at 224 nm absorbance for an equal loading on LC-MS/MS analysis. 4 µg of peptide digest was spiked with 1 µl of iRT peptides (Biognsosys) samples were then transferred into LC glass vials. LC-MS/MS data was acquired on Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer which is in-line with Dionex ultimate 3000 nano-liquid chromatography system. Samples were loaded onto a 2 cm pre-column (C18, 5 µm, 100 Ao , 100 µ, 2 cm Nano-viper column # 164564, Thermo Scientific) at 5 µl/minute flow rate using loading pump for about 5 minutes and then resolved the peptides on a 50 cm analytical column (C18, 5 µm, 50 cm, 100 Ao Easy nano spray column # ES903, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 250 nl/minute flow rate by applying nonlinear gradient of solvent-B (80% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid for about 125 minutes with a total gradient time and run time of 145 minutes. The data was acquired in DIA-mode with a variable isolation window scheme (The isolation window scheme and key MS parameters are provided in supplemental table 1). Full MS was acquired and measured using Orbitrap mass analyser at 120,000 resolution at m/z 200 in the mass range of 375 - 1500 m/z, AGC target was set at 300% (~ 3E6 ions) with a maximum ion injection time for 30ms. tMS2 (vDIA) scans were acquired and measured using Orbitrap mass analyzer at 30,000 resolution at 200 m/z with an AGC target of 3000% (~ 3E6 ions) with a maximum ion injection accumulation time for 70 ms. Precursor ions were fragmented using normalized higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using stepped collision energies of 25, 28 and 32. Both MS1 and MS2 scans were acquired in a profile mode and advanced peak determination algorithm was enabled for accurate monoisotopic envelopes and charge state determination. Loop control was set for 24 scans of tMS2 and one single MS1 scan was acquired per duty cycle. A total of 45 vDIA windows were enabled covering the mass range of 350 to 1500 m/z.

### Data Protocol
DIA datasets from GolgiTAG-IP, ControlTAG-IP and their whole cell extracts were imported into the Spectronaut software suite (Version Rubin: 15.7.220308.50606) for library free search or direct DIA to create a search archive using pulsar search algorithm. Furthermore, this search archive was appended to the deep Golgi-tag DDA data to create a hybrid library (DDA+DIA) containing 261,484 precursors, 205,320 modified peptides and 9,629 protein groups and this library was used for the main library-based DIA search.The data were searched against the hybrid library and Human Uniprot database (Released July, 2021) using default Spectronaut search settings and filtered for precursor and protein Q-value cut-off of 1%. Excluded single hits and quantification were performed using MS2 intensity values. The protein group tables were exported for further downstream analysis. The protein group files were further processed using Perseus software version (1.6.15.0). Missing values were imputed and the data was normalized using quantile normalisation. T-test was performed between GolgiTAG-IP and ControlTAG-IP as well as between GolgiTAG-IP and GolgiTAG whole-cell extracts and also between GolgiTAG whole-cell and ControlTAG whole-cell condition and the p-values were corrected using 1% permutation-based FDR. The data visualisation was further performed using in-house R scripts.
