### Title
Extracellular matrix proteome remodelling in human glioblastoma and medulloblastoma

### Description
Medulloblastomas (MBs) and Glioblastomas (GBMs) are high-incidence central nervous system tumors. Different origin sites and changes in the tissue microenvironment have been associated with onset and progression. Here, we describe differences between the ECM signature of these tumors. We compared the proteomic profiles of MB and GBM decellularized tumor samples among each other and their normal decellularized brain site counterparts. Our analysis reveals that 19 proteins were differentially expressed in MBs, 28 proteins in GBMs, and 11 proteins in both MBs and GBMs. Next, we validated key findings by protein tissue array with 53 MB and 55 GBM cases and evaluated the clinical relevance of the identified differentially expressed proteins through their analysis on publicly available datasets, 763  MB samples from microarray-GSE50161, and 115 GBM samples from RNAseq-TCGA. We report a shift towards a denser fibrillary ECM as well as a clear alteration in the glycoprotein signature, which influences the tumor pathophysiology.

### Sample Protocol
ECM enrichment through decellularization was achieved through a two-step process under mild agitation. The tissue fragments were incubated in 1% Triton-X (Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 15 min at room temperature; following incubation in 2.0% deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich) until complete decellularization. All the steps were followed by three washes of 15 min with PBS. Pellets containing ECM proteins were resuspended in 1% sodium deoxycholate containing 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and sonicated using probe tip sonicator three times on ice at 40% power for 30 seconds each. Extracted proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 56°C and subsequently alkylated in 40 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30min in the dark. Following incubation, the samples were digested with trypsin 2% (w/w) overnight at 37°C temperature. Samples were acidified with 1% formic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min to stop trypsin digestion and remove insoluble material (e.g. lipids). Supernatant was collected and desalted. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted using self-made micro-columns made with a C18 plug taken from a C18 disk (Sigma-Aldrich) and inserted in the constrict end of a P200 tips.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed into MaxQuant software v1.6.2.10 using Andromeda search engine against SwissProt Homo sapiens database (20,400 entries downloaded from Uniprot.org Jan/2019) with common contaminants for protein identification. Database searches were performed with the following parameters: precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, product ion mass tolerance of 0.6 Da; trypsin cleavage with two missed cleavage allowed; carbamidomethylation of cysteine (57.021 Da) was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine (15.994 Da) and protein N-terminal acetylation (42.010 Da) were selected as variable modifications. All identifications were filtered to achieve a protein and peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% and one unique peptide was required for protein identification. Protein quantification was based on the MaxQuant label-free algorithm using both unique and razor peptides for protein quantification. Protein abundance was assessed on label-free protein quantification (LFQ) based on extracted ion chromatogram area of the precursor ions activating the matching between run features. Intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values were used to calculate the relative protein abundance within samples.

### Publication Abstract
Medulloblastomas (MBs) and glioblastomas (GBMs) are high-incidence central nervous system tumors. Different origin sites and changes in the tissue microenvironment have been associated with the onset and progression. Here, we describe differences between the extracellular matrix (ECM) signatures of these tumors. We compared the proteomic profiles of MB and GBM decellularized tumor samples between each other and their normal decellularized brain site counterparts. Our analysis revealed that 19, 28, and 11 ECM proteins were differentially expressed in MBs, GBMs, and in both MBs and GBMs, respectively. Next, we validated key findings by using a protein tissue array with 53 MB and 55 GBM cases and evaluated the clinical relevance of the identified differentially expressed proteins through their analysis on publicly available datasets, 763 MB samples from the GSE50161 and GSE85217 studies, and 115 GBM samples from RNAseq-TCGA. We report a shift toward a denser fibrillary ECM as well as a clear alteration in the glycoprotein signature, which influences the tumor pathophysiology. MS data have been submitted to the PRIDE repository, project accession: PXD023350.
