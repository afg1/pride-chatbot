### Title
Barley seed proteome -  Shotgun proteomics of the barley seed proteome

### Description
Quantitative comparison of proteomes from two-rows (Conrad cultivar) and six-rows (Lacey cultivar) barley seeds.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from barley seeds were extracted into Urea/Ammonium Bicarbonate, quantitated and 50ug TCA ppt. Ppt proteins were trypsin digested, SPE C18 cleaned up and 1ug injected under reverse phase separation and nanoflow conditions into Orbitrap Elite instrument.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was searched with Mascot (Matrix Science) search engine and quantitative analysis was perfomed using spectral counts in Scaffold (Proteome Softare) in cojungtion ion precursor intensities using MaxQuant suite (Max Planck Institute)
