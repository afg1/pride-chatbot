### Title
Proteomic characterization of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor biopsies

### Description
We analyzed the proteome of tumor and matched non-tumor biopsies from 51 treatment-naive Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients by DIA (SWATH). Thereby we aim to find subgroups of patients characterized by specific pathway activation. Furthermore, we aim to find novel factors involved in HCC development and novel biomarkers.

### Sample Protocol
Fresh liver biopsies from 51 HCC and 11 normal livers were immediately snap-frozen in LN2 and processed as previously described (Dazert et al., 2016). In brief, each frozen biopsy was crushed on dry ice into a fine powder (cryogenic grinding) and transferred into a cooled 1.5 ml tube containing 150 - 400 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 8M urea, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, Complete Mini Protease Inhibitors (Roche), PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitors (Roche)). The biopsy lysate was vortexed for 5 min, rotated for 1h at 4°C and sonicated in a VWR Ultrasonic cleaner bath (USC300T) for 2 min. Next, the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15°C at 14.000 rpm and supernatant was removed and stored. Next, 50 μl of fresh lysis buffer were added and the sample was homogenized with a Teflon pestle in a hand homogenizer (Pellet Pestle Motor, Kontes/Kimble, USA) at maximum speed on ice twice for 1 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15°C at 14.000 rpm and supernatant was removed and pooled with previous one. Protein concentration was measured with a Bradford assay. Next, proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1h at 37 °C and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT in the dark, both with gentle shaking. Urea concentration was lowered to 4 M with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Lysates were digested with two rounds of endoproteinase LysC (Wako) at a 1:100 enzyme-to-protein ratio at 37°C for two hours. Next, the urea concentration was lowered to 1 M. Lysates were digested with two rounds of trypsin (Sigma): 1:50 ratio overnight and 1:100 ratio for 2 h at 37°C. Digestion was stopped with TFA to a final concentration of 0.5%. Digests were centrifuged for 2 min at 1,500 g and desalted on a C18 SepPak cartridge (50mg column for up to 2.5mg peptide load capacity) (Waters) or C18 Macrospin/Microspin cartridge (Waters). Peptide concentration was estimated at 280nm, aliquots were taken and peptides were dried in the SpeedVac. Human HCC biopsies were measured by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH) (Gillet et al., 2012). From each biopsy, 30 μg of peptides were used for SWATH analysis and 100 μg of peptides were used for library preparation. The biopsies from the 11 patients with healthy livers were measured individually and also as a pool. This pool was measured as a reference several times over the course of the project to account for potential batch effects. Ten biopsy samples were measured together as one batch of samples on the same capillary column. For library generation, 100 μg of peptides from each of the 10 biopsies of one batch were pooled together and subjected to high-pH fractionation with a total of 1mg of peptide injected by 5 individual injections of 200 μg. Peptides were fractionated by high-pH reversed phase separation using a XBridge Peptide BEH C18 column (3,5 μm, 130 Å, 1mm x 150 mm, Waters) on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system. Peptides were loaded on column in buffer A (ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) in H2O) and eluted using a two-step linear 60 min gradient from 2% to 50% (v/v) buffer B (90% acetonitrile / 10% ammonium formate (20 mM, pH 10) at a flow rate of 42 μl/min. Elution of peptides was monitored with a UV detector (215 nm, 254 nm). A total of 36 fractions were collected and  pooled into 12 fractions using a post-concatenation strategy (Wang et al., 2011). Peptides were dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A) and OD was measured. 20 μg of each fraction were used for library measurements.  The biopsy samples were analyzed on a Thermo Fisher QExactive Plus instrument coupled to an Easy nLC 1000. For SWATH analysis of the biopsy samples, 1.1 μg was injected on column including 10% of iRT peptide mix (HRM kit Ki-3003, Biognosys, Zurich, Switzerland). For library generation, 2 μg of each high pH fraction including 10% of iRT peptide mix (HRM kit Ki-3003) were injected on column. Proteomes were analyzed by capillary LC-MS/MS using a homemade separating column (0.075 mm × 38 cm) packed with Reprosil C18 reverse-phase material (2.4-μm particle size; Dr. Maisch). The solvents used for peptide separation were 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid and 80% AcCN in water (solvent B). Two microliters of sample were injected. A linear gradient from 0–40% solvent B in solvent A in 190 min was delivered with the nano pump at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. After 190 min, solvent B was increased to 95% in 5 min. The eluting peptides were ionized at 2.5 kV. Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. For SWATH measurements, one Full MS-SIM scan at resolution of 70.000 was followed by 40 mass windows of dynamic size ranging from 400 to 1600 m/z with 4 kDa overlap at a resolution of 17.500. For library measurements, the mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode and the precursor scan was done in the Orbitrap at 70,000 resolution. A top-20 method was run.

### Data Protocol
SWATH data analysis The library was generated with MaxQuant (version 1.5.1.2) (Cox and Mann, 2008) using the default settings except that the mass tolerance of the instrument was set to 10 ppm and the minimal ratio count for quantification was set to 1. The Uniprot SwissProt database (17th August 2015) including the iRT fusion peptide was used for the searches. All library measurements were pooled into one MaxQuant analysis to generate one general HCC library. The raw SWATH MS runs of the individual biopsies were converted using the HTRMS converter (Biognosys). The converted SWATH runs were analyzed with Spectronaut X (Version 12.0.20491.20.29183) (Biognosys) using the default settings and searched against our in-house generated general HCC library. Proteome analysis Raw protein-group based data were exported from Spectronaut and imported into FileMakerPro Advanced (Version FMP18) for further data processing. The raw intensities of the triplicates were averaged and the mean values transformed by the logarithm to the base 2. Next, the values were normalized by median subtraction. To account for potential batch effects, the log2 median-subtracted intensities of each biopsy were normalized to the mean intensity of all measured runs of the pool of healthy liver tissue. The proteome of the patient biopsies was continuously measured over a time frame of 2 years. Throughout this time period also aliquots of the pooled healthy sample were measured. All measured runs of the pooled healthy sample were therefore averaged for normalization. Log2-fold changes were calculatedin FileMakerPro. Statistical data analysis was performed in Perseus version 1.5.1.6 (Cox and Mann, 2012).
