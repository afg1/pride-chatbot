### Title
Proteomics Characterization of Longitudinal CSF from ALS Fast and Slow Progressors

### Description
Each CSF sample was concentrated and added to a multiple affinity removal spin cartridge .The eluates were subjected to a buffer exchange and proteins were reduced using DTT and alkylated using iodoacetamide. Digestions were performed using trypsin. CSF from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was characterized via LC-MS/MS. Biomarkers were identified to differentiate fast and slow progressors.

### Sample Protocol
Data was acquired on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer, coupled to a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC.

### Data Protocol
Raw spectra were searched against a human (2017) Swissprot database using MaxQuant. Two missed cleavages were allowed, with oxidation (M) and N-term acetylation as variable modifications, and carabidomethyl (C) as a fixed modification. Statisitical analyses and figures generation were performed in R.
