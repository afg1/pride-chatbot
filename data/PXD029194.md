### Title
C-terminal-dependent control of EAAT2 signaling, corticostriatal synaptic glutamate clearance and spontaneous motor activity in mice with hypokinesia

### Description
Deficiency of the astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2) and, consequently, inefficient glutamate clearance at corticostriatal synapses may contribute to the depression of self-initiated movements in HuntingtonÕs disease (HD). Here we report that the removal of the last 68 amino-acids in the C-terminal of EAAT2 increases the levels of native EAAT2 in striatal lysates and counteracts some of the HD-related changes in the interactor spectrum of mYFP-tagged EAAT2. Using the Q175 mouse model of HD, we explored the functional consequences of C-terminal modifications. It was found that astrocytic expression of EAAT2-S506X or -4KR alleviates the HD-related decrease in the incidence and velocity of exploratory movements. It also stimulates astrocytic glutamate uptake, increases the level of synaptic EAAT2 and improves glutamate clearance at single corticostriatal synapse. The experiments illuminate a link between the intracellular regulation of astrocytic glutamate transport in the striatum and symptoms of hypokinesia in HD mice.

### Sample Protocol
The animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane, transcardially perfused with cooled aerated saline containing (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride (NMDG) - 92, KCl - 2.5, NaH2PO4 - 1.25, NaHCO3 - 25, glucose - 20, CaCl2 - 0.5, MgCl2 - 10, Na pyruvate - 3, and Na ascorbate - 5 (pH 7.35, 303 mosmol/l). Brains were quickly removed, placed into a custom-made slicing mould and immersed into ice-cold oxygenated NMDG preparation solution. 2 mm thick sagittal slices where cut at a distance of 1-3 mm from midline. The striata were dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was pulverized under cryogenic conditions using a cryo-grinder set (CG 08-02, OPS Diagnostics, Lebanon, NJ, USA). The samples were solubilized in 200 µl lysis buffer containing (in mM) NaCl 150, Tris pH 7.5 50, n-ethylmaleimide  20, dithiothreitol (DTT) 1 supplemented with glycerol 5%, igepal ca-630 1% and Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail -1x  (all from Sigma-Aldrich ). The samples were kept on ice for 30 min and homogenized at 5000 rpm for 10 sec every 10 min using a Polytron PT1300D homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14.000 x g for 10 min at 4 C. The cleared lysate was diluted with 300 µl wash buffer (in mM) NaCl 150, Tris pH 7.5  50, DTT  1, glycerol 5% and incubated for 2 h with 30 µl of pre-washed GFP-Trap magnetic agarose beads (gtma-20, ChromoTek, Planegg-Martinsried) using gentle rotation at 4 C. Protein complexes were isolated using a DynaMag-2 magnet (ThermoFisher Scientific), washed once in wash buffer containing igepal ca-630 0.05%  and two more times in normal wash buffer before short-term storage of the samples at -18 C. The protein complex-containing beads were processed for analyses with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as follows: digestion buffer (sodium deoxycholate - 1%, dithiothreitol - 10 mM, ammonium bicarbonate - 50 mM) was added to the beads for 45 min at room temperature. Proteins were submitted to alkylation with 55 mM chloroacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. 500 ng Endopeptidase LysC  (Wako, Neuss) and 500 ng sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, GER) was added and samples were digested over night at 37 C. Samples were acidified with formic acid (final concentration 1%) and peptides were extracted and desalted using the StageTips protocol. Peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography on an in-house manufactured 20 cm fritless silica microcolumns with an inner diameter of 75 µm, packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch), using a 98 min gradient with a 250 nl/min flow rate of increasing Buffer B concentration (from 2% to 60%, Buffer B: 90% acetonitrile) on an High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system (ThermoFischer Scientific). Eluting peptides were directly ionized by electrospray ionization and transferred into a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode with performing full scans in Orbitrap (60K resolution; 4 x 105 ion count target; maximum injection time 50 ms), followed by top 20 MS2 scans using higher-energy collision dissociation (NCE of 32; 15K resolution, 5 x 104 ion count target; 0.7 m/z isolation window; maximum injection time: 250Êms). Only precursor with charge states between 2-7 were fragmented. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 sec.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed using the MaxQuant software (v1.6.0.1). The internal Andromeda search engine was used to search MS2 spectra against a decoy UniProt database for mouse (MOUSE.2018-05), as well as the sequences of the mYFP fusion constructs, containing forward and reverse sequences. The search included variable modifications of oxidation (M) and N-terminal acetylation, deamidation (N and Q) and fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptide and protein identifications. The integrated label-free quantification and IBAQ calculation algorithm were activated. Unique and razor peptides were considered for quantification. Retention times were recalibrated based on the built-in nonlinear time-rescaling algorithm and MS/MS identifications were transferred between LC-MS/MS runs with the Match between runs option, in which the maximal retention time window was set to 0.7 min. The resulting text files were used for further analyses using the Perseus software package. LFQ intensity values were used for quantification. Reverse hits, contaminants and proteins only identified by site were filtered out. After log2 transformation missing values were imputed with random noise simulating the detection limit of the mass spectrometer. The signals obtained from any given animal (pooling the tissue from both striata) were normalized to the mYFP signal median intensity calculated from all samples. Only protein groups with >3 peptides and log2 LFQ intensities >= 23 in all 4 samples were considered for statistical analyses. Differential protein abundance was calculated using two-sample Students t test. Abundance differences between the samples with a p value of <=0.05 in a two-tailed t-test were considered significant.
