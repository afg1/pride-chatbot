### Title
Fractionated Proton Irradiation does not Impair Hippocampal Dependent Short Term or Spatial Memory in Female Mice

### Description
The environment outside the Earth’s protective magnetosphere is a much more threatening and complex space environment. The dominant causes for radiation exposure, solar particle events and galactic cosmic rays, contain high-energy protons. In space, astronauts need healthy and highly functioning cognitive abilities, of which the hippocampus plays a key role. Therefore, understanding the effects of 1H exposure on hippocampal-dependent cognition is vital for de-veloping mitigative strategies and protective countermeasures for future missions. To investi-gate these effects, we subjected 6-month-old female CD1 mice to 0.75 Gy fractionated 1H (250 MeV) whole-body irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. The cognitive perfor-mance of the mice was tested 3 months after irradiation using Y-maze and morris water maze tests. Both sham-irradiated and 1H-irradiated mice significantly preferred exploration of the novel arm compared to the familiar and start arms, indicating intact spatial and short-term memory. Both groups statistically spent more time in the target quadrant, indicating spatial memory retention. There were no significant differences in neurogenic and gliogenic cell counts after irradiation. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed no significant upregulation or down-regulation of proteins related to behavior, neurological disease, or neural morphology. Our data suggests 1H exposure does not impair hippocampal-dependent spatial or short-term memory in female mice.

### Sample Protocol
Eight week old female CD1 mice were purchased from Charles rivers (Wilmington, MA, USA) and housed five animals per cage. The mice received standard rodent chow and water ad libitum until they reached 6 months of age. Once the animals were 6 months old, they were transferred to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where they were ac-climated for 1 week before they were exposure. We subjected twenty-four 6-month-old fe-male CD1 mice to 0.75 Gy fractionated 1H (250 MeV) whole-body irradiation (0.15 Gy per day for 5 days). Each mouse was placed in a ventilated acrylic box to minimize move-ment. Holders were then placed in a foam fixture with the long axis of the animal (head to toe) perpendicular to the direction of the beam exposed to whole-body irradiation with a linear energy transfer (LET) of ~0.39 keV/µm. The mice were exposed to a square beam of approximately 20 × 20 cm. Sham-irradiated mice were placed into the plastic enclosures for the same amount of time and on the same day and during the same time of day as the irradiated mice. Dosimetry and beam properties were controlled by NASA Space Radia-tion Laboratory physicists. After irradiation, animals were transported back to the Univer-sity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) by overnight airlift and given 2020X chow containing 150 ppm fenbendazole for eight weeks, as a routine UAMS quarantine proce-dure. Mice remained housed five per cage with Enrich-o’Cob® (The Andersons, Inc) bed-ding. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of UAMS and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Behavioral and immuno-histochemical analyses were recorded in a double-blind analysis by 2 technicians. Treat-ment groups were assigned, coded, and held until the cellular analyses were complete. Mice were tested for cognitive performance with Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests 3 months after irradiation (Figure 1). Only female mice were studied because previ-ous studies were prominently performed on male mice.  Tandem mass tag (TMT) technology is a powerful tool for precise and accurate quan-titative proteomics. This method has been used widely to characterize protein expression profiles and investigate and compare functional changes at the protein level. The protocol involves extraction of proteins from hippocampal tissues followed by reduction, alkyla-tion, and digestion. Samples from each experimental group were labeled with 1 of 6 iso-baric tags of the TMT reagent. Resulting peptides were pooled at equal concentrations be-fore fractionation and data acquisition. The TMT-labeled samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified and reporter ions quantified by searching the UniprotKB Mus musculus database (June 2021) using MaxQuant (version 2.0.3.0; Max Planck Institute) with a parent ion tolerance of 3 ppm, a fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da, a reporter ion tolerance of 0.001 Da, trypsin enzyme with 2 missed cleavages, variable modifications including oxidation on M, Acetyl on Protein N-term, and fixed modification of Carbamidomethyl on C.  Protein and peptide identifications are accepted if they could be established with less than 1.0% false discovery.  Protein TMT MS3 reporter ion intensity values are assessed for quality using our in-house ProteiNorm app, a user-friendly tool for a systematic evaluation of normalization methods, imputation of missing values and comparisons of different differential abundance methods. The cyclic loess normalized data was used to perform statistical analysis using Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) with empirical Bayes (eBayes) smoothing to the standard errors (ref). Proteins with an FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 were considered to be significant.
