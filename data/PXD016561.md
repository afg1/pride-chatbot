### Title
Characterization of Fasciola heptica extracellular vesicles recovered by gravity flow

### Description
Parasite-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now at the forefront of helminth research, with evidence indicating that they exhibit immune modulatory activity, presenting a strong case to look at their potential as vaccine candidates. In the present study, Fasciola hepatica derived EVs (FhEVs) were isolated from adult worms using a gravity flow method. These gravity flow derived FhEVs were characterised by proteomics and lectin array. Comparative analysis using the same methods was carried out using FhEVs recovered by differential centrifugation. The immunomodulatory properties of the gravity flow derived FhEVs was determined using bone marrow derived murine dendritic cells (BMDCs), which highlighted that the FhEVs induce a novel  phenotype that secreted low levels of TNF, enhanced expression of cell surface markers (CD80, CD86, CD40, OX40L and SIGNR1) and intracellular markers (SOCS1 and SOCS3). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FhEVs modulate immune cells, inducing a unique DC phenotype that supresses IL-2 secretion from T-cells.

### Sample Protocol
Fasciola hepatica extracellular vesicles (FhEVs) were recovered from the excreted-secreted (ES) proteins using an adaptation of the protocol by Muscante et al. (2014). Following 5 hours of parasite culture the ES products were collected and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 mins and then 700 x g for 30 mins to eliminate large debris. The supernatant was decanted into a sterile separating funnel attached to dialysis tubing with at molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 1000 kDa. The dialysis tubing was clamped at the bottom with a plastic clip and the set-up held in a class II biosafety cabinet. The hydrostatic pressure of the solution in the funnel forces the solution through the dialysis membrane. The solution was rinsed three times with 100 ml sterile PBS and allowed to concentrate to a volume of 10 ml. The solution was then transferred from the dialysis membrane into a sterile syringe and filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. This filtrate containing FhEVs was aliquoted and stored at -80°C. Protein digestion and mass spectrometry analyses were performed by the Proteomics Platform of the CHU de Québec Research Center (Quebec, Qc, Canada). EV samples were washed using an Amicon Ultra 3 kDa column with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer before being dried by evaporation in a SpeedVac (ThermoFisher Scientific).  Protein samples were solubilized in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 1% sodium deoxycholate and then reduced with 0.2 mM DTT at 37°C for 30 min and alkylated with 0.9 mM iodoacetamide at 37°C for 20 min. Trypsin digestion of the protein samples was performed in solution using 0.1 µg sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37°C. The trypsin reaction was stopped by acidification using 3% acetonitrile, 1% TFA and 0.5% acetic acid. The digested peptides were purified by stage tip (C18), vacuum centrifuge dried and then re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid.  The re-suspended peptide samples were separated by online reversed-phase (RP) nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography (nanoLC) using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 nanoRSLC chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific / Dionex Softron GmbH, Germering, Germany).  Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) analysis was performed on a Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA,USA) utilising the Orbitrap Fusion Tune Application 2.0 and fitted with a nanoelectrospray ion source.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS peak lists (MGF files) were generated using Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., version 2.2.0) and analysed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.1), set up to search against a database comprised of gene models identified from the F. hepatica draft genome (version 1.0, 101,780 entries; PRJEB6687; Cwiklinski et al., 2015a), assuming digestion with trypsin with two missed cleavages permitted. Fragment and parent ion mass tolerance were set at 0.60 Da and 10.0 PPM, respectively. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and the deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, and oxidation of methionine specified as variable modifications.    Scaffold (version 4.8.4, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Putative annotation of the F. hepatica gene models was assigned using in silico tools; Uniprot, Gene Ontology (GO) and InterproScan (Cwiklinski et al., 2015a).

### Publication Abstract
Parasite-released extracellular vesicles (EVs) deliver signals to the host immune system that are critical to maintaining the long-term relationship between parasite and host. In the present study, total EVs (FhEVs) released in vitro by adults of the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica were isolated using a recently described gravity flow method that protects their structural integrity. The FhEVs molecular cargo was defined using proteomic analysis and their surface topology characterised by glycan microarrays. The proteomic analysis identified 618 proteins, 121 of which contained putative N-linked glycosylation sites while 132 proteins contained putative O-linked glycosylation sites. Glycan arrays revealed surface-exposed glycans with a high affinity for mannose-binding lectins indicating the predominance of oligo mannose-rich glycoproteins, as well as other glycans with a high affinity for complex-type N-glycans. When added to bone-marrow derived dendritic cells isolated FhEV induced a novel phenotype that was categorised by the secretion of low levels of TNF, enhanced expression of cell surface markers (CD80, CD86, CD40, OX40L, and SIGNR1) and elevation of intracellular markers (SOCS1 and SOCS3). When FhEV-stimulated BMDCs were introduced into OT-II mice by adoptive transfer, IL-2 secretion from skin draining lymph nodes and spleen cells was inhibited in response to both specific and non-specific antigen stimulation. Immunisation of mice with a suspension of FhEV did not elicit significant immune responses; however, in the presence of alum, FhEVs induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response with high antigen specific antibody titres. Thus, we have demonstrated that FhEVs induce a unique phentotype in DC capable of suppressing IL-2 secretion from T-cells. Our studies add to the growing immuno-proteomic database that will be an important source for the discovery of future parasite vaccines and immunotherapeutic biologicals.
