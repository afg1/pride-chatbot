### Title
Systematic Identification of the Lysine lactylation in the Protozoan Parasite Toxoplasma gondii

### Description
Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a new posttranslational modification (PTM) identified in histone and nonhistone proteins of several eukaryotic cells that directly activate gene expression and DNA replication. However, very little is known about their scope and cellular distribution in apicomplexan parasites that are important to public and animal health. Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of toxoplasmosis, is one of obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite that can infect all kinds of nucleated cells of animals and humans. Using this parasite as model organism, herein, we produced the first global lysine lactylome profile through LC-MS/MS. Overall, a total of 983 Kla sites occurred on 523 lactylated proteins were identified in Toxoplasma tachyzoites, the acute toxoplasmosis-causing stage. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these lactylated proteins are evolutionarily conserved and involved in a wide variety of cellular functions such as energy metabolism, gene regulation and protein biosynthesis. Moreover, the results from subcellular localization analysis and IFA showed that the majority of lactylated T. gondii proteins localized in the nucleus, indicating a potential impact of Kla on gene regulation. Notably, an extensive batch of parasite-specific proteins unique to Apicomplexa is lactylated in T. gondii. Our findings revealed that Kla was widespread in the early branching eukaryotic cell, and that lactylated proteins, including a crowd of unique parasite proteins, were involved in a remarkably diverse array of cellular functions. These valuable data will improve our understanding of the evolution of Kla while potentially providing novel therapeutic avenues.

### Sample Protocol
The parasites washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were resuspended in lysis buffer [1% SDS, 1% protease inhibitors, 1% phosphatase inhibitor, 3 μM Trichostatin A (TSA) and 50 mM Nicotinamide (NAM)] and sonicated on ice for 3 min, pause for 3 s per 3 s for 30% intensity. Sonicated lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g. Collected protein supernatants were added successively with 1 volume and 4 volumes of pre-cooled acetone for precipitation at 4 °C for 2 h. The air-dried protein precipitate was resuspended in 200 mM TEAB and digested overnight with trypsin (Promega) at a 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio at 37 °C. The digested peptides were reduced with 5 mM DTT at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature (RT) for 15 min in the dark. Then, the alkylated peptide lysates were resolubilized in IP buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5% NP-40, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA pH8.0) and mixed overnight with anti-L-lactyllysine antibody-conjugated agarose beads (PTM-1404; PTM Bio., Hangzhou, China) at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Beads were washed 4 times with IP buffer and twice with water. Peptides were eluted from beads with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and vacuumed-dried. The dried peptides were desalted using C18 ZipTips (EMD Millipore).

### Data Protocol
Gene Ontology (GO) of lactylation proteome was derived from the ToxoDB 58.0 and UniProt-GOA database based on three categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. When a single peptide was found to be matched to two or more different proteins, manual inspection of these data from ToxoDB 58.0 was performed to determine the protein from which the peptide was likely derived. For the identified Kla substrates not annotated by ToxoDB 58.0 and UniProt-GOA database, the InterProScan software then could be used to annotate protein’s GO function based on protein sequence alignment. InterPro domain database was used to annotate the identified proteins domain functional description with InterProScan based on protein sequence alignment. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database description of identified proteins was annotated and mapped by using KEGG online service tools KAAS and KEGG mapper, respectively. WoLF PSORT was used for subcellular localization predication.
