### Title
In vivo BioID Mouse heart masspec data

### Description
Cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling requires dyads, the nanoscopic microdomains formed adjacent to Z-lines by apposition of transverse (T)-tubules and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). Disruption of dyad architecture and function are common features of diseased cardiomyocytes. However, little is known about the mechanisms that modulate dyad organization during cardiac homeostasis and disease. Here, we used proximity proteomics in intact, living hearts to identify proteins enriched near dyads.

### Sample Protocol
0.5 mg protein extracts were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen, #M280). The beads were then washed 5 times with RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz, # sc-24948) and stored in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for on-bead digestion. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was performed by LC at Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed following the routine AP-MS approach
