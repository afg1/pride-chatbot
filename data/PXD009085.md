### Title
rat serum exosomes after restriction stress

### Description
The project investigates the occurrence of brain derived proteins as biomarkers for restriction oder immobilisations stress.

### Sample Protocol
Rats were stressed by restriction and/or immobilisation. Serum exosomes of those rats were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by inGel-digestion and nanoLC-MS/MS or directly by shut-gun proteomics for protein content determination.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data were processed by ProteomeDiscoverer V. 1.4 using seqiest serach algorithm. FDR was set < 1%.
