### Title
A2ML1's and A2M's reactivity towards glycine and glycerol, A2ML1 crosslinking to thermolysin

### Description
A2ML1 (wildtype and H1084N) and A2M (wildtype and N1088H) were activated by chymotrypsin, allowing their thiol ester to react with protease, water, or the added substrates glycerol or glycine.

### Sample Protocol
After reactions, samples were acidified with acetic acid, digested overnight with pepsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Initial DDA runs defined thiol ester-covering peptides, after which a PRM study was performed for quantification.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed using Byonic for spectra assignment and Skyline for quantification, as described in the manuscript.
