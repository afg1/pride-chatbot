### Title
TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that FBLN2 and NPR3 are involved in the early MSCs osteogenic differentiation

### Description
The intriThe intricate balance between MSCs differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes is finely regulated. To explore novel participating molecules, we screened for early-stage osteogenesis- or adipogenesis-based MSCs protein expression profile using TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Protein annotation, hierarchical clustering, functional stratification, and protein-protein association assessments were performed. Moreover, two upregulated proteins, namely, FBLN2 and NPR3, were validated to participate in the osteogenic differentiation process of MSCs. Subsequently, we independently downregulated FBLN2 and NPR3 during 7 days of osteogenic differentiation, and conducted quantitative proteomics analysis to assess the differential protein regulation between knockdown and control cells. Based on gene ontology (GO) and network analyses, FBLN2 deficiency induced functional alterations associated with biological regulation and stimulus response, whereas, NPR3 deficiency induced functional alterations related to cellular and metabolic processes, and so on. These results demonstrated that proteomics is still an effective tool for the comprehensive exploration of the MSCs differentiation process. cate balance between MSCs differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes is finely regulated.

### Sample Protocol
Sample was sonicated three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz) in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). (Note: For PTM experiments, inhibitors were also added to the lysis buffer, e.g. 3 μM TSA and 50 mM NAM for acetylation.) The remaining debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined with BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For digestion, the protein solution was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in darkness. The protein sample was then diluted by adding 100 mM TEAB to urea concentration less than 2M. Finally, trypsin was added at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion.After trypsin digestion, peptide was desalted by Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex) and vacuum-dried. Peptide was reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT kit/iTRAQ kit. Briefly, one unit of TMT/iTRAQ reagent were thawed and reconstituted in acetonitrile. The peptide mixtures were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and pooled, desalted and dried by vacuum centrifugation.The tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (15-cm length, 75 μm i.d.). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 6% to 23% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) over 26 min, 23% to 35% in 8 min and climbing to 80% in 3 min then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 400 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Q ExactiveTM Plus (Thermo) coupled online to the UPLC. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The m/z scan range was 350 to 1800 for full scan, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000. Peptides were then selected for MS/MS using NCE setting as 28 and the fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans with 15.0s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4. Fixed first mass was set as 100 m/z.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 4 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in First search and 5 ppm in Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification and Acetylation modification and oxidation on Met were specified as variable modifications. FDR was adjusted to < 1% and minimum score for modified peptides was set > 40.

### Publication Abstract
The delicate equilibrium between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of MSCs is highly regulated. We screened for early-stage osteogenesis- or adipogenesis-based MSCs protein expression profiles using TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis to identify novel participating molecules. Protein annotation, hierarchical clustering, functional stratification, and protein-protein association assessments were performed. Moreover, two upregulated proteins, namely, FBLN2 and NPR3, were validated to participate in the osteogenic differentiation process of MSCs. After that, we independently downregulated FBLN2 and NPR3 over seven days of osteogenic differentiation, and we performed quantitative proteomics analysis to determine how different proteins were regulated in knockdown vs. control cells. Based on gene ontology (GO) and network analyses, FBLN2 deficiency induced functional alterations associated with biological regulation and stimulus-response, whereas NPR3 deficiency induced functional alterations related to cellular and metabolic processes, and so on. These findings suggested that proteomics remains a useful method for an in-depth study of the MSCs differentiation process. This will assist in comprehensively evaluating its role in osteoporosis and provide additional approaches for identifying as-yet-unidentified effector molecules.
