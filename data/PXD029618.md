### Title
Podocyte injury in Fabry nephropathy

### Description
Current therapies for Fabry disease are based on reversing intra-cellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) by enzyme replacement (ERT) or chaperone mediated stabilization, thereby alleviating lysosome dysfunction. However, the therapeutic effect in the regression of end-organ damage (ie. kidney damage) is limited. Ultrastructural analysis of serial human kidney biopsies showed that long-term use of ERT reduced Gb3 accumulation in podocytes but did not alter podocyte injury. A novel CRISPR-/CAS9-mediated ÔÅ°-Galactosidase knockout podocyte cell line confirmed ERT-mediated reversal of Gb3 accumulation without resolution of lysosomal dysfunction. Transcriptomic-based connectivity mapping and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics identified alpha-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation as a key event mediating podocyte injury.

### Sample Protocol
For MS analysis, SILAC labeling of human immortalized podocytes was performed for 14 days as previously described (Schell et al., 2017). Based on SILAC labeling and protein concentration WT and KO samples were mixed 1:1 for MS-analysis. LC-MS/MS data analysis was performed as reported before (Weise et al., Mol Neurobiol, 2019).

### Data Protocol
The MS raw data files were uploaded into the MaxQuant software version 1.4.1. which performs peak and SILAC-pair detection, generates peak lists of mass error corrected peptides and data base searches.

### Publication Abstract
Current therapies for Fabry disease are based on reversing intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or chaperone-mediated stabilization of the defective enzyme, thereby alleviating lysosomal dysfunction. However, their effect in the reversal of end-organ damage, like kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, remains unclear. In this study, ultrastructural analysis of serial human kidney biopsies showed that long-term use of ERT reduced Gb3 accumulation in podocytes but did not reverse podocyte injury. Then, a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated &#x3b1;-galactosidase knockout podocyte cell line confirmed ERT-mediated reversal of Gb3 accumulation without resolution of lysosomal dysfunction. Transcriptome-based connectivity mapping and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics identified &#x3b1;-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation as a key event mediating podocyte injury. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SNCA improved lysosomal structure and function in Fabry podocytes, exceeding the benefits of ERT. Together, this work reconceptualizes Fabry-associated cell injury beyond Gb3 accumulation, and introduces SNCA modulation as a potential intervention, especially for patients with Fabry nephropathy.
