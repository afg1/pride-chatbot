### Title
Mouse brain protein turnover - Brain protein turnover in mouse models of neurodegeneration, and in ageing healthy tissue

### Description
Brain protein turnover in mouse models of neurodegeneration, and in ageing healthy tissue

### Sample Protocol
Brain proteins were extracted or precipitated with various detergents, electrophoresed through denaturing gels and peptides generated by in-gel digestion with trypsin. Peptides were separated by nanoflow LC-MS and tandem mass spectra aquired using a QExactive plus.

### Data Protocol
Peptide pairs were idetified and sequenced using MaxQuant, and the datasets were integrated using Perseus, R, excel and Prism.
