### Title
PROTOMAP analysis of Human Cartoid Plaques

### Description
Human cartoid plaques were removed in operating room and placed in tube with PBS.Plaques were then analyzed for presence of rupture.  The ulcerated lesicon was then excised and subjected to protein extraction.  Areas of stable plaque tissue was then excised as a control.

### Sample Protocol
100ug of protein extract from stable and ruptured plaque tissue was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.  Each gel lane was cut into 22 bands and in-gel digested using trypsin.  The peptides were then analyzed on either and LTQ or LTQ-Velos mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
RAW files from each run were searched using the sequest algorithm followed by PROTOMAP analysis.
