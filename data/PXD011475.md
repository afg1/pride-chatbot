### Title
espB deletion mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

### Description
The ESX-1, type VII, secretion system represents the major virulence determinant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of the most successful intracellular pathogens. Here, by combining genetic and high-throughput approaches, we investigate the effect of espB on the secretion of ESX-1 components and other proetins, as well as virulence.

### Sample Protocol
Each sample was digested by Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) (1) with minor modifications. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was replaced by Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) as reducing agent and Iodoacetamide by Chloracetamide as alkylating agent. A combined proteolytic digestion was performed using Endoproteinase Lys-C and Trypsin. Acidified peptides were desalted on C18 StageTips (2) and dried down by vacuum centrifugation. For LC MS/MS analysis, peptides were resuspended and separated by reversed-phase chromatography on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoUPLC system in-line connected with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass-Spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). 1- Wiśniewski JR, Zougman A, Nagaraj N, Mann M.

### Data Protocol
Database search was performed using MaxQuant 1.6.0.1 (3) against the TubercuListR27 database (http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/). Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M), phosphorylation (S,T,Y) and acetylation (Protein N-term) were considered as variable modifications. Label Free Quantification (MaxLFQ) was performed by MaxQuant using the standard settings (4). Perseus (5) was used to highlight differentially quantified proteins. Reverse proteins, contaminants and proteins only identified by sites were filtered out. Biological replicates were grouped together and protein groups containing a minimum of two LFQ values in at least one group were conserved. Empty values were imputed with random numbers from a normal distribution. Significant hits were determined by a volcano plot-based strategy, combining t test p-values with ratio information (6). Significance curves in the volcano plot corresponding to a SO value of (indicate your selected cutoff) and 0.05 FDR were determined by a permutation-based method. Further graphical displays were generated using homemade programs written in R (7). 3- Cox, J. & Mann, M.
