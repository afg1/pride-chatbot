### Title
A549 CD38 phosphoproteomics analysis

### Description
A549 CD38 overexpression cells phosphoproteomics analysis

### Sample Protocol
CD38(-) A549 cells were cultured in SILAC culture media and CD38(+) A549 cells were cultured in normal RMPI-1640 media. Cells were harvested and lysed for 30 min on ice with RIPA lysis buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) supplemented with 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Supernatants were collected after centrifugation and four-volumes of ice-cold acetone added, followed by overnight precipitation at -20C. The supernatant was discarded after 7,600 rpm centrifugation at 4C for 10 min, and pellets dissolved in 8 M urea (in 10mM HEPES, pH8.0). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Protein (5mg) was used for the following experiment. In-solution digestion was performed. Protein disulfides were reduced by dithiothreitol at 1 mM for 60 min at room temperature, and free cysteine residues alkylated with iodoacetamide at 5 mM for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. Protein samples were digested with trypsin for 14 h at 37C. Peptides were desalted with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, and fractioned by HPLC separation. Collected eluents were combined into 12 fractions and dried by speedvac. Each fraction was dissolved with 10mL 80% acetonitrile and 5%TFA. TiO2 beads (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) were pre-incubated in 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aladdin, Shanghai, China) in 80% acetonitrile and 1%TFA (5μl/mg of beads) for 20 min. 2 mg of beads was added to every fraction and incubated on rotator for 30 min. Beads were washed twice with 30% acetonitrile and 1%TFA, loaded into C8 STAGE-TIP, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. Then, beads were washed on-tip with 50% acetonitrile and 1%TFA followed by 80% acetonitrile and 1%TFA. Peptides were eluted with 20 μL 5% ammonium hydroxide, 20 μL 10% ammonium hydroxide, and 10% ammonium hydroxide with 25% acetonitrile. Reduced the volume by speedvac and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The search criteria were: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavage sites were allowed; oxidation of methionine, 13C(6)15N(2) at lysine, 13C(6) at arginine, deamidation at asparagine and glutamine, phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed modification; and precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm for all MS and 20 mmu for all MS2 spectra. Peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using the percolator function provided by Proteome Discoverer, with a cutoff score of 1% based on decoy database searching.

### Publication Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays an essential role in all aspects of human life. NAD levels decrease as humans age, and supplementation with NAD precursors plays a protective role against aging and associated disease. Less is known about the effects of decreased NAD on cellular processes, which is the basis for understanding the relationship between cellular NAD levels and aging-associated disease. In the present study, cellular NAD levels were decreased by overexpression of CD38, a NAD hydrolase, or by treating cells with FK866, an inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Quantitative proteomics revealed that declining NAD levels downregulated proteins associated with primary metabolism and suppressed cell growth in culture and nude mice. Decreased glutathione synthesis caused a 4-fold increase in cellular reactive oxygen species levels, and more importantly upregulated proteins related to movement and adhesion. In turn, this significantly changed cell morphology and caused cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Secretomic analysis also showed that decreased NAD triggered interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x3b2;) secretion, which activated integrin-&#x3b2;-catenin, TGF&#x3b2;-MAPK, and inflammation signaling pathways to sustain the signaling required for EMT. We further revealed that decreased NAD inactivated sirtuin 1, resulting in increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) acetylation and phosphorylation, and STAT3 activation. Repletion of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid inactivated STAT3 and reversed EMT, as did STAT3 inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that decreased NAD activates multiple signaling pathways to promote EMT and suggests that age-dependent decreases in NAD may contribute to tumor progression. Consequently, repletion of NAD precursors has potential benefits for inhibiting cancer progression.
