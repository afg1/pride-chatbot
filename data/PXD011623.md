### Title
Validation expression of three proteins by LC-PRMMS

### Description
In this study, the levels of expression of three proteins (LBP_cg1290, Enoyl-(Acyl carrier protein) reductase; LBP_cg1294, Acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase; LBP_cg1793, Penicillin binding protein 2B) were validated using LC-PRMMS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts were prepared in triplicate by collecting and lysing the collected cells with SDT lysate. The protein concentration of the supernatants was assayed with the Pierce BCA protein Assay kit. 200 µg of protein was mixed with 30 μl SDT buffer and denatured in 8 M urea buffer. The low molecular weight components in the denatured protein mix were removed by repeated ultrafiltration. Then, the filtrates were incubated in 100 μl iodoacetamide for 30 min in dark to block reduced cysteine residues. Finally, the protein suspensions were digested with 4 μg trypsin in 40 μl TEAB buffer overnight at 37°C. For each sample, the peptides were collected after centrifugation through the filter.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed using Skyline. The differentially expressed proteins in each sample were quantified relative to the standard reference.
