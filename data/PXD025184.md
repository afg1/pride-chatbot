### Title
Glyoxal induces senescence of human keratinocytes through oxidative stress and activation of the AKT/FOXO3a/p27KIP1 pathway

### Description
Senescence is a well-known cellular event characterized by specific markers like a permanent cell proliferation arrest and the secretion of messenger molecules forming the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The SASP composition depends on many factors such as the cell type or the nature of the stress that induced senescence. Since the skin constitutes a barrier with the external environment, it is particularly subjected to different types of stresses and thus to premature cellular aging. The dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal and methylglyoxal are precursors of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs), known to be a feature of normal and pathological aging. In this study, we have demonstrated that glyoxal provokes oxidative stress by increasing ROS and AGEs levels and can induce senescence in human keratinocytes. An “early-stage” senescence phenotype characterized by a cell cycle arrest mediated by the AKT-FOXO3-p27KIP1 pathway and a “late-stage” senescence maintained by the p16INK4/pRb pathway were evidenced. Moreover, we characterized the resulting secretory phenotype during early senesecence by mass spectrometry. Our study provides evidence that glyoxal can affect keratinocyte function and act as a driver of human skin aging. Hence, senotherapeutics aimed at modulating glyoxal-associated senescence phenotype could be relevant to prevent the aging process in skin.

### Sample Protocol
Four biological replicates of conditioned culture media (secretomes) from 4 distinct cell culture conditions (untreated, 200 µm GO, 300 µm GO and RS) were digested by “Strap” Micro Spin Column (Protifi, Hutington, NY) using trypsin (sequencing-grade from Promega, Madison, WI), according to manufacturer’s instruction. 25 µg of each sample were denatured v/v with a solution contained 4% SDS (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL), 400 mM TEAB (Sigma Aldrich), 20 mM TCEP (Sigma Aldrich) and 100 mM ClAA (from Fluka) for 5 min at 95°C. The denatured secretomes were acidified with 12% phosphoric acid at 1:10 (acid: protein volume ratio). 6 volumes of Strap Binding Buffer (90% Methanol, 100 mM TEAB) were added. The resulting protein suspension was transferred to the Strap filter. After centrifugation and wash, the filter was incubated with trypsin (1:50, enzyme: protein) in 100 µL of 50 mM TEAB at 37°C overnight. Resulting peptides were fractionated on strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) StageTips in five different fractions. Peptides from each of these 5 fractions were separated by Reverse phase C18 using an u3000 RSLC chromatographer from Dionex on a 2 µm particle size, 100 Angström pore size, 75 µm internal diameter, 25 cm length C18 reverse phase analytical column with a 3 h binary gradient from 99% solution A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) to 55% solution B (80% ACN, 0.085% formic acid) before injection into an Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer MS (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). MS data acquisition was performed throughout the elution process in a data-dependent scheme (top speed mode in 3 seconds) with full MS scans acquired with the orbitrap detector, followed by HCD peptide fragmentation and Ion trap fragment detection of the most abundant ions detected in the MS scan. Mass spectrometer settings for full scan MS were: 1.0E6 AGC, 60,000 target resolution, 350-1500 m/z range, maximum ion injection time (MIIT) of 60 ms. HCD MS/MS fragmentation was permitted for 2-7+ precursor ions reaching more than 5.0E3 minimum intensity. Quadrupole-filtered precursors within 1.6 m/z isolation window were fragmented with a Normalised Collision Energy setting at 30. 1.0E5 AGC Target and 60 ms MIIT were the limiting ions accumulation values. The Ion-trap detector was used for its fast and sensitive detection capabilities. A 30 seconds dynamic exclusion time was set.

### Data Protocol
Maxquant software version 1.6.6.0 (Cox et al., 2014) was used for the data extraction from the raw MS files from mass spectrometer. The databases used were the human sequences from the Uniprot database (June 2018, 42394 entries) and a list of in-house frequent contaminant sequences. The cleavage specificity was trypsin’s with maximum 2 missed cleavages.  Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as constant modification, whereas acetylation of the protein N terminus and oxidation of methionines were set as variable modifications. The false discovery rate was kept below 1% on both peptides and proteins. The normalization was permitted and “match between runs” (MBR) option was allowed with a match time window of 0,7 min and an alignment time window of 20 min. For statistical analysis, data were imported into the Perseus software version 1.6.2.3 (Tyanova et al., 2016). Reverse and contaminant proteins were excluded from analysis. LFQ intensity data were transformed into log2. Only the proteins with at least 3 out of 4 replicates valid LFQ intensity value per condition were selected. The data were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). An adjusted p-value was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate and a q-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The data analysis was following by a Perseus Tukey’s post hoc and the mean of LFQ per condition was calculated. Hierarchical clustering was performed with the default value of Perseus (distance Pearson correlation) subsequent to the normalization of the mean by Z-scoring.

### Publication Abstract
Senescence is a well-characterized cellular state associated with specific markers such as permanent cell proliferation arrest and the secretion of messenger molecules by cells expressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype composition depends on many factors such as the cell type or the nature of the stress that induces senescence. Because the skin constitutes a barrier with the external environment, it is particularly subjected to different types of stresses and consequently prone to premature cellular aging. The dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal are precursors of advanced glycation end products, whose presence marks normal and pathological aging. In this study, we show that GO treatment provokes oxidative stress by increasing ROS and advanced glycation end-products levels and induces senescence in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, GO-induced senescence bears a unique molecular progression profile: an early-stage senescence when protein kinase B&#x2012;FOXO3a-p27<sup>KIP1</sup> pathway mediates cell cycle arrest and a late-stage senescence maintained by the p16<sup>INK4</sup>/pRb pathway. Moreover, we characterized the resulting secretory phenotype during early-stage senescence by mass spectrometry. Our study provides evidence that GO can affect keratinocyte functions and act as a driver of human skin aging. Hence, senotherapeutics aimed at modulating GO-associated senescence phenotype hold promising potential.
