### Title
ECM of proliferative vs dormant HNSCC

### Description
The goal of this project is to characterize the ECM composition of actively proliferative and dormant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma xenografts and identify components of the ECM niche instructing tumor cell dormancy.

### Sample Protocol
Samples for ECM proteomic analysis  Samples used for the ECM proteomic study were as followed: Control vs DDR1 knockdown D-HEp3 HNSCCs: 150mg - 200mg of D-HEp3 shCTRL tumors (n=4) and D-HEp3 shDDR1 tumors (n=4) were analyzed.  Decellularization Samples described above were mechanically disrupted using a Bullet Blender (Next Advance). Tumor lysates were then subjected to incubation in a series of buffer (CNCS Compartmental Protein Extraction Kit, Millipore) resulting in the extraction of soluble and mostly intracellular components and the enrichment for insoluble extracellular proteins (for more details, see Naba et al. Mol. Cell. Prot, 2012 and Naba et al., JoVE, 2015).   Digestion of proteins into peptide ECM-enriched protein samples were resuspended and reduced in a solution of 8M urea containing 10mM DTT (Pierce). Samples were alkylated with 25mM iodoacetamide (Pierce), deglycosylated with PNGaseF (New England BioLabs) and digested with mass-spectrometry-grade endopeptidase Lys-C (Pierce) and trypsin (Pierce) as previously described (for more details, see Naba et al. Mol. Cell. Prot, 2012 and Naba et al., JoVE, 2015). Samples were acidified and desalted according to standard procedure and stored at -80�C prior to proteomic analysis.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry analysis of control (D-HEp3 sh CTRL) vs DDR1 knockdown (D-HEp3 shDDR1) tumors was performed at Proteomics Core Facility at the University of Illinois at Chicago on a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Velos Pro coupled with Agilent NanoLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The LC columns (15 cm x 75 �m ID, Zorbax 300SB-C18) were purchased from Agilent. Samples were analyzed with a 120-min linear gradient (0-35% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) and data were acquired in a data-dependent manner in which MS/MS fragmentation was performed on the top 10 intense peaks of every full MS scan. Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over m/z 350-1800 range with resolution 30,000 (m/z 400). The target value was 1.00E+06. The ten most intense peaks with charge state >= 2 were fragmented in the HCD collision cell with normalized collision energy of 35%, these peaks were then excluded for 30 s after 2 counts within a mass window of 10 ppm. Tandem mass spectrum was acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution of 7,500. The target value was 5.00E+04. The ion selection threshold was 5,000 counts, and the maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 500 ms for full scans and 250 ms for HCD. RAW files were converted into. mgf files using MSConvert (ProteoWizard). Database search was carried out using Mascot server version 2.6.2 (from Matrix Science). Mascot search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 100 mmu for fragment-ion mass tolerance; two missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine; and variable modifications were oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, pyro-glutamic acid modification at N-terminal glutamine, and hydroxylation of lysine and proline. Only peptides with a Mascot score >= 25 and an isolation interference <= 30 were included in the data analysis.  Mass spectrometry output were further annotated to identify ECM and non-ECM components using the Matrisome Annotator R-script we previously developed (Naba et al., Matrix Biology, 2016) and freely available at http://matrisome.org.

### Publication Abstract
Cancer cells disseminate and seed in distant organs, where they can remain dormant for many years before forming clinically detectable metastases. Here we studied how disseminated tumor cells sense and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to sustain dormancy. ECM proteomics revealed that dormant cancer cells assemble a type III collagen-enriched ECM niche. Tumor-derived type III collagen is required to sustain tumor dormancy, as its disruption restores tumor cell proliferation through DDR1-mediated STAT1 signaling. Second-harmonic generation two-photon microscopy further revealed that the dormancy-to-reactivation transition is accompanied by changes in type III collagen architecture and abundance. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that type III collagen levels were increased in tumors from patients with lymph node-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared to patients who were positive for lymph node colonization. Our data support the idea that the manipulation of these mechanisms could serve as a barrier to metastasis through disseminated tumor cell dormancy induction.
