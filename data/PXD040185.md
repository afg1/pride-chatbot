### Title
Proteomes of human brain organoids derived from individuals with creatine transporter deficiency

### Description
Next-generation proteomics of human brain organoids derived from individuals with creatine transporter deficiency in order to assess their characteristics as models of the pathophysiology.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for a short electrophoretic migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by  Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were then compared.
