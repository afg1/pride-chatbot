### Title
A proteome level study in the early stages of clubroot infection in Brassica napus canola.

### Description
Clubroot is a destructive root disease in Brassica species caused by a protist pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae. There is limited omics information available in response to the pathogen, especially in the early stages of pathogenesis. The goal of this study is to identify proteins (therefore genes) that are potentially involved in mediating resistance against clubroot pathogens and develop gene-specific markers to assist in molecular breeding.

### Sample Protocol
Peptides were analyzed using a Fusion Lumos Tribrid Orbitrap mass-spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a BoxCarDIA data acquisition scheme as described previously (Mehta et al., 2022). Briefly, the dissolved peptides were injected using an Easy-nLC 120 system (LC140; ThermoFisher Scientific) and separated using a 25 cm Easy-Spray PepMap C18 column (ES902; ThermoFisher Scientific). The column was equilibrated with 100% solvent A (0.1% FA) and the samples were eluted using a segmented solvent B gradient (80% ACN/0.1% FA) from 4 to 41% B (0–65 min). MS1 acquisition was performed using two multiplexed tSIM scans of 10 BoxCar windows each spanning a range of 350–1400 m/z. Detection was performed at 120,000 resolution and normalized AGC targets of 100% per isolation window. MS2 acquisition was performed using twenty-eight 38.5 m/z windows with an overlap of 1 m/z and a minimum m/z of 200. Resolution was set to 30,000 using a dynamic maximum injection time and the minimum desired points across each peak was set to 6.

### Data Protocol
BoxCarDIA raw files were processed using Spectronaut 16 (Biognosys AG, Wagistrasse, Schlieren Switzerland) under a directDIA analysis mode and default search parameters without N-acetyl variable modification as described in Mehta et al. (2022). Spectra were searched using a published B. napus Westar proteome (Song et al., 2020). Trypsin specificity was set to two missed cleavages and a protein and PSM false discovery rate of 1% each. Data filtering criteria was set to q-value ≤ 0.01 and global normalization with MS2-level quantification was performed. Comparative analysis between samples was performed using Spectronaut with a significance threshold of FDR-corrected p-value (Dunn, 1961) to identify differentially abundant proteins.
