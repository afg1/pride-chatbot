### Title
Coccolith Vesicle Proteins from Emiliania huxleyi

### Description
The aim was to partially purify coccolith vesicles and characterize their proteome.

### Sample Protocol
Coccolith vesicles were partially purified by density gradient centrifugation. The proteomes of the bottom fractions of the gradient were analysed. Calcifying 'C-cells' were compared to non-calcifying 'N-cells'.

### Data Protocol
Searches were performed with Mascot and Comet with downstream processing using the TPP
