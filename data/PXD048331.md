### Title
Global analysis of protein lysine lactylation profiles in the marine  bacterium Photobacterium damselae

### Description
Lactylation at lysine residue (Klac) modification is a novel PTM first discovered  on histones in mammalian cells in 2019 [8]. It has been observed that Klac modification on histones modulates macrophage polarization and state, and  influences cellular metabolic reprogramming in pluripotent stem cells and nonsmall cell lung cancer, and can even induce tumorigenesis [5,6]. Subsequent  investigations have shown that Klac modification extends to non-histone proteins in various subcellular compartments and proteins in prokaryotic cells. To date, Klac modification has been extensively identified in various organisms, including  humans [8,10-17], mice [18-20], rats [16], insects [21], plants (rice [22] and wheat  [23]), fungi (Botrytis cinerea [24] and Phialophora verrucosa [25]), algae  (Nannochloropsis oceanica [26]), parasites (Toxoplasma gondii [27] and  Trypanosoma brucei [28]), and bacteria (Escherichia coli [5] and Streptococcus  mutans [6]). These studies collectively demonstrate the evolutionary conservation  of Klac modification across diverse organisms.

### Sample Protocol
The preparation of proteins and in-solution trypsin digestion was conducted  following the method described in a previous study [33]. Briefly, the bacterial  pellets obtained were resuspended in a lysis buffer (8 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM  DTT, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail III (Calbiochem, USA)), and  sonicated on ice water. The protein concentration in the supernatant was then  quantified using the 2-D Quant kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Subsequently, the  protein samples obtained were reduced with 5 ml of DTT at 56 °C for 30 min,  followed by alkylation with 30 ml of iodoacetamide (IAM) at room temperature in  the dark for 45 min. Afterward, 5 volumes of pre-cooled methanol at -20 °C were  added to precipitate the proteins, and the mixture was kept at -20 °C overnight. The  resulting protein precipitate was subsequently centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and  the protein pellet obtained was washed twice with pre-cooled methanol and placed  at -20 °C for 1 h. Finally, the proteins were suspended in 0.1 M triethylammonium  bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer and digested with trypsin (Promega, USA) at a 1:50  enzyme/substrate ratio for 15 h at 37°C. The tryptic digestion peptides were  desalted using a Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex, USA) and then vacuumdried

### Data Protocol
All raw data files obtained from mass spectrometry analysis were analyzed using  MaxQuant software (v.1.5.2.8). Mass spectra were searched against the protein  database of P. damselae (29,932 entries) in UniProt. Carbamidomethylation on  cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation on methionine, lactylation  on lysine, and lactylation on protein N-terminal were set as variable modifications.  The false discovery rate (FDR) thresholds for peptides, proteins, and modification  sites were set at < 1%. Trypsin was set as a cleavage enzyme with up to 4 missing  cleavages, and the minimum number of amino acids for peptides was set at 7. The  site localization probability for Klac sites was set at > 0.75, and the minimum score  for modified peptides was set at > 40. Mass tolerances for precursor ions and  fragment ions were set at 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively.
