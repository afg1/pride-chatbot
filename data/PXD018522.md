### Title
Proteomic signatures of metronidazole-resistant Trichomonas vaginalis

### Description
We conducted iTRAQ-based analysis to profile the proteomes of metronidazole-sensitive (MTZ-S) and MTZ-resistant (MTZ-R) parasites.

### Sample Protocol
The protein sample was reduced with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP), followd by cysteine-blocking with methyl methanethiosulfonate, and digested by trypsin in solution containing TEABC. The peptides were then labeled with iTRAQ reagent. The dried sample mixtures were reconstituted with 30 % acetonitrile/0.1 % formic acid for analysis using a LTQ-Orbitrap ELITE mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The MS raw data were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer software. The MS/MS spectra was searched against the TrichDB-33_TvaginalisG3 sequence database using the Mascot search engine. 10 ppm mass tolerance. 0.05 Da for HCD fragment ions. oxidized methionine, acetyl(protein N-terminal), iTRAQ(N-terminal), and iTRAQ(lysine) as variable modifications, methylthio (cysteine) as the fixed modifications.
