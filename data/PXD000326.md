### Title
A multi-omic analysis of an Enterococcus faecium mutant reveals genetic mutation and dramatic changes of mRNA and protein expressions

### Description
Three iTRAQ8plex experiment replicate using TripleToF 5600 system. Protein identification were performed using the ProteinPilot software (version 4.0.8085,Paragon Algorithm version 4.0.0.0).All MS/MS spectra was search against amino acids sequences which is annotated from genome.        The search parameters was set as follows: Cys. Alkylation: Iodoacetic acid, Digestion: Trypsin, ID Focus: Biological modifications, Search Effort: Thorough. The search results was filter using Local FDR 5%.
