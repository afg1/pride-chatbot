### Title
Differential regulation of mRNA stability modulates transcriptional memory and facilitates environmental adaptation

### Description
Proteomic analysis of yeast samples incubated in condition inducing transcription memory. These changes were investigated in wild-type yeast cells and cells depleted in RRP6, one of the key components of nuclear exosome complex.

### Sample Protocol
Yeast samples were lysed in denaturing conditions, reduced with DTT, alkylated using iodoacetamide and digested with lysyl endopeptidase and trypsin to generate peptides. Peptides werecleaned-up using C18 columns prior to MS analysis

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry raw files acquired in DIA-MS mode were analyzed in Spectronaut 16.
