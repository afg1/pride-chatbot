### Title
Microwave oven-assisted derivatization of histone proteoforms using trimethylacetic anhydride

### Description
We introduce a new reagent – Trimethylacetic anhydride (TMA) for highly efficient histone derivatization, which is facilitated by microwave irradiation to reduce sample preparation duration. The derivatization of unmodified NH2- groups at histone lysine residues is necessary prior LC-MS analysis using bottom-up approach. Our methodology shows high labelling efficiency and demonstrates its utilization for histone posttranslational modification abundance monitoring. Therefore, to be an alternative to conventionally used methods.

### Sample Protocol
The chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line MEC-1 treated with Entinostat (enti) and without treatment (ctrl). Histone proteins acidic extraction. Sequential alkylation of unmodified NH2- groups at histone proteins, followed by digestion and another sequential alkylation of newly generated NH2- groups. Alkylation reaction enhanced by irradiation in microwave oven. Sample desalting and LC-MS/MS analysis with Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were searched against the modified cRAP contamination database (based on http://www.thegpm.org/crap/, 112 sequences), in-house histone database (v150710, 114 protein sequences, generated from UniProt ), and  UniProt KB Human database (v180912, taxon ID: 9606, 21053 sequences) using in-house Mascot search engine (v2.6.2, Matrix Science, United Kingdom) through Proteome Dicoverer software (v2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass error tolerance was 7 ppm (10 ppm for cRAP) and 0.03 Da (0.5 Da for cRAP) for precursors and fragments, respectively. Enzyme specificity was set to semiArg-C with 2 missed cleavages allowed for all databases. Variable modifications were as follows for individual databases: cRAP   acetylation (K), deamidation (N, Q), oxidation (M), trimethylacetylation (N-term, K, S, T, Y); Uniprot KB Human   acetylation (protein N-term, K) and trimethylacetylation (N-term, K); in-house histone – the same modifications as for Human database plus trimethylacetylation (S, T, Y), methylation (K, R), dimethylation (K), trimethylation (K). Search results were refined at 1 % false discovery rate with Percolator node on peptide spectrum match level. Selected peptide identifications were manually inspected, their quantity was determined and manually validated in Skyline software (v19.1.1.248) based on peak areas in EICs (extracted ion chromatograms).
