### Title
VE-cadherin associated proteins in the absence of lncRNA LASSIE

### Description
The shear stress-regulated lncRNA LASSIE interacts with junctional proteins (e.g. PECAM-1, which interacts with VE-cadherin) and influences endothelial barrier function. Here we characterize the remodeling of the VE-Cadherin complex by the lncRNA LASSIE. LASSIE silenced HUVECs were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-VE-cadherin antibody. Differentially associated proteins were identified by Mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed a significantly decreased association of cytoskeleton-linked proteins with VE-cadherin after silencing of LASSIE. Functional assays confirmed this result and characterized LASSIE as a stabilizer of junctional complexes in endothelial cells, important for normal shear stress sensing and barrier function.

### Sample Protocol
HUVECs (48h post transfection of siRNA control or siRNA Lassie) were lysed (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 % glycerol, 1 % NP-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 15 min on ice. For immunoprecipitation, 0.7 mg cell lysate was incubated with anti-VE-Cadherin antibody and 50 µl Dynabeads protein G (Thermo Scientific) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis and wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Beads were resuspended in 20 µl 6M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mM DTT and incubated at 95°C for 5 min. Reduced thiols were alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamid and sample were diluted with 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10% acetonitrile to obtain a final GdmCl concentration of 0.6 M. Proteins were digested with 1 µg Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) overnight at 37°C under gentle agitation. Digestion was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.5 %. Peptides were loaded on multi-stop-and-go tip (StageTip) containing three  C18-disks and 3 SCX-disks . Purification and elution of peptides was performed as described in Rappsilber and Mann (2007). Peptides  were eluted in wells of microtiter plates and peptides were dried and resolved in 1% acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid.  Liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed on Thermo Scientific™ Q Exactive Plus equipped with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography unit (Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000) and a Nanospray Flex Ion-Source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a C18 reversed-phase precolumn (Thermo Scientific) followed by separation on a with 2.4 µm Reprosil C18 resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH) in-house packed picotip emitter tip (diameter 100 µm, 15 cm long from New Objectives) using an gradient from mobile phase A (4% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 40 % mobile phase B (99% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 30 min followed by a second gradient to 60% B for 5 min with a flow rate 400 nl/min.  MS data were recorded by data dependent acquisition Top10 method selecting the most abundant precursor ions in positive mode for HCD fragmentation.  The Full MS scan range was 300 to 2000 m/z with resolution of 70000, and an automatic gain control (AGC) value of 3*E6 total ion counts with a maximal ion injection time of 160 ms. Only higher charged ions (2+) were selected for MS/MS scans with a resolution of 17500, an isolation window of 2 m/z and an automatic gain control value set to E5 ions with a maximal ion injection time of 150 ms. Selected ions were excluded in a time frame of 30s following fragmentation event. Fullscan data were acquired in profile and fragments in centroid mode by Xcalibur software.

### Data Protocol
For data analysis MaxQuant 1.6.1.0 (Cox and Mann, 2008, Nat. Biotechnology), Perseus 1.5.6.0 (Tyanova et al 2016) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2013) were used. N-terminal acetylation (+42.01) and oxidation of methionine (+15.99) were selected as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation (+57.02) on cysteines as a fixed modification. The human reference proteome set (Uniprot, February 2017, 71785 entries) was used to identify peptides and proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1%. Minimal ratio count for label-free quantification (LFQ) was 1. Reverse identifications and common contaminants were removed. Each sample was normalized to CDH5 abundance. Missing values were replaced by half of the lowest value. Significant interacting proteins were determined by permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) calculation and student´s t-Test.

### Publication Abstract
Blood vessels are constantly exposed to shear stress, a biomechanical force generated by blood flow. Normal shear stress sensing and barrier function are crucial for vascular homeostasis and are controlled by adherens junctions (AJs). Here we show that AJs are stabilized by the shear stress-induced long non-coding RNA LASSIE (linc00520). Silencing of LASSIE in endothelial cells impairs cell survival, cell-cell contacts and cell alignment in the direction of flow. LASSIE associates with junction proteins (e.g. PECAM-1) and the intermediate filament protein nestin, as identified by RNA affinity purification. The AJs component VE-cadherin showed decreased stabilization, due to reduced interaction with nestin and the microtubule cytoskeleton in the absence of LASSIE. This study identifies LASSIE as link between nestin and VE-cadherin, and describes nestin as crucial component in the endothelial response to shear stress. Furthermore, this study indicates that LASSIE regulates barrier function by connecting AJs to the cytoskeleton.
