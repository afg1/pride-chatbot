### Title
Minor Antigens in Membranous Nephropathy Identified by Mass Spectrometry

### Description
Background: Multiple autoantigens have been identified in membranous nephropathy (MN) by tissue-based proteomics. However, the antigenic targets of disease are unknown for >10% of MN and >50% of membranous lupus nephritis (MLN) cases. We identified multiple new targets in PLA2R-/THSD7A-/EXT-/NELL1-quadruple negative MN biopsies through mass spectrometry (MS) of immune complexes recovered from biopsy tissue of patients with MN.  Methods: MN cases negative for PLA2R, THSD7A, EXT1/2, and NELL1 were identified from a biopsy database. Protein G immunoprecipitation was used to recover immune complexes from frozen biopsy tissue, followed by interrogation by mass spectrometry (MS). Potential antigens were confirmed through paraffin immunofluorescence of protein targets, followed by co-localization with IgG within immune deposits. Consecutive series of 165 cases of PLA2R-negative MN biopsies and 95 MLN biopsies was screened to determine the frequency for each potential antigen.  Results: Seven protein targets were discovered within immune complexes from MN biopsies including FCN3, CD206, EEA1, SEZ6L2, NPR3, MST1, and VASN. Peptides from these proteins on MS were not enriched in PLA2R (n=86), THSD7A (n=64), NELL1 (n=64), or EXT1/2 (n=60) controls. Between 3-30 unique peptides were detected for each target. Frequencies of each antigen, determined by staining consecutive case series, were SEZ6L2 (1/165 idiopathic; 0/95 MLN), VASN (8/165 idiopathic; 2/95 MLN), EEA1 (6/165 idiopathic; 7/95 MLN), MST1 (6/165 idiopathic; 2/95 MLN), and FCN3 (0/165 idiopathic, 6/95 MLN), NPR3 and CD206 were positive in index cases. All cases showed co-localization of IgG within immune deposits.  Conclusion: Seven novel protein targets were identified in MN and MLN.

### Sample Protocol
Protein lysates were prepared from kidney biopsy tissue frozen in optimized cutting medium, through washing biopsy cores in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) four times, followed by disaggregation by bead-beating in 300 µl Pierce IP lysis buffer (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham MA, catalog #87787) with the addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, Thermo-Fisher, catalog #78440). Immunoprecipitations were performed through addition of 50 µl of magnetic protein G Dynabeads (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham MA, catalog #1003D) and incubation at room temperature for 1 hour with shaking. Following incubation, beads were washed with PBS four times to reduce non-specific protein binding.  After the final wash, the beads were frozen at -20°C until further analysis.  Digested peptides were analyzed by NanoLC/MS/MS using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. The peptides were loaded onto a reverse phase trap column (Integra-frit, New Objective, MA) containing 2.5 μm Waters XSelect CSH resin coupled to a 150 mm X 0.075 mm analytical column containing the same reverse phase resin as used in the trap. A nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp, Milfrd, MA) was then used to generate a 60 min gradient from 98:2 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. (Buffer A=0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B=0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.) Peptides were eluted from the column with an integrated spray tip (picofrit, New Objective) and ionized by electrospray (2.0 kV) followed by MS/MS analysis using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD). Survey scans of peptide precursors were performed at 240K resolution (at 400 m/z) with a 5 × 105 ion count target. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.6 Th with the quadrupole, HCD fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 30, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap.

### Data Protocol
The obtained MS/MS data was searched against the most recent Uniprot human database containing both the Swiss Prot and the TREMBL entries using MaxQuant. Visualization of data was done using Scaffold v4.6. The false discovery rate was set at 1% for the peptide-to-spectrum matches. Normalized iBAQ values from MaxQuant were used for quantitation. iBAQ distributions for each sample were adjusted to control for differences in loading. IBAQ values equal to zero were removed from the data set. For statistical hypothesis testing, a two-sample t-test was performed for each protein using normalized iBAQ values for the two groups. If a protein was only detected in one group, a one-sample t-test was performed, using the smallest detected iBAQ value as the null hypothesis.

### Publication Abstract
Multiple autoantigens have been identified in membranous nephropathy (MN) by tissue-based proteomics. However, antigenic targets of disease are unknown for over 10% of patients with MN and over half of those with membranous lupus nephritis (MLN). Here, we identified multiple new targets in PLA2R-/THSD7A-/EXT-/NELL1-quadruple negative MN biopsies through mass spectrometry of immune complexes recovered from biopsy tissue of patients with MN. Patients with MN negative for these four antigens were identified from Arkana Laboratories case archives. Protein G immunoprecipitation recovered immune complexes from frozen biopsy tissue from 142 quadruple-negative cases and 278 cases of known antigen type, followed by interrogation by mass spectrometry. Potential putative antigens were confirmed through paraffin immunofluorescence and co-localization with IgG within immune deposits. Consecutive series of 165 cases of PLA2R-negative MN and 142 MLN biopsies were screened to determine the frequency for each potential antigen. Seven putative antigens were discovered within immune complexes from biopsies of patients with MN including FCN3, CD206, EEA1, SEZ6L2, NPR3, MST1, and VASN. Peptides from these proteins were not enriched in the 278 cases of known antigen type. Between three to 30 unique peptides were detected for each new target. Frequencies of each biomarker, determined by staining consecutive case series, ranged from under 1 to 4.9%. NPR3 and CD206 were only positive in index cases. All cases showed co-localization of IgG within the immune deposits. Thus, seven putative antigens were newly identified in MN and MLN. Due to the number of antigens identified, it is becoming impractical to type PLA2R-negative MN or MLN cases through immunostaining alone. A multiplex approach is needed for subtyping of these diseases.
