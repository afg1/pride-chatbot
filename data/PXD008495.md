### Title
The temporal profile of activity-dependent presynaptic phospho-signalling reveals a PP1-dependent reduction in vesicle release

### Description
Depolarization of presynaptic terminals stimulates calcium influx, which evokes neurotransmitter release and activates phosphorylation-based signalling. Here, we present the first global temporal profile of presynaptic proteins undergoing post-stimulus phospho-signalling to reveal long-lasting changes, key substrates and master regulators. A total of 5,715 unique phosphopeptides from 1,817 proteins were profiled and 1,917 phosphopeptides had activity-dependent phosphorylation sites. A new computational method, KinSwing, combining protein kinase substrate prediction and activity across time, enabled the prediction of effector protein kinase activity. CaMKII responded rapidly to depolarization. MAPK, CDK5 and GSK3Î² had a post-stimulus role in compensating for initial dephosphorylation. Despite this, the post-stimulus period was dominated by down-regulation of phosphorylation and was exacerbated by conditions stimulating increased calcium influx. Down-regulated phosphorylation correlated with perturbed phospho-signalling to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory molecules and reduced glutamate and fluorescent dye release. Inhibition PP1 prevented reduction in dye release, identifying PP1 as a major signalling target and mediator of post-stimulus presynaptic phospho-signalling.

### Sample Protocol
Lys-C/trypsin digestion, quantitative reductive dimethylation, phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2 and sequential elution from IMAC (SIMAC), pre-fractionation via hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), followed by LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite
