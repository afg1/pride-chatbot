### Title
Secretomics reveals gelatinase substrates at the blood-brain barrier that are implicated in astroglial barrier function

### Description
The[Q3] gelatinases, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, are key for leukocyte penetration of the brain parenchymal border in neuroinflammation and the functional integrity of this barrier; however, it is unclear which MMP substrates are involved. Using a tailored, sensitive, label-free mass spectrometryÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased secretome approach, not previously applied to nonimmune cells, we identified 119 MMP-9 and 21 MMP-2 potential substrates at the cell surface of primary astrocytes, including  known substrates (ÃŽÂ²-dystroglycan) and a broad spectrum of previously unknown MMP-dependent events involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Using neuroinflammation as a model of assessing compromised astroglial barrier function, a selection of the potential MMP substrates were confirmed in vivo and verified in human  samples, including vascular cell adhesion moleculeÃ¢â‚¬â€œ1 and neuronal cell adhesion molecule. We provide a unique resource of potential MMP-2/MMP-9 substrates specific for the astroglia barrier. Our data support a role for the gelatinases in the formation and maintenance of this barrier but also in astrocyte-neuron interactions.

### Sample Protocol
We performed secretome analyses from conditioned media of WT; Mmp2Ã¢Ë†â€™/Ã¢Ë†â€™, Mmp9Ã¢Ë†â€™/Ã¢Ë†â€™, and Mmp2Ã¢Ë†â€™/Ã¢Ë†â€™/Mmp9Ã¢Ë†â€™/Ã¢Ë†â€™ DKO astrocytes; and WT cells treated with MOBSAM (fig. S2, A and B). Proteins in the conditioned media were digested with trypsin and endoproteinase LysC, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to MS (LC-MS/MS). Raw MS data were analyzed in the MaxQuant environment (19). As gelatinases act mainly extracellularly, we predicted that the abundance of extracellularly annotated peptides would be lower in secretomes of MMP knockouts (KOs), as elimination of MMPs would result in less cleavage of substrates and fewer peptides released into the supernatant. By contrast, peptides derived from intracellular protein domains would not change. Accordingly, we classified identified peptides as intra- or extracellular.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and quantification from MS raw files were performed using the computational proteomics platform MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.1) (19). Murine MS/MS spectra were searched against the respective UniProt FASTA[Q34] databases and a common contaminant database by the implemented Andromeda search engine (59). Trypsin/P with a minimum peptide length of seven amino acids and a maximum of two missed cleavages was used as digestion mode. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. False discovery rates were 1% at the peptide and protein level. Peptide identification was performed with an allowed initial precursor mass deviation up to 4.5 parts per million (ppm) and an allowed fragment mass deviation of 20 ppm. Protein identifications required one unique or razor peptide. For nonlinear retention time alignment of all samples, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Match between runsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option of MaxQuant was used. The time windows for matching peptide identifications across different samples and to search for the best alignment function were set to 0.7 and 20 min. For LFQ via MaxLFQ, a minimum ratio count of 1 was used

### Publication Abstract
The gelatinases, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, are key for leukocyte penetration of the brain parenchymal border in neuroinflammation and the functional integrity of this barrier; however, it is unclear which MMP substrates are involved. Using a tailored, sensitive, label-free mass spectrometry-based secretome approach, not previously applied to nonimmune cells, we identified 119 MMP-9 and 21 MMP-2 potential substrates at the cell surface of primary astrocytes, including known substrates (&#x3b2;-dystroglycan) and a broad spectrum of previously unknown MMP-dependent events involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Using neuroinflammation as a model of assessing compromised astroglial barrier function, a selection of the potential MMP substrates were confirmed in vivo and verified in human samples, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and neuronal cell adhesion molecule. We provide a unique resource of potential MMP-2/MMP-9 substrates specific for the astroglia barrier. Our data support a role for the gelatinases in the formation and maintenance of this barrier but also in astrocyte-neuron interactions.
