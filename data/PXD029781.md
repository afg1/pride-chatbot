### Title
CerS2 dependent Sphingolipid - protein interactions in rat beta cell line Ins1E

### Description
To define the beta cell Sphingolipid-protein interactome, we performed a chemoproteomic screen in which a chemically modified SL precursor (photoactivatable and clickable sphingosine, pacSph) was fed to cells and rapidly incorporated into de novo synthesized SLs. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation covalently crosslinked cellular SL-protein complexes, allowing for cell lysis under harsh conditions, pulldown and subsequent MS-based identification and quantification of SL interacting proteins. CrispR/Cas9 knockout of the SL specific catabolic enzyme Sgpl1 ensured that only SLs are labelled with pacSph. Furthermore, stable isotope labelling allowed direct comparison of SBPs in several cell lines in the same MS run.

### Sample Protocol
All Ins1E cells in this experiment were Sgpl1 null cells (not further mentioned). SILAC labelled control cells (medium or heavy) as well as CerS2 deficient cells were treated with pacSph (synthetic sphingolipid precursor), followed by UV irradiation (or as control, no irradiation) to crosslink Sphingolipid-protein complexes. After cell lysis, biotin was added to the artifical pacSph-protein complexes via Click-Chemistry, followed by Streptavidin-based pulldown. After in-gel digestion, samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
For bioinformatical analysis, raw files were searched with MaxQuant against an UniProt Reference Proteome database specific for Rattus norvegicus and against MaxQuants internal common contaminants database. The resulting protein groups table was further analyzed using Perseus together with plugins linking to R. After data cleanup, resulting protein intensities were log2 transformed. To determine specific interactors for sphingolipids, ratios against the non-UV control were calculated for both UV-treated samples (control + UV vs. control -UV cells; CerS2 KO cells +UV vs. control cells -UV). One-sample t-tests were used to determine true interactors. In addition, protein exclusively present in +UV samples were also considered. Missing intensity values were imputed from normal distribution, and the data normalized using both "remove batch effect" (method: limma) and the "quantile normalization" function.
