### Title
Proteomic analysis of microdissected renal tubules

### Description
Kidney is a vital organ which help maintain body homeostasis. Three related processes including glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion are precisely regulated in the kidney in response to changes in the amount of both water and various solutes. To understand how the kidney can achieve this challenging goal, it is important to know the protein composition in the kidney. However, unlike other solid organs, kidney has a very intricate architecture, including at least 14 distinct tubule segments. This reason limits the interpretibility of experiments perfomred using whole kidney homegenate samples. To mitigate this problem, we combined kidney tubule microdissection technique with protein mass spectrometry to study the proteome of 14 individual rat kidney tubule segment.

### Sample Protocol
The kidney tubule samples were obtained from male Sprague Dawley rats age 4-8 weeks following standard microdissection protocol (Lee et al, PMID: 25817355). For each sample, several tubules were pooled together based on length to achieve 2-3 microgram of protein amount. Tubules were lyzed in 1.5%SDS/100mM TEAB by pipetting under microscope, followed by sonication for 5 minutes. Samples were kept frozen at -80C until further processed. To prepare sample for mass spectrometry analysis, we followed SP3 protocol (with some minor modifications). Trypsin/Lys-C mixed was used to digest protein samples. The resulting peptide mixtures were fractionated into 8 fractions and subsequently concatenated to 4 fractions using basic reversed phase C18 micro HPLC on STAGE tip. Peptide samples were injected into Dionex UltiMate 3000 nano LC system connected to the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Peptides were introduced into a peptide nanotrap at a flow rate of 5 ������������������L/min. The trapped peptides were fractionated with a reversed-phase EASY-Spray PepMap column (C18, 75 ������������������m ������������������ 50 cm) using a non-linear gradient from 2 to 28% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid (runtime 120 minutes). Data dependent acquisition (DDA) was performed with MS1 resolution of 120,000 and MS2 resolution of 15,000-30,000 at cycle time of 3 seconds.

### Data Protocol
All raw files were search against rat uniprot reference proteome (release 2019_10) using MaxQuant 1.6.10.43. Fixed modification included carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications included oxidation (M), and acetyl (Protein-N-term). Trypsin/P was set as the digestion enzyme. Match-between-run option is enable. Other parameters were kept as default.
