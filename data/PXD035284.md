### Title
Characterization of FOXD3 cofactors by BioID

### Description
FOXD3 is essential in embryonic stem cells, however the primary molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we performed BioID to identify proteins collaborating with FOXD3 in protecting embryonic stem cell survival.

### Sample Protocol
Peptides were obtained by trypsinization and purified using SOLA C18 desalting columns as described in (Huang et al 2020 Nature Communications).

### Data Protocol
Proteomics data was processed using Maxquant v1.5.1.2 and searched against the mouse proteome.
