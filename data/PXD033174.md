### Title
Glorund IP-MS in Drosophila late stage oocyte enriched ovary

### Description
Identification of interaction partners of the sole Drosophila hnRNP F/H homolog, Glorund, during late oogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
Late-stage ovaries expressing GFP-tagged proteins were homogenized in IP buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL-CA630, 1x cOmplete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF) supplemented with 20 µL of RNase A/T1 Mix (Thermo Scientific) and 20 U of RNase ONE (Promega) per 1 mL of IP buffer and cleared by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 30 min at 4° C. The supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap_A beads (Chromotek) at 4°C for 1.5 hours and the beads were then washed with IP buffer without IGEPAL-CA630. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in 0.1% (v/v) TFA and subject to LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was done by the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core at Princeton University. The resulting MS datasets were analyzed using Scaffold 4/5.
