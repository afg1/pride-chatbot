### Title
Indentification of CaMKK2-binding proteins in 293T cells

### Description
Indentification of CaMKK2-binding proteins under cystine starvation condition in 293T cells.

### Sample Protocol
Immuno-precipitated proteins in 293T cells overexpressed with Flag-EV or Flag-CaMKK2 were separated via SDS-PAGE, digested and peptides extracted. Peptide indentification via LC-MS, analysis via Proteomics Discovery Software (version 2.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific)

### Data Protocol
Data were searched against the human UniProt database (version 20140922, 20,193 sequence)
