### Title
Immune surveillance of brain metastatic cancer cells is mediated by IFITM1 (The coimmunoprecipitated proteins associated with the endogenous membrane IFITM1 of H1299 cells after IFNγ stimulation)

### Description
To examine the molecular basis of IFITM1 function, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay of cell membrane proteins followed by mass spectrometry analysis.

### Sample Protocol
To identify proteins associated with endogenous membrane IFITM1, H1299 cells (4×107) were treated with 1,000 U/ml human IFNγ (300-02, Peprotech) at 37 ℃. After 48 hr, the cell membrane was prepared using a Nucl-Cyto-Mem Preparation Kit (P1201, Applygen). A total of 13.95 mg of cell membrane proteins was incubated with 30 μg of an anti-IFITM1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) or 30 μg of mouse IgG isotype control for 2 hr at 4 ℃ and was then incubated with 40 μl of Protein G Plus Agarose (22851, Pierce) overnight. Immunoprecipitates were separated on a NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris Gel (NP0341BOX, Invitrogen) and visualized using EZBlueTM Gel Staining Reagent (G1041-500ML, Sigma). The entire gel lanes were excised (excluding the IgG bands) and subjected to ESI-LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.3.0, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Swissprot database (Homo sapiens taxonomy, 2015 download). Trypsin was chosen as the enzyme and one missed cleavage were allowed. Peptide mass tolerances were set at 15 ppm, and fragment mass tolerances were set at 20 ppm. Fixed modifications allowed were Carbamidomethyl (C); Variable modifications allowed were Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q), and Oxidation (M). Data were filtered using at peptide score >21, or extensive homology (p<0.05) and requiring minimum of one specific peptide per protein.

### Publication Abstract
Brain metastasis, most commonly originating from lung cancer, increases cancer morbidity and mortality. Although metastatic colonization is the rate-limiting and most complex step of the metastatic cascade, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening revealed that loss of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) promotes brain colonization of human lung cancer cells. Incipient brain metastatic cancer cells with high expression of IFITM1 secrete microglia-activating complement component 3 and enhance the cytolytic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by increasing the expression and membrane localization of major histocompatibility complex class I. After activation, microglia (of the innate immune system) and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (of the adaptive immune system) were found to jointly eliminate cancer cells by releasing interferon-gamma and inducing phagocytosis and T-cell-mediated killing. In human cancer clinical trials, immune checkpoint blockade therapy response was significantly correlated with IFITM1 expression, and IFITM1 enhanced the brain metastasis suppression efficacy of PD-1 blockade in mice. Our results exemplify a novel mechanism through which metastatic cancer cells overcome the innate and adaptive immune responses to colonize the brain, and suggest that a combination therapy increasing IFITM1 expression in metastatic cells with PD-1 blockade may be a promising strategy to reduce metastasis.
