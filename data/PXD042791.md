### Title
Egg and liver proteome in vtg2 knocked-out zebrafish females

### Description
CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out of the vtg1 and vtg3 genes was performed in zebrafish separately. This project involves proteomics screening for validation of the absence of targeted proteins in vtg1 and vtg3 and their variants in knocked out female zebrafish in eggs and investigating possible changes within the corresponding proteomes as a results of the absence of these specific vitellogenins and their variants.

### Sample Protocol
Egg and liver proteins were stacked in a NUPAGE Bis-Tris gel (ThermoFisher Scientific) and bands were excised and digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) for analysis by mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap instrument (LTQ-OrbitrpXL, Thermo Scientific) on Protim platform (https://www.protim.eu/, Rennes, France) as previously described (Yilmaz et al., 2017, PMID: 29145436).
