### Title
Proteomic changes in sweet cherry fruit (cv. ‘Tsolakeika’) in response to calcium application.

### Description
The experiment was performed in a commercial sweet cherry (cv. Tsolakeika, Prunus avium L.) orchard in North Greece (Edessa) during 2017 growing season. The orchard contained 10-years old trees, planted at 5x5 m spacing between rows and along the row, grafted onto Mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb L.) rootstock, trained in open vase and subjected to standard cultural practices. Three foliar sprays (0.5% or 35 mM CaCl2) were performed at 15, 27 and 37 days after full blossom (DAFB). Cherry fruits (exocarp plus mesocarp tissues) were sampled in two developmental stages, namely at full red color (44 DAFB, S4 stage) and at commercial harvest (55 DAFB, S5 stage). Three biological replicates of 20-fruit sub-lots in control and Ca-treated fruits were frozen in liquid nitrogen, grinding in fine powder and stored at -80 ⁰C for proteomic processing.

### Sample Protocol
Three foliar sprays (0.5% or 35 mM CaCl2) were performed at 15, 27 and 37 days after full blossom (DAFB). After 2 days of each calcium application (17, 29 and 39 DAFB, respectively) fruit samples of control and treated cherries were collected. In addition, cherry fruits were sampled in another two developmental stages, specifically at full red color (44 DAFB, S4) and at commercial harvest (55 DAFB, S5).  At S4 and S5 stages 3 biological replicates of 20-fruit sub-lots (exocarp-mesocarp tissue) in control and treated cherries frozen in liquid nitrogen, grinding in fine powder and stored at -80 ⁰C. Protein was extracted through a phenol-based extraction protocol. Total proteins were extracted from 4 g of each homogenized sample with 5 mL extraction buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 30% saccharoze, and Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (Tanou et al., 2009). An equal volume of phenol-Tris saturated was added and the protein extracts were stirred for 20min at 4◦C and centrifuged at 15000 g for 10min at 4◦C. Following the phenolic phase collection, a 5:1 cold 0.1 M ammonium acetate (dissolved in methanol) was added and the samples kept at −20◦C overnight. After centrifugation (10000 g, 10min, 4◦C), the precipitated protein pellet was washed one time with ice-cold ammonium acetate, three times with ice-cold 70% acetone and subsequently was dried at a Thermoblock (Thermo Block 780).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed and quantified by the normalized LFQ (Label Free Quantitation) in MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0), using search against the P. avium protein database with 43673 entries (PAV_v1.0) in FASTA-format (from ftp.bioinfo.wsu.edu). Search parameters included a molecular weight ranging from 350 to 5,000 Da, a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, an MS/MS fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da, a maximum of two missed cleavages by trypsin, and methionine oxidation, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethyl was set as fixed cysteine modification. The protein and peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1%. The match-between-run function was enabled. Label-free quantification was carried out in MaxQuant and protein abundance was calculated on the basis of their normalized spectral protein intensity (Label Free Quantitation-LFQ).
