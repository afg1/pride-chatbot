### Title
Effect of low levels of fluoride in the islets of NOD mice: integrative morphological, immunohistochemical and proteomic analyses

### Description
Fluoride (F) is used in dentistry, in therapeutic doses, to prevent dental caries. Recently, animal studies have suggested that in low doses, F might reduce glucose and be beneficial in the prophylaxis of diabetes, but the involved mechanisms are still unknown. The present study evaluated changes in the pancreatic islets of NOD mice exposed to low dose of F, using morphological, immunohistochemical and proteomic tools.

### Sample Protocol
Forty female NOD mice were randomly divided into two groups, taking into account the F concentration administered in the drinking water ad libitum for 14 weeks: 0 (control) or 10 mg/L. After the experimental period, the pancreas was collected for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis and the islets for proteomic analysis.

### Data Protocol
The Xevo G2 (Waters) mass spectrometer coupled to the nanoACQUITY (Waters) system for the peptide analysis and Protein Lynx Global Server (PLGS) version 3.03 software was used to process and search for continuous LC-MSE data, as previously reported. Peptides were identified using the software's ion counting algorithm and a search on the updated Mus musculus database (UniProtKB). The PLGS detected difference in expression between the groups, expressed as p<0.05 and 1-p>0.95 for down- and up-regulated proteins, respectively.
