### Title
Constitutive Protein Kinase G Activation Exacerbates Stress-induced Cardiomyopathy

### Description
:  Heart failure is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and new therapeutic targets are needed. Preclinical data suggest that pharmacological activation of protein kinase G (PKG) can reduce maladaptive ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in the stressed heart.  However, clinical trial results have been mixed, and the effects of long-term PKG activation in the heart are unknown.

### Sample Protocol
We characterized the cardiac phenotype of mice carrying a heterozygous knock-in mutation of PKG1 (Prkg1R177Q/+), which causes constitutive, cGMP-independent activation of the kinase.  We examined isolated cardiac myocytes and intact mice, the latter after stress induced by surgical transaortic constriction or angiotensin II infusion.   Key Results: Cardiac myocytes from Prkg1R177Q/+ mice showed altered phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins and reduced contractility in response to electrical stimulation, compared to cells from wild type mice.  Under resting conditions, young PKG1R177Q/+ mice exhibited no obvious cardiac abnormalities, but aging animals developed mild increases in cardiac fibrosis.  In response to angiotensin II infusion or fixed pressure overload induced by transaortic constriction, young  PKGR177Q/+ mice developed exacerbated hypertrophic remodeling with increased fibrosis and myocyte apoptosis, leading to worse left ventricular dilation and dysfunction compared to wild type litter mates.
