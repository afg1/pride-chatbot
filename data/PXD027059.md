### Title
Coccolith Associated Proteins from Emiliania huxleyi

### Description
Identification of proteins asssociated with coccoliths isolated from Emiliania huxleyi.

### Sample Protocol
Coccoliths of Emiliania huxleyi strain 1516 (from AWI) were islolated and protease treated, and washed extensively with SDS before being dissolved with EDTA. Material solubalized by this procedure was subject to deglycosylation. Samples were either run on SDS-PAGE and bands excised for proteomics, or in-solution digests were performed using a variety of enzymes.

### Data Protocol
Searches were performed using comet and MASCOT, and post-processed using the Trans Proteomic Pipeline.
