### Title
Microbial remineralization of particulate organic carbon in the oceanâ€™s twilight zone

### Description
we characterized the microbial communities and proteomes of POC collected from the twilight zone at three contrasting sites in the northwest Pacific Ocean using a metaproteomic approach.Particle-attached bacteria, Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales and Enterobacteriales, were the major remineralizers of POC in the twilight zone.

### Sample Protocol
1.Field survey and sampling 2.The 16S rRNA sequence analysis. 3.Protein extraction, separation and LC-ESI-MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS spectra were searched against Tara Ocean database for protein quantification using MaxQuant (30) (15) . The peptide and protein identification and quantification from the mass spectrometry raw data were performed using the MetaPro-IQ approach, as previously described.
