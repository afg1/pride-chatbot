### Title
Glycation modulates glutamatergic signaling and exacerbates ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease-like phenotypes

### Description
Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a central player in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies due to its accumulation in typical protein aggregates in the brain. However, it is still unclear how it contributes to neurodegeneration. Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (PD) and, interestingly, a common molecular alteration among these disorders is the age-associated increase in protein glycation. We hypothesized that glycation-induced neuronal dysfunction might be a contributing factor in synucleinopathies. Here, we dissected the specific impact of methylglyoxal (MGO, a glycating agent) in mice overexpressing aSyn in the brain. We found that MGO-glycation potentiates motor, cognitive, olfactory, and colonic dysfunction in aSyn transgenic (Thy1-aSyn) mice that received a single dose of MGO via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. aSyn accumulates in the midbrain, striatum, and prefrontal cortex, and protein glycation is increased in the cerebellum and midbrain. SWATH mass spectrometry analysis, used to quantify changes in the brain proteome, revealed that MGO mainly increase glutamatergic-associated proteins in the midbrain (NMDA, AMPA, glutaminase, VGLUT and EAAT1), but not in the prefrontal cortex, where it mainly affects the electron transport chain. Notably, the glycated proteins in the midbrain of Thy1-aSyn mice that received MGO strongly correlate with PD and dopaminergic pathways. Overall, we demonstrated that MGO-induced glycation accelerates PD-like sensorimotor and cognitive alterations and suggest that the increase of glutamatergic signaling may underly these events. Our study sheds new light into the enhanced vulnerability of the midbrain in PD-related synaptic dysfunction and suggests that glycation suppressors and anti-glutamatergic drugs may hold promise as disease-modifying therapies for synucleinopathies.

### Sample Protocol
Age-matched 16 weeks old, male transgenic Thy1-aSyn and WT littermates mice received MGO (5 Ã‚ÂµL at 31.6 mM), or vehicle (PBS, pH 7.4) ICV injection under deep anesthesia into the right lateral ventricle. Three weeks post-injection, mice were sacrificed, brains were collected, and the left hemisphere was dissected (midbrain and cortex) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) analysis. Eighty micrograms of each sample were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (BioUltra, Sigma) for 45 min at 56 Ã‚Â°C, alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide (BioUltra, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then precipitated with acetone (HPLC Plus, Sigma) overnight at -20 Ã‚Â°C. The dried sample was resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (BioUltra, Sigma) and digested overnight at 37 Ã‚Â°C with trypsin (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega) in a 1:50 trypsin:sample ratio. A second digestion was performed for 3 h at 37 Ã‚Â°C, by adding trypsin in a 1:100 trypsin:sample ratio with 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific). The sample was dried on a SpeedVac (ThermoSavant Scientific) and resuspended in 5 % Formic acid (Optima LC/MS grade, Fisher Scientific) to perform peptide cleanup using C18 microcolumns (OMIX C18 pipette tips, Agilent), and then dried again. Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis was performed on an ekspertÃ¢â€žÂ¢ NanoLC 425 cHiPLC system coupled with a TripleTOF 6600 with a NanoSpray III source (Sciex Framingham, US). Peptides were sprayed into the MS through an uncoated fused-silica PicoTipÃ¢â€žÂ¢ emitter (360 Ã‚Âµm O.D., 20 Ã‚Âµm I.D., 10 Ã‚Â± 1.0 Ã‚Âµm tip I.D., New Objective, Oullins, France). The source parameters were set as follows: 15 GS1, 0 GS2, 30 CUR, 2.5 keV ISVF, and 100 Ã¢ï¿½Â°C IHT. Peptides were separated through reversed-phase chromatography (RP-LC) in a trap-and-elute mode. Trapping was performed at 2 Ã‚ÂµL/min on a NanoLC Trap column (Eksigent 350 Ã‚Âµm x 0.5 mm, ChromXP C18-CL, 3 Ã‚Âµm, 120 Ãƒâ€¦) with 100% A (0.1% formic acid in water, Fisher Chemicals, Geel, Belgium) for 10 min. The separation was performed at 300 nL/min, on a NanoLC column (Eksigent 75 Ã‚Âµm x 15 cm, ChromXP 3C18-CL-120, 3 Ã‚Âµm, 120 Ãƒâ€¦). The gradient was as follows: 0-1 min, 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, Fisher Chemicals, Geel, Belgium); 1-91 min, 5-30% B; 91-93 min, 30-80% B; 93-108 min, 80% B; 108-110 min, 80-5% B; 110-127 min, 5% B. The samples used to generate the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH)-MS spectral library were subjected to IDA using three different MS m/z ranges, which were calculated using the SWATH Variable Window Calculator V1.0 (Sciex, Framingham, US) based on a reference sample. The mass range for MS scan was set to m/z 400Ã¢â‚¬â€œ614.9, 613.9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ791.7, and 790.7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2,000. The MS/MS scan mass range was uniformly set to m/z 150Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1,800. Following a TOF-MS survey scan (250 msec accumulation time), the 50 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation and the MS/MS were acquired in high sensitivity mode for 40 msec, for a total cycle time of 2.3 s. The selection criteria for parent ions included an intensity of greater than 125 cps and a charge state ranging from +2 to +5. Once an ion had been fragmented through MS/MS, its mass was excluded from further MS/MS fragmentation for 12 s. The ions were fragmented in the collision cell using rolling collision energy, and CES was set to 5. Biological replicates (individual animals) were pooled to perform the IDA runs. Therefore, the 24 IDA MS raw files were combined and subjected to database searches in unison using ProteinPilot software v. 5.0 (Sciex, Framingham, US) with the Paragon algorithm to generate the Spectral Library. A UniProt reviewed database (17,032 entries, accessed on 16/10/2019) containing the sequences of Mus musculus was used. The following search parameters were set: Cys alkylation: Iodoacetamide; Met oxidation; lys glycation: Argpyrimidine [Nd-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimi- dine-2-yl)-l-ornithine], hydroimidazolones [Nd-(5-meth- yl-imidazolone-2-yl)-ornithine, isomers and oxidation products] and Nd-(4-carboxy-4,6-dimethyl-5,6-dihydr- oxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2-yl)ornithine and, N-ÃŽÂµ-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), and general modifications. Digestion: Trypsin; Instrument: TripleTOF 6600; ID focus: Biological modifications and Amino acid substitutions; Search effort: Thorough; FDR analysis: Yes. Only the proteins with <1% FDR were considered.

### Data Protocol
Five biological replicates from each condition were analyzed by SWATH-MS, using the instrument setup described for the IDA runs. The mass spectrometer was set to operate in cyclic data-independent acquisition (DIA), similarly to the previously established method (Gillet et al., 2012). SWATH-MS data were acquired using the SWATH acquisition method, applying a set of 64 overlapping variable SWATH windows covering the precursor mass range of 400Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2,000 m/z. The variable SWATH windows were calculated using the SWATH Variable Window Calculator V1.0 (Sciex, Framingham, US) based on the same reference sample. At the beginning of each cycle, a 10 ms survey scan (400-2,000 m/z) was acquired, and the subsequent SWATH windows were collected from 150 to 1,800 m/z for 50 ms, resulting in a cycle time of 3.26 s. The collision energy for each window was set using rolling collision energy, and CES was set to 5. Data processing was performed using the SWATH processing plug-in for PeakView 2.2 (Sciex, Framingham, MA USA). In brief, peptides were selected from the library using the following criteria: i) the unique peptides for each protein were ranked by the precursor ion intensity from the IDA runs as estimated by the ProteinPilot software: ii) shared peptides (peptides that shared the same amino acid sequence between different protein entries) were excluded from selection. Up to 6 peptides were chosen per protein, and SWATH quantification was attempted for all proteins in the library file that were identified below 1% Global FDR from fit from ProteinPilot searches (which corresponded to a peptide confidence threshold of 98%). Target fragment ions, up to 6, were automatically selected. Manual inspection was performed for random peptides to check the quality of the auto selection and fragment ions were edited accordingly. Peak group confidence threshold was determined based on an FDR analysis using the target-decoy approach, and extraction FDR threshold was set to 1%. Peptides that met the 1% FDR threshold in all the five replicates were retained. The peak areas of the fragment ions were extracted using an XIC window of 6 minutes, and an XIC width of 20 ppm. Data were directly exported to Markerview 1.3.1 (Sciex, Framingham, MA USA) and normalized using total area sums to obtain the final quantification values. MarkerView was also used to perform the PCA and t-test statistical tests. An outlier removal approach was executed using GraphPad Prism Version 9, using iterative GrubbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s using Alpha = 0.2. Missing values were replaced using average values from the corresponding group of samples. Protein intensities were then divided by the number of theoretically observable peptides between 6 and 30 amino acids, neglecting missed cleavages, to obtain normalized intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values. The log2(x + 1) transformed iBAQ values were quantile normalization using the R function Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalize.quantilesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The normalized values were subjected to statistical analysis utilizing R package limma where different contrast were specified. Correction for multiple testing was applied using the method of Benjamini & Hochberg. The peptides with MGO-derived AGEs and the corresponding proteins were identified in the midbrain of all experimental groups. Venn diagrams were used to identify proteins uniquely glycated in the Thy1-aSyn mice injected with MGO.
