### Title
Apoptotic brown adipocytes enhance energy expenditure via SLC29A1-regulated extracellular inosine

### Description
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy and promotes cardio-metabolic health4. However, loss of BAT during obesity and aging is a principal hurdle for BAT-centered obesity therapies. So far not much is known about BAT apoptosis and signals released by apoptotic brown adipocytes. Here, untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that apoptotic brown adipocytes release a specific pattern of metabolites with purine metabolites being highly enriched. Interestingly, this apoptotic secretome enhances expression of the thermogenic program in healthy adipocytes to maintain tissue functionality. This effect is mediated by the purine inosine which stimulates energy expenditure (EE) in brown adipocytes. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway and of pro-thermogenic transcription factors by inosine.

### Sample Protocol
Phosphopeptides were enriched using the Easyphos workflow (Humphrey et al. 2018) with 1mg of protein input. For MS analysis peptides were loaded onto a 50-cm column at 60 °C with a 75µM inner diameter, packed in-house with 1.9 µM C18 ReproSil particles (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptides were separated on a 120 min gradient by reversed phase chromatography using a binary buffer system consisting of 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and 80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid (buffer B). MS spectra were acquired on a Thermo Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. Acquisition was performed using a data-dependent 1 sec cycle time method with a maximum injection time of 80 ms, a scan range of 300–1650 Th, and an AGC target of 300% without FAIMS. Sequencing was performed via higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation with a target value of 1e5, and a window of 1.4 Th. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000. Resolution for HCD spectra was set to 15,000 with a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 40 s, and apex trigger was enabled

### Data Protocol
Raw mass spectrometry data was processed with MaxQuant version 2.0.1.0 with “match between runs” enabled. “Max. missed cleavages” were set to 2. Default settings were used if not stated otherwise. Statistical analysis and imputation of missing values was performed with Perseus software.

### Publication Abstract
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy<sup>1,2</sup> and promotes cardiometabolic health<sup>3</sup>. Loss of BAT during obesity and ageing is a principal hurdle for BAT-centred obesity therapies, but not much is known about BAT apoptosis. Here, untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that apoptotic brown adipocytes release a specific pattern of metabolites with purine metabolites being highly enriched. This apoptotic secretome enhances expression of the thermogenic programme in healthy adipocytes. This effect is mediated by the purine inosine that stimulates energy expenditure in brown adipocytes by the cyclic adenosine&#xa0;monophosphate-protein kinase A signalling pathway. Treatment of mice with inosine increased BAT-dependent energy expenditure and induced 'browning' of white adipose tissue. Mechanistically, the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1, SLC29A1) regulates inosine levels in BAT: ENT1-deficiency increases extracellular inosine levels and consequently enhances thermogenic adipocyte differentiation. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 as well as global and adipose-specific ablation enhanced BAT activity and counteracted diet-induced obesity, respectively. In human brown adipocytes, knockdown or blockade of ENT1 increased extracellular inosine, which enhanced thermogenic capacity. Conversely, high ENT1 levels correlated with lower expression of the thermogenic marker UCP1 in human adipose tissues. Finally, the Ile216Thr loss of function mutation in human ENT1 was associated with significantly lower body mass index and 59% lower odds of obesity for individuals carrying the Thr variant. Our data identify inosine as a metabolite released during apoptosis with a 'replace me' signalling function that regulates thermogenic fat and counteracts obesity.
