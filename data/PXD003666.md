### Title
TFMI-3 plasma pull-down -  MASP-3 is the exclusive pro-factor D activator in resting blood: the lectin and the alternative complement pathways are fundamentally linked

### Description
MASP-3 is the third protease of the lectin pathway of the complement system, but its biological function has remained obscure. To elucidate its role in complement activation, we developed a specific MASP-3 inhibitor (named TFMI-3). In this work we unambiguously demonstrate that MASP-3 acts as the exclusive pro-FD activator in resting blood.

### Sample Protocol
HA-tagged TFMI fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogenity. Peripheral blood was drawn from a healthy donor using hirudin as anticoagulant. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation immediately after venesection and stored at -80°C until analysis.  Twenty microliter plasma and 1.75 ug TFMI-3_HA were incubated in 500 ul PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The same amount of plasma without the inhibitor served as absolute control. A modified inhibitor harboring a point mutation (TFMI-3_K135E_HA) eliminating MASP-3 binding function was also incubated with plasma and used to detect putative protein-protein interactions unrelated to MASP-3 (specific control). Next, 50 ul anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce) were added and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were collected, intensively washed, and bound proteins were eluted with two subsequent incubations with 100 ul HA-peptide (Pierce) for 5 min and 90 min, respectively. The eluates were concentrated separately using a Vivaspin 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) and precipitated using methanol/chloroform.The same experiment was repeated with normal pooled citrated plasma leading to the same results.

### Data Protocol
Precipitated proteins were subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis performed on an UltiMate® 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by a nano-spray ion source. All acquired spectra were processed and analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.1) and the human-specific Swiss-Prot database (rel. 2015/11/11) manually complemented with entries corresponding to all alternative splice products of the MASP-1 and 2 genes (including MASP-3) missing from the original database. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM. Carboxymethyl of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of methionine were specified as variable modifications. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.4.8, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 80.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A et al Anal. Chem. 2002;74(20):5383-92) with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Al et al Anal. Chem. 2003;75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.

### Publication Abstract
MASP-3 was discovered 15 years ago as the third mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease of the complement lectin pathway. Lacking any verified substrate its role remained ambiguous. MASP-3 was shown to compete with a key lectin pathway enzyme MASP-2 for MBL binding, and was therefore considered to be a negative complement regulator. Later, knock-out mice experiments suggested that MASP-1 and/or MASP-3 play important roles in complement pro-factor D (pro-FD) maturation. However, studies on a MASP-1/MASP-3-deficient human patient produced contradicting results. In normal resting blood unperturbed by ongoing coagulation or complement activation, factor D is present predominantly in its active form, suggesting that resting blood contains at least one pro-FD activating proteinase that is not a direct initiator of coagulation or complement activation. We have recently showed that all three MASPs can activate pro-FD in vitro. In resting blood, however, using our previously evolved MASP-1 and MASP-2 inhibitors we proved that neither MASP-1 nor MASP-2 activates pro-FD. Other plasma proteinases, particularly MASP-3, remained candidates for that function. For this study we evolved a specific MASP-3 inhibitor and unambiguously proved that activated MASP-3 is the exclusive pro-FD activator in resting blood, which demonstrates a fundamental link between the lectin and alternative pathways.
