### Title
Proteomic analysis of two populations of Schistosoma mansoni-derived extracellular vesicles: exosome-like vesicles and microvesicles

### Description
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been characterized from many species of parasitic helminths, and recent experimental evidence supports important functions for their cargo in host-parasite relationships. Here, we carried out a detailed proteomic analysis of two populations of EVs – exosome like vesicles (ELVs) and microvesicles (MVs) – from Schistosoma mansoni. We profiled the proteins present in these EVs (including external trypsin-liberated peptides, cargo proteins, integral membrane proteins (IMPs) and peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) using LC-MS/MS.

### Sample Protocol
EVs were isolated from the excretory/secretory products from S. mansoni. Sequencing-grade trypsin (1 µg/µl) was added to purified EVs for 10 min at 37°C to release peptides from surface-accessible proteins. Treated EVs were then centrifuged at 120,000 g at 4°C for 1 h, and surface peptides were obtained from the supernatant. EVs collected as a pellet were further processed to investigate proteins associated with the EV membrane and within the EV lumen. In short, EVs were resuspended in water and sonicated (3x) which resulted in the release of EV cargo content which was recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 120,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. Then, the pellet was incubated with 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 11) on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 120,000 g at 4°C for 1 h to recover peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) from the supernatant. Finally, integral membrane proteins (IMPs) were obtained by solubilizing the pellet in 1% Triton X-100/2% sodium dodecyl sulphate at 37°C for 15 min. For the proteomic analysis, each separated component of cargo, peripheral membrane and integral membrane proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for 60 min at 140 V. For tryptic in-gel digestion, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue (0.03%), destained overnight and each lane was cut into 7 slices. Each band was destained by washing twice in 50% acetonitrile with 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 45 min, reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 65°C, alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 15 min and digested with 100 ng/µl trypsin at 37°C for 18 h. Peptides were extracted in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All peptides were finally dried in a vacuum concentrator. Samples were then resuspended in 10 µl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and tryptic peptides were desalted using a Zip-Tip® column pipette tip and dried in a vacuum concentrator before analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  For LC-MS/MS submission of sample, tryptic fragments from each sample were resuspended in 8 µl of 0.1 % formic acid in LC-MS/MS-grade water and separated chromatographically by an Eksigent nanoLC 415 system using a 15 cm long Eksigent column (C18-CL particle size 3 μm, 120 Å, 75 μm ID) and a linear gradient of 3-40% solvent B (100 acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid [aq]) for 45 min followed by 40-80 % solvent B in 5 min. A pre-concentration step (10 min) was performed employing an Eksigent Trap-column (C18-CL, 3 μm, 120 Å, 350 μm x 0.5 mm) before commencement of the gradient. A flow rate of 300 nl/min was used for all experiments. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid [aq]) and solvent B. Eluates from the RP-HPLC column were directly introduced into the PicoView ESI ionisation source of a TripleTOF 6600 MS/MS System operated in positive ion electrospray mode. All analyses were performed using Information Dependant Acquisition AnalystTF 1.7.1.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched against a database comprising the S. mansoni proteome obtained from WormBase ParaSite (http://parasite.wormbase.org/) appended to the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP; http://www.thegpm.org/crap/) and their reversed decoy sequences using SearchGUI (v3.3.5). Comet (v2018.01 rev.2), X!Tandem (vAlanin), MyriMatch (v2.1), Tide (v3.2.x) and MS-GF + (v2016.01.02) were the search engines used, and the identification results were validated using PeptideShaker (v1.16.31). All searches were performed employing the following search parameters: trypsin as digestion enzyme, maximum missed cleavages, 2; precursor ion mass tolerance ± 10 ppm, fragment ion tolerance ±0.1 Da; fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine; variable modifications: deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine; Peptide Spectrum Matches, peptides and proteins were validated at a 1.0% False Discovery Rate estimated using the decoy hit distribution. Reported results correspond to those proteins showing ≥ 2 distinct unique peptides. An estimate of the relative abundance of the predicted proteins was assessed using the spectrum counting abundance index together with sequence coverage and detected peptides numbers.

### Publication Abstract
Helminth parasites secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) into their environment that have potential roles in host-parasite communication, and thus represent potentially useful targets for novel control strategies. Here, we carried out a comprehensive proteomic analysis of two different populations of EVs - 15k pellet and 120k pellet EVs - from Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. We characterised the proteins present in the membranes of the EVs (including external trypsin-liberated peptides, integral membrane proteins (IMPs) and peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs)), as well as cargo proteins, using LC-MS/MS. A total of 286 and 716 proteins were identified in 15k and 120k pellets, respectively. Some of the most abundant proteins identified from both 15k and 120k pellets include known vaccine candidates such as Sm-TSP-2, saponin B domain-containing proteins, calpain glutathione-S-transferase, Sm29 and cathepsin domain-containing proteins. Other abundant proteins that have not been tested as vaccines include DM9 domain-containing protein, 13&#x2009;kDa tegumental antigen and histone H4-like protein. Sm23, a member of the tetraspanin family with known vaccine efficacy, was identified in the cargo and IMP compartments of only 15k pellet vesicles. Moreover, a collection of proteins with known or potential relevance in host-parasite communication including proteases, antioxidants and EV biogenesis/trafficking of both vesicle types were identified. Our results provide the first report of a comprehensive compartmental proteomic analysis of adult S. mansoni-derived EVs. Future research should investigate recombinant forms of these proteins as vaccine and serodiagnostic antigens as well as the roles of EV proteins in host-parasite communication.
