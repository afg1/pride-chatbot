### Title
HLA-DR15 Molecules Jointly Shape an Autoreactive T Cell Repertoire in Multiple Sclerosis

### Description
Autoimmune diseases are often associated with HLA molecules. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototypical example with the HLA-DR15 haplotype as strongest genetic factor. How it contributes to MS is not clear, but key to understand this and other autoimmune diseases. Autoreactive CD4+ T cells and proinflammatory B cells are central pathogenetic factors, and since HLA-DR molecules present peptides to CD4+ T cells, we characterized the peptidomes of the two HLA-DR15 allomorphs DR2a and DR2b on B cells. Self-peptides from HLA-DR α- and β-chains themselves are abundantly presented on B cells. We identified autoreactive CD4+ T cell clones, which recognize HLA-DR-derived self-peptides and peptides from the MS-related infectious agents EBV and Akkermansia and the autoantigen RAS guanyl-releasing protein 2. Our data demonstrate how the two MS-associated HLA-DR15 allomorphs function as antigen-presenting structures and source of peptides during peripheral maintenance of autoreactive T cells and activation by MS-associated pathogens.

### Sample Protocol
For peptidome analysis, cryopreserved PBMCs from HLA-DR15+ donors were thawed and washed twice with serum-free X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza). B cells and monocytes were isolated by positive selection using CD19 microbeads, human (Miltenyi Biotec) and CD14 microbeads, human (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, respectively. HLA molecules were extracted from blood B cells and monocytes through immunoaffinity chromatography using allele-specific antibodies against two HLA-DR15 allomorphs, DR2a and DR2b. Subsequently eluted HLA ligands were separated using reversed-phase ultra high performance liquid chromatography (nanoUHPLC, UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex) and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in an on-line coupled LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
For MS data analysis the Proteome discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Database search and spectral annotation was performed against the human proteome as comprised in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database via the SequestHT algorithm. Mass tolerance for processing was set to 5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. Only oxidized methionine was allowed as a dynamic modification and no cleavage specificity was selected. Peptide confidence was determined using the percolator algorithm with a target value of q ≤ 0.05 (5% FDR). After processing further filters for search engine rank (= 1) and peptide length (= 8-25 amino acids) were applied.

### Publication Abstract
The HLA-DR15 haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), but our understanding of how it contributes to MS is limited. Because autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cells and B cells as antigen-presenting cells are involved in MS pathogenesis, we characterized the immunopeptidomes of the two HLA-DR15 allomorphs DR2a and DR2b of human primary B cells and monocytes, thymus, and MS brain tissue. Self-peptides from HLA-DR molecules, particularly from DR2a and DR2b themselves, are abundant on B cells and thymic antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, we identified autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cell clones that can cross-react with HLA-DR-derived self-peptides (HLA-DR-SPs), peptides from MS-associated foreign agents (Epstein-Barr virus and Akkermansia muciniphila), and autoantigens presented by DR2a and DR2b. Thus, both HLA-DR15 allomorphs jointly shape an autoreactive T&#xa0;cell repertoire by serving as antigen-presenting structures and epitope sources and by presenting the same foreign peptides and autoantigens to autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T&#xa0;cells in MS.
