### Publication Abstract
Ophiobolin A (OPA) is a sesterterpenoid fungal natural product with broad anti-cancer activity. While OPA possesses multiple electrophilic moieties that can covalently react with nucleophilic amino acids on proteins, the proteome-wide targets and mechanism of OPA remain poorly understood in many contexts. In this study, we used covalent chemoproteomic platforms to map the proteome-wide reactivity of OPA in a highly sensitive lung cancer cell line. Among several proteins that OPA engaged, we focused on two targets-cysteine C53 of HIG2DA and lysine K72 of COX5A-that are part of complex IV of the electron transport chain and contributed significantly to the anti-proliferative activity. OPA activated mitochondrial respiration in a HIG2DA and COX5A-dependent manner, led to an initial spike in mitochondrial ATP, but then compromised mitochondrial membrane potential leading to ATP depletion. We have used chemoproteomic strategies to discover a unique anti-cancer mechanism of OPA through activation of complex IV leading to compromised mitochondrial energetics and rapid cell death.
