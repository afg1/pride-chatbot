### Title
Partner of Yeast Telomerase TLC1 RNA (TLC1)

### Description
Identification of yeast telomerase protein composition.

### Sample Protocol
immunopurification of TLC1-MS2 partners trough MS2-ProA by IgG beads. Untagged TLC1 used as negative control.

### Data Protocol
We used MaxQuant for analysis Specific proteins are those that are present in at least 2 mass spectrometry-IPs and identified exclusively in the TLC1-MS2 sample. These were then sorted by averaged peak intensity.
