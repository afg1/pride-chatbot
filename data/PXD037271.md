### Title
CRC proteomic analysis by LC MS/MS

### Description
analysis of fecal samples in colorectal cancer Egyptians patients

### Sample Protocol
Fresh fecal samples were collected from the participants; each participant provide one sample immediately sub-packed and marked. A sterile toothpick used to intercept the middle part of the sample, and then were stored at -80ËšC

### Data Protocol
The detected proteins are searched according to gene ontology (GO) annotations to study their biological function, their role in bacterial pathogenesis and lastly to determine the effect of the proteins on the immune system using the UniProtKB database (www.uniprot.org). Potential protein pathways were identified using the KEGG database
