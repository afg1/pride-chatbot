### Title
SARS-CoV-2 detection from clinical samples

### Description
Shotgun analysis of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples previously characterized by RT-PCR.

### Sample Protocol
Upper respiratory specimens (pooled to prevent patient identification) were processed by a modified SP3 protocols as described at doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19925-0.

### Data Protocol
Data processed as described at doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19925-0.

### Publication Abstract
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pressing public health systems around the world, and large population testing is a key step to control this pandemic disease. Here, we develop a high-throughput targeted proteomics assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein peptides directly from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. A modified magnetic particle-based proteomics approach implemented on a robotic liquid handler enables fully automated preparation of 96 samples within 4&#x2009;hours. A TFC-MS system allows multiplexed analysis of 4 samples within 10&#x2009;min, enabling the processing of more than 500 samples per day. We validate this method qualitatively (Tier 3) and quantitatively (Tier 1) using 985 specimens previously analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, and detect up to 84% of the positive cases with up to 97% specificity. The presented strategy has high sample stability and should be considered as an option for SARS-CoV-2 testing in large populations.
