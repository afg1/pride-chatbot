### Title
Mouse,GC-1,TMT（Tandem Mass Tag）tag quantification

### Description
Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) technology is an in vitro peptide labeling technique developed by Thermo Fisher Scientific, a peptide labeling technology developed in vitro. The technology uses six (TMTsixplex™ Isobaric Label Reagent Set) or 10 (TMT10plex™ Isobaric Label Reagent Set) isotope labels by labeling peptide specific amino acid sites. In TMT experiments, the relative and absolute amounts of proteins in up to 10 different samples can be compared flexibly by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In TMT experiments, whole proteins from tissue cells are obtained by protein extraction, and the whole proteins are enzymatically cleaved into peptides by trypsin, and the TMT reagents are used to label all the obtained peptides. The TMT reagent consists of three main components: a reporter group, an equilibrium group and a peptide reaction group.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction, protein quantitative gel running, protein digestion, pre-mass spectrometry, database comparison, and pre-experiment report.

### Data Protocol
The TMT peptide labeling, labeling efficiency, grading, mass spectrometry, database comparison, bioinformatics analysis and final report are performed on the samples that pass the quality control.
