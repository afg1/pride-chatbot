### Title
Pithovirus particle proteome -  Thirty-thousand-year-old distant relative of giant icosahedral DNA viruses with a pandoravirus morphology

### Description
Proteomic analysis of purified Pithovirus particles. The virus was grown in A. castellanii amobea before being purified. Viral particules were enriched after centrifugation and proteins solubilised by SDS before being stacked in the top of a SDS-PAGE gel. After in-gel digestion, resulting peptides were injected for a 120min nanoLC-MS/MS analysis using an Ultimate U3000 system and a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos pro hybrid mass spectrometer (Top 20).Data processing and bioinformatics: Data were processed automatically using Mascot Daemon software (version 2.3.2, Matrix Science). Concomitant searches against Pithovirus and A. castellanii protein sequence databanks as well as classical contaminants database and the corresponding reversed databases were performed using Mascot (version 2.4). ESI-TRAP was chosen as the instrument, trypsin/P as the enzyme and 2 missed cleavage allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set respectively at 10 ppm and 0.6 Da. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: carbamidomethyl (C, fixed) acetyl (N-ter, variable), oxidation (M, variable) and deamidation (NQ, variable). The IRMa software (Dupierris et al., Bioinformatics, 2009, 25:1980-1, version 1.30.4) was used to filter the results: selection of rank 1 peptides, peptide identification FDR < 1% (as calculated by employing the reverse database strategy), and minimum of 1 specific peptide per identified protein group.

### Publication Abstract
The largest known DNA viruses infect Acanthamoeba and belong to two markedly different families. The Megaviridae exhibit pseudo-icosahedral virions up to 0.7 &#x3bc;m in diameter and adenine-thymine (AT)-rich genomes of up to 1.25 Mb encoding a thousand proteins. Like their Mimivirus prototype discovered 10 y ago, they entirely replicate within cytoplasmic virion factories. In contrast, the recently discovered Pandoraviruses exhibit larger amphora-shaped virions 1 &#x3bc;m in length and guanine-cytosine-rich genomes up to 2.8 Mb long encoding up to 2,500 proteins. Their replication involves the host nucleus. Whereas the Megaviridae share some general features with the previously described icosahedral large DNA viruses, the Pandoraviruses appear unrelated to them. Here we report the discovery of a third type of giant virus combining an even larger pandoravirus-like particle 1.5 &#x3bc;m in length with a surprisingly smaller 600 kb AT-rich genome, a gene content more similar to Iridoviruses and Marseillevirus, and a fully cytoplasmic replication reminiscent of the Megaviridae. This suggests that pandoravirus-like particles may be associated with a variety of virus families more diverse than previously envisioned. This giant virus, named Pithovirus sibericum, was isolated from a &gt;30,000-y-old radiocarbon-dated sample when we initiated a survey of the virome of Siberian permafrost. The revival of such an ancestral amoeba-infecting virus used as a safe indicator of the possible presence of pathogenic DNA viruses, suggests that the thawing of permafrost either from global warming or industrial exploitation of circumpolar regions might not be exempt from future threats to human or animal health.
