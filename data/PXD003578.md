### Title
Glycopeptide identification by LC-MS/MS

### Description
Automatic and rapid identification of glycopeptides by nano-uplc-ltq-ft-ms and proteomic search engine

### Sample Protocol
Trypsin digestion of standard glycoproteins, LC-MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
Searches were run using Byonic v2.6 (Protein Metrics)  against targeted and decoy databases. Search parameters included trypsin enzyme specificity, allowing for two missed cleavage sites, carbamidomethyl in cysteine as static modification and methionine oxidation and acetyl in protein N-terminus as dynamic modifications. The peptide mass tolerance was 10 ppm and the MS/MS tolerance was 0.6 Da. To avoid false positive identifications, only peptides with specific cleavage were considered. Peptide spectrum matches with an FDR < 1%, calculated from Log Prob scores, were considered positive identifications.
