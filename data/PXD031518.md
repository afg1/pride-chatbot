### Title
Classification of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Using Tumor Morphologic Characteristics

### Description
Despite the similar histologic appearances of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), clinical observations point to marked differences in their gross appearances. Some patients have numerous small nodules, whereas others have bulkier disease; some patients have widespread disease, whereas others have more localized disease. However, a systematic framework for classifying such gross morphologic differences does not exist. The implementation of a laparoscopic triage algorithm for patients with advanced HGSOC enabled us to prospectively obtain detailed video images of HGSOC that could be analyzed to identify morphologic subtypes.  In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize a gross morphologic classification system for HGSOC. Specifically, we assessed whether HGSOC can be reliably divided into distinct gross morphologic subtypes and whether such subtypes have different clinical outcomes and molecular features.

### Sample Protocol
Fifty-six frozen primary and metastatic tumor tissues from 32 patients diagnosed with HGSOC were prepared for and analyzed by quantitative MS-based proteomics. Briefly, whole tumor (tumor and stromal cells) collections were harvested by laser microdissection and samples underwent pressure-assisted digestion with trypsin employing a barocycler (2320EXT Pressure BioSciences, Inc). Ten micrograms of total peptide were labelled per tandem mass tag channel (TMTpro 16-plex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A reference channel was also included in each multiplex, which was generated by pooling equivalent amounts of peptide digests from each of the 56 cancer specimens. The TMT multiplexes were resolved offline by basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (1260 Infinity II liquid chromatograph, Agilent) into 24 pooled fractions. The pooled fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing a nanoflow LC system (EASY-nLC 1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online with a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). High resolution (R=60,000 at m/z 200) broadband (m/z 400-1600) mass spectra were acquired, followed by selection of the top 12 most intense molecular ions in each MS scan for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD).

### Data Protocol
Peptide and global protein-level identifications were generated by searching raw data files against a publicly-available, non-redundant human proteome database (Swiss-Prot, http://www.uniprot.org/) using Mascot (v2.6.0, Matrix Science), Proteome Discoverer (v2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and in-house tools.
