### Title
Proteomic analysis of bystander effects induced by irradiated chondrosarcoma cells

### Description
To understand the cellular response of bystander cells, we performed a 2D gel-based proteomic study of the chondrocyte receiving the conditioned medium of low dose irradiated chondrosarcoma cells. The proteomic analysis of the bystander chondrocytes highlighted 20 proteins spots that were significantly modified at low dose, implicating several cellular mechanisms, such as oxidative stress responses, cellular motility and exosomes pathways. Several of these candidates and cellular mechanisms were confirmed by functional analysis, such as 8-oxodG quantification, western blot and wound-healing migration tests.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from TC-28/Ac cells (dry pellet)in sample buffer containing 7 M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.05% Triton X100, 65 mM DTT, 40mM spermine, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. This suspension was centrifuged at 28000 rpm for 60 min, supernatants were collected and the protein content was estimated using the Bradford method [19]. Proteins were then precipitated using the 2D clean-up kit (GE Healthcare) and the pellet was solubilized with TUC solution (7M urea, 2M thiourea, 4% CHAPS) and quantified with the 2D quant kit (GE Healthcare). Proteins were resolved by 2D gel. Images from stained gels were analysed using the Samespots software v4.5 (Non-linear Dynamics, UK), and varaint proteins were analyzed by a Qexactive plus mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data was processed using the Proteome Discoverer software (Version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and the search engine employed in local was Mascot (version.2.4, Matrix Science, http://www.matrixscience.com).

### Publication Abstract
Besides the direct effects of radiations, indirect effects are observed within the surrounding non-irradiated area; irradiated cells relay stress signals in this close proximity, inducing the so-called radiation-induced bystander effect. These signals received by neighboring unirradiated cells induce specific responses similar with those of direct irradiated cells. To understand the cellular response of bystander cells, we performed a 2D gel-based proteomic study of the chondrocytes receiving the conditioned medium of low-dose irradiated chondrosarcoma cells. The conditioned medium was directly analyzed by mass spectrometry in order to identify candidate bystander factors involved in the signal transmission. The proteomic analysis of the bystander chondrocytes highlighted 20 proteins spots that were significantly modified at low dose, implicating several cellular mechanisms, such as oxidative stress responses, cellular motility, and exosomes pathways. In addition, the secretomic analysis revealed that the abundance of 40 proteins in the conditioned medium of 0.1 Gy irradiated chondrosarcoma cells was significantly modified, as compared with the conditioned medium of non-irradiated cells. A large cluster of proteins involved in stress granules and several proteins involved in the cellular response to DNA damage stimuli were increased in the 0.1 Gy condition. Several of these candidates and cellular mechanisms were confirmed by functional analysis, such as 8-oxodG quantification, western blot, and wound-healing migration tests. Taken together, these results shed new lights on the complexity of the radiation-induced bystander effects and the large variety of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, including the identification of a new potential actor, namely the stress granules.
