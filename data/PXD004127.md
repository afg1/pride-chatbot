### Title
quancat based proteomics identifies distinct patterns of protein synthesis induced by hypertrophic agents in cardiomyocytes

### Description
The aim of this project was to quantify the effects of different hypertrophic stimuli on synthesis of specific proteins in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes

### Sample Protocol
quancat was used to label and selectively enrich for newly synthesized proteins

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were submitted to proteome discoverer 1.4 for target decoy search using sequest

### Publication Abstract
