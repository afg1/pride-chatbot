### Title
Proteome analysis of the soybean nodule phosphorus response mechanism and characterisation of stress-induced ribosome structural and protein expression changes

### Description
In agroecosystems, a plant-usable form of nitrogen is mainly generated by legume-based biological nitrogen fixation, a process that requires phosphorus (P) as an essential nutrient. To investigate the physiological mechanism whereby phosphorus influences soybean nodule nitrogen fixation, soybean root nodules were exposed to four phosphate levels: 1 mg/L (P stress), 11 mg/L (P stress), 31 mg/L (Normal P), 61 mg/L (High P) then proteome analysis of nodules was conducted to identify phosphorus-associated proteome changes. We found that phosphorus stress-induced ribosomal protein structural changes were associated with altered key root nodule protein synthesis profiles. Importantly, up-regulated expression of peroxidase was observed as an important phosphorus stress-induced nitrogen fixation-associated adaptation that supported two nodule-associated activities: scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell wall growth. In addition, phosphorus transporter (PT) and purple acid phosphatase (PAPs) were up-regulated that regulated phosphorus transport and utilisation to maintain phosphorus balance and nitrogen fixation function in phosphorus-stressed root nodules.

MS spectra lists were searched against  their species-level UniProt FASTA databases (uniprot-Glycine max-3847-2021-3.fasta), with  Carbamidomethyl [C] , TMT 6 plex(K) and TMT 6 plex (N-term)as a fixed modification and Oxi- dation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) as variable modifications. Trypsin was used as  proteases. A maximum of 2 missed cleavage(s) was allowed. The false discovery rate (FDR)  was set to 0.01 for both PSM and peptide levels. Peptide identification was performed with an  initial precursor mass deviation of up to 10 ppm and a fragment mass deviation of 0.02Da .  Unique peptide and Razor peptide were used for protein quantification and total peptide  amount for normalization. All the other parameters were reserved as default.
