### Title
Phosphorylation of Primpol for repriming actiivity

### Description
SILAC-IP and mass spectrometric analysis of Primpol to determine phosphorylaton of a specific serine residue

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitated Primpol was purified, in-gel digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed via LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive Plus mass specrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched with Sequest, and results were assembled using Scaffold (version 4.3.2) where a minimum peptide probabilty of 95% was required for peptide identifications.
