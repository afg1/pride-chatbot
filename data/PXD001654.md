### Title
Identification of a biomarker in cerebrospinal fluid for neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease

### Description
Gaucher disease, a recessive inherited metabolic disorder caused by defects in the gene encoding glucosylceramidase (GlcCerase), can be divided into three subtypes according to the appearance of symptoms associated with central nervous system involvement. We now identify a protein, glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB), that acts as an authentic marker of brain pathology in neurological forms of Gaucher disease. Using three independent techniques, including quantitative global proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in samples from Gaucher disease patients that display neurological symptoms, we demonstrate a correlation between the severity of symptoms and GPNMB levels. Moreover, GPNMB levels in the CSF correlate with disease severity in a mouse model of Gaucher disease. GPNMB was also elevated in brain samples from patients with type 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. Our data suggest that GPNMB can be used as a marker to quantify neuropathology in Gaucher disease patients and as a marker of treatment efficacy once suitable treatments towards the neurological symptoms of Gaucher disease become available.

### Sample Protocol
CSF was collected from patients suffering from Type 3 Gaucher and healthy individuals. Proteins were reduced by incubation with 5 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 60°C followed by alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 30 min at 21°C. Proteins were subsequently digested with trypsin (Promega) overnight for 6 h followed by trypsin for 16 h at 37°C. Digestions were stopped by addition of trifluroacetic acid (1%, v/v). Samples were stored at -80˚C.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was imported into TransOmics® software (Waters) (also known as Progenesis® LC-MS). The software was used for retention time alignment and peak detection of precursor peptides. A master peak list was generated from all MS/MS events and analyzed using Mascot v2.4 (Matrix Sciences). Data was searched against forward and reversed human sequences of UniprotKB version 05_2012 including 125 common laboratory contaminants. Fixed modification was set to carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modification was set to oxidation of methionines. Search results were then imported back to TransOmics to annotate identified peaks. Identifications were filtered such that the global false discovery rate was no more than 1%. Differential analysis was conducted by direct comparison of aligned peptide intensities across all samples. Technical replicates were averaged and a Student’s t-Test, after logarithmic transformation, was used to identify significant differences in the biological replicas.
