### Title
Enhancing Top-Down Proteomics Data Analysis by Combining Deconvolution Results through a Machine Learning Strategy

### Description
Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for identification and comprehensive characterization of proteoforms arising from alternative splicing, sequence variation, and post-translational modifications. While the technique is powerful, it suffered from the complex dataset generated from top-down MS experiments, which requires sequential data processing steps for data interpretation. Deconvolution of the complex isotopic distribution that arises from naturally occurring isotopes is a critical step in the data processing process. Multiple algorithms are currently available to deconvolute top-down mass spectra; however, each algorithm generates different deconvoluted peak lists with varied accuracy comparing to true positive annotations. In this study, we have designed a machine learning strategy that can process and combine the peak lists from different deconvolution results. By optimizing clustering results, deconvolution results from THRASH, TopFD, MS-Deconv, and SNAP algorithms were combined into consensus peak lists at various thresholds using either a simple voting ensemble method or a random forest machine learning algorithm. The random forest model outperformed the single best algorithm. This machine learning strategy could enhance the accuracy and confidence in protein identification during database search by accelerating detection of true positive peaks while filtering out false positive peaks. Thus, this method showed promises in enhancing proteoform identification and characterization for high-throughput data analysis in top-down proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
The detail sample processing protocol could be found in https://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.8b06267.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was processed using MASH Explorer which can be downloaded from http://ge.crb.wisc.edu/software.html. The expert annotations provided in the submission were obtained and verified manually using the MASH software with the embedded enhanced-THRASH algorithm at 60% fit setting. The peaks were manually validated by adjusting the most abundant m/z and charge state of each monoisotopic distribution.

### Publication Abstract
Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for the identification and comprehensive characterization of proteoforms arising from alternative splicing, sequence variation, and post-translational modifications. However, the complex data set generated from top-down MS experiments requires multiple sequential data processing steps to successfully interpret the data for identifying and characterizing proteoforms. One critical step is the deconvolution of the complex isotopic distribution that arises from naturally occurring isotopes. Multiple algorithms are currently available to deconvolute top-down mass spectra, resulting in different deconvoluted peak lists with varied accuracy compared to true positive annotations. In this study, we have designed a machine learning strategy that can process and combine the peak lists from different deconvolution results. By optimizing clustering results, deconvolution results from THRASH, TopFD, MS-Deconv, and SNAP algorithms were combined into consensus peak lists at various thresholds using either a simple voting ensemble method or a random forest machine learning algorithm. For the random forest algorithm, which had better predictive performance, the consensus peak lists on average could achieve a recall value (true positive rate) of 0.60 and a precision value (positive predictive value) of 0.78. It outperforms the single best algorithm, which achieved a recall value of only 0.47 and a precision value of 0.58. This machine learning strategy enhanced the accuracy and confidence in protein identification during database searches by accelerating the detection of true positive peaks while filtering out false positive peaks. Thus, this method shows promise in enhancing proteoform identification and characterization for high-throughput data analysis in top-down proteomics.
