### Title
Flue-cured tobacco protein group

### Description
Up to now, the mechanism of the effect of topping on tobacco hormone regulation is not clear, and most studies on plant hormone signal transduction pathways rely on gene or transcriptional pathways.  In this study, the regulatory mechanism of hormones in roots and leaves of topped and untopped tobacco was studied at the protein level.

### Sample Protocol
After topping and non-topping of flue-cured tobacco, the samples of leaves and roots were collected, then the soil or obvious pollutants on the surface of the samples were washed with PBS, and the surface liquid was absorbed by absorbent paper, and the liquid nitrogen quick-frozen 5min was stored at-80 â„ƒ.Samples according to the manufacturer's instructions, samples consisting of leaves and roots are marked with six different iTRAQ tags (115,116,117,118,119,121) using the iTRAQ Reagent-8 Multiplexing Kit from AB SCIEX, USA.  The leaf and root samples are mixed with the same amount of each marker sample respectively.  The mixed samples were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Durashell C18 column (5 mm, 100 mm, 4.6250 mm) installed in Thermo DINOEX Ulally 3000 BioRS system.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS data initially underwent analysis using ProteinPilot Software v4.5 from Applied Biosystem in the United States.The software utilized ProteinPilot's Paragon database search algorithm and nonlinear fitting techniques to determine the false discoveryrate(FDR)regarding peptide identification and quantification To blueuce the occurrence ofincorrect identifications of proteinsa confidence threshold of 95%(equivalent to the unused ProtScore confidence value of 1.3 in ProteinPilot software) was used for protein identification Additionally,proteins needed to have at least one unique peptide to be consideblue as identified.Furthermoreproteins exhibiting a difference in expression greater than 2-fold (log2 fold-change>1) were classified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).In order to understand the biological and functional characteristics of all the proteins that were detectedthe protein sequences were matched with Gene Ontology Terms.Initiallya homology search was conducted for all the identified sequences using a localized NCBI blast program against the NCBInrdatabaseUse the KEGG online service tool to annotate the protein with KEGG
