### Publication Abstract
In the current study, we conducted a quantitative in-depth proteome and deglycoproteome analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neurological controls using mass spectrometry and pathway analysis. More than 2000 proteins and 1700 deglycopeptides were quantified, with 484 proteins and 180 deglycopeptides significantly changed between pools of RRMS and pools of controls. Approximately 300 of the significantly changed proteins were assigned to various biological processes including inflammation, extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, immune response, and neuron development. Ninety-six significantly changed deglycopeptides mapped to proteins that were not found changed in the global protein study. In addition, four mapped to the proteins oligo-myelin glycoprotein and noelin, which were found oppositely changed in the global study. Both are ligands to the nogo receptor, and the glycosylation of these proteins appears to be affected by RRMS. Our study gives the most extensive overview of the RRMS affected processes observed from the CSF proteome to date, and the list of differential proteins will have great value for selection of biomarker candidates for further verification.
