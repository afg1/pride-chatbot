### Title
Optimized MeOH/MTBE-based Protein Precipitation and Lipid Removal Enables High Enrichment of Low Molecular Weight Peptides and Proteins from Human Plasma

### Description
Low molecular weight (LMW) peptides and proteins (LMWPs, < 30 kDa) in human plasma, serving as potential biomarkers or drug targets, are endowed with a wealth of biological and clinical research values. However, the extraction of LMW species is retarded by high-abundance proteins (HAPs) and therein large dynamic concentration ranges of proteins in plasma. Here we present an optimized MeOH/MTBE-based organic solvent precipitation approach that combining the efficient protein precipitation and effective delipidation (referred here as MeOH/MTBE) to enrich LMWPs from human plasma. The Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis showed that MeOH/MTBE can not only maximally deplete HAPs but also effectively extract LMWPs from human plasma. By coupling with Top-Down Proteomics (TDP) strategy, MeOH/MTBE enabled the identification of 725 peptides derived from 158 proteins on average from human plasma, which should represent the largest number to our best knowledge with regard to TDP-based single LC-MS/MS acquisition. When combined with Bottom-Up Proteomics (BUP) strategy, MeOH/MTBE allowed for the identification of 376 proteins from human plasma. Notably, 155 out of 376 identified proteins (41.2%) were found to be with a molecular weight under 30 kDa, which further proved the efficient enrichment of LMWPs from human plasma by MeOH/MTBE approach. Moreover, concentrations of the identified proteins were found to span 5-6 orders of magnitude according to the PaxDb dataset. Additionally, many low abundant peptides including 25 neuropeptides and 19 smORF-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) derived from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were detected. Taken together, the MeOH/MTBE approach described here represents a simple, rapid and reproducible methodology for efficient and sensitive analysis of LMWPs and low abundant proteins from human plasma, which will greatly facilitate the selective identification and quantification of LMWPs from human plasma and accelerate the discovery rate of potential biomarkers and drug targets.

### Sample Protocol
MeOH/MTBE strategy Plasma, mixed with 50 ������L deionized water and 250 ������L MTBE, was vortexed thoroughly and precipitated with 250 ������L methanol for half an hour (MTBE : deionized water : methanol(v/v/v)=5:1:1) followed with centrifugation at 21,000������g for 30 min. The supernatant was retained and dealt with delipidation, which was realized by adding 500 ������L MTBE and 100 ������L deionized water to layer the whole system (MTBE : deionized water : methanol(v/v/v)=5:3:1), prior to centrifuging at 1,000������g for 10 min. LMW spices were collected in the lower layer. TCA 50 ������L aliquot was diluted with 50 ������L urea buffer and precipitated with 200 ������L 20% TCA. Supernatants were gained and used for further analysis.     All the extractive yields were desalted with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid-phase extraction (HLB-SPE) columns (Waters, Milford, MA). On the washing phase, 20%, 40% and 60% ACN/0.1% FA were specific used. One aliquot was utilized for TDP and the other one was resuspended with 8 M urea/100 mM NH4HCO3 and reducted with 20 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37 ������C for 1h, followed with alkylated in 40 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Lys C and Trypsin were added with 50:1 for digestion and the enzymatic peptides were subjected to BUP analysis. Dissolving in 0.1% FA (phase A), samples were loaded onto Acclaim��������� PepMap��������� 100 C18 trap column (3 ������m, 0.075 mm ������ 20 mm) and separated on Acclaim��������� PepMap��������� 100 C18 analytical column (2 ������m, 0.075 mm ������ 250 mm). Liquid Chromatography gradient was set as follows: 1���������8% phase B (0.1% FA in ACN), 4 min; 8���������30% B, 116 min in TDP and 72 min in BUP, separately at a constant flow rate of 400 nL/min. Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Scientific) was connected to Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). All spectra were captured with a resolution of 60,000 (m/z 200), and the dynamic exclusion time was 30s. The AGC value was 5 ������ 105 and maximum fill time was 100ms in Full scan mode. Meanwhile, MS/MS spectra were acquired at AGC 2 ������ 105, maximum injection time 120ms. EThcD and HCD are all adopted as different activation type, the collision energy of which is 40%. All methods were sampled by LC-MS/MS in technique triplicates.

### Data Protocol
All raw data files were searched against the human Uniport database (released July 13, 2018) combined with commonly observed contaminants (245 sequences) and Neuropeptide sequence databases (http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/NeuroPedia/) in Proteome Discoverer 2.2. The FDR was set to 0.01. In BUP, the precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 0.02 Da. Trypsin was selected as the digestion enzyme and two maximum miss cleavage was allowed. Carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed modification, while methionine oxidation was set as the only dynamic modification. In TDP, precursor and fragment mass tolerance were 20 and 0.02 ppm. No enzyme (non-specific enzyme) and methionine oxidation were chosen.

### Publication Abstract
Low-molecular weight proteins and peptides (LMWPs, &lt;30 kDa) in human plasma serve as potential biomarkers or drug targets and are endowed with desirable traits for biological and clinical studies. However, the identification of LMWPs from plasma is retarded by high-abundance proteins, high-molecular weight proteins, and lipids. Here, we present a sequential precipitation and delipidation (SPD) method for the efficient enrichment of LMWPs based on methyl-<i>tert</i>-butyl ether/methanol/water systems. The enriched LMWP sample was analyzed by single-shot liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry employing both HCD and EThcD without tryptic digestion, and 725 peptides were identified on average. The LMWP sample was also digested and analyzed using a bottom-up proteomics pipeline, and 289 proteins were identified, of which 129 (44.6%) proteins were less than 30 kDa and lipoprotein-associated proteins were significantly enriched. Additionally, 25 neuropeptides and 19 long noncoding RNA-encoded polypeptides were identified. Taken together, the SPD method shows good sensitivity and reproducibility when compared with other enrichment methods and has great potential for clinical biomarker discovery and application.
