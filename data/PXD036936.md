### Title
Independent bivalve evolutionary adaptation towards chemosymbiosis, insights from the genome of vent thyasirid

### Description
To understand the symbiotic relationship between the Conchocele bisecta and its bacterial symbiont, the metaproteomic sequencing and anlysis of the symbiotic gill tissue of Conchocele bisecta were conducted.

### Sample Protocol
The gill tissue was grinded and sonicated using a high intensity ultrasonic processor, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Then the protein solution was digested with trypsin, and peptides were separated on a nanoElute UHPLC system. The peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry with the timsTOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics) in a PASEF mode.

### Data Protocol
The raw MS data was processed with MasQuant search engine v1.6.15.0.
