### Title
Spatially-Resolved Proteomic Analysis of the Lens Extracellular Diffusion Barrier

### Description
This study is to characterize the molecular components that could contribute to the formation of lens extracellular diffusion barrier. Three regions were isolated from lens cortex using laser capture microdissection and the proteome changes in these three regions were studied.

### Sample Protocol
Three regions of the lens cortex were isolated using LCM guided by a dye penetration experiment. Soluble fraction and insoluble fraction were prepared from the samples. The samples were reduced and alkylated and digested by Lys C and trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The data were searched by MaxQuant and LFQ intensities were used for quantification in Perseus.
