### Title
The ribosome quality control factor Asc1 determines the fate of HSP70 mRNA on and off the ribosome

### Description
Immunoprecipitation of Asc1 protein in Sacchromyces cerevisiae under Heat shock and basal growth conditions.

### Sample Protocol
FLAG-tagged Asc1 (Asc1p-3×FLAG) yeast cultures were grown in 400 mL YPD at 25°C to early log phase and heat shocked for 1 h at 42°C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,750 rpm for 3 min at 4°C. The pellets were washed with 10 mL water, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and resuspended in 2 mL of lysis buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, 10 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing Complete X protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitors (1M NaF, 0.2M NaAPi, and Na2vO4). Glass beads (0.5 mm) were added, and tubes were vortexed 20 times with 30 s on-off cycles in a cold room. Lysates were separated from the beads by a quick centrifugation at 4°C and transferred to new tubes. About 100 µL of M2-anti-FLAG beads (Millipore sigma, Cat# M8823) were washed three times with 500 µL of lysis buffer, then incubated with the lysates for 2 h on a nutator in a cold room. The beads were magnetized, and the flowthrough was collected. The beads were then washed thrice with 1 mL of lysis buffer and each wash was collected. Samples of the beads, lysate, flow-through, and washes were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and western blotted for FLAG. Immunoprecipitation samples were sent to Proteomics Services at the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute for mass spectrometry. For each sample, proteins on bead were loaded onto a single stacking gel band to remove lipids, detergents, and salts. The single gel band containing all proteins was reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetic acid, and digested with trypsin. Extracted peptides were re-solubilized in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and loaded onto a Thermo Acclaim Pepmap (Thermo, 75uM ID X 2cm C18 3uM beads) precolumn and then onto an Acclaim Pepmap Easyspray (Thermo, 75uM X 15cm with 2uM C18 beads) analytical column separation using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 uHPLC at 250 nl/min with a gradient of 2-35% organic (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 3

### Data Protocol
Peptides were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer operating at 120,000 resolution (FWHM in MS1) with HCD sequencing (15,000 resolution) at top speed for all peptides with a charge of 2+ or greater. The raw data were converted into *.mgf format (Mascot generic format) for searching using the Mascot 2.6.2 search engine (Matrix Science) against yeast protein sequences (Uniprot 2022). The database search results were loaded onto Scaffold Q+ Scaffold_5.0 (Proteome Sciences) for statistical treatment and data visualization. Samples were compared using spectral counting
