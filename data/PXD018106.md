### Title
Crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis of ùõæTuRC complex

### Description
The ùõæ-tubulin ring complex (ùõæTuRC) is the major microtubule nucleator in cells. The mechanism of its regulation is not understood. To understand the molecular basis of microtubule nucleation, we investigate the structure of ùõæTuRC using crosslinking mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
The purified ùõæTuRC complex at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in gel filtration buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM GTP and 0.02 % Brij-35) was crosslinked with 2.4 mM disulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) in a thermomixer for 1 h at 24¬∞C and 850 rpm. The reaction was quenched with 92 mM NH4HCO3 in a thermomixer for 30 min at 24¬∞C and 850 rpm. The crosslinked sample was cold-acetone precipitated. The dried protein pellet was resolubilized in 40 ¬µL digestion buffer (8M urea in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) with 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT)) to an estimated protein concentration of 1 mg/mL. Dissolved protein sample was reduced by addition of 0.2 uL 1M DTT, the reduction reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The free -SH groups in the sample were then alkylated by adding 1.2 uL 500 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubating at room temperature for 20 minutes. After alkylation, 0.2 uL 1M DTT was added to quench excess of IAA. Subsequently, protein sample was digested with LysC (with 1:50 (m/m) protein to protease ratio) at room temperature for four hours. The sample was then diluted with 100 mM ABC to reach urea concentration of 1.5 M. Trypsin was added with 1:50 (m/m) protein to protease ratio to further digest proteins for over night (~15 hours) at room temperature. Resulting peptides were de-salted using C18 StageTips (PMID:17703201).  20% of total peptides were directly analysed by liquid chromatography‚Äìtandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in duplicate. The remaining 80% peptides were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography in order to enrich for crosslinked peptides (PMID:24356771). Peptides were separated using a Superdex Peptide 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 10 Œºl/min. The mobile phase consisted of 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The earliest five peptide-containing fractions (50 Œºl each) were collected. Solvent was removed using a vacuum concentrator. The fractions were then analysed by LC-MS/MS.  LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), connected to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each SEC fraction was resuspended in 1.6% v/v acetonitrile 0.1% v/v formic acid and analysed with two LC-MS/MS acquisitions. Peptides were injected onto a 50-centimetre EASY-Spray C18 LC column (Thermo Scientific) that is operated at 50¬∞C column temperature. Mobile phase A consists of water, 0.1% v/v formic acid and mobile phase B consists of 80% v/v acetonitrile and 0.1% v/v formic acid. Peptides were loaded and separated at a flowrate of 0.3 ŒºL/min. Eluted peptides were ionized by an EASY-Spray source (Thermo Scientific) and introduced directly into the mass spectrometer. For non-fractionated samples, peptides were separated using a linear gradient going from 2% mobile phase B to 40% mobile phase B over 110 minutes, followed by a linear increase from 40% to 95% mobile phase B in eleven minutes. The MS data is acquired in the data-dependent mode with three-second acquisition cycle. The full scan mass spectrum was recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000. The ions with a charge state from 3+ to 7+ were isolated and fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with 30% collision energy. The fragmentation spectra were then recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 50000. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with single repeat count and 60-second exclusion duration. The collected SEC fractions were each analysed with duplicated acquisitions (except one fraction with single acquisition).  Peptides were separated by applying a gradient ranging from 2% to 45% B over 90 min. Gradient was optimized for each corresponding SEC fraction. Following the separating gradient, the content of B was ramped to 55% and 95% within 2.5 minutes each. The MS data is acquired in the data-dependent mode with the top-speed option. For each three-second acquisition cycle, the full scan mass spectrum was recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000. The ions with a charge state from 3+ to 7+ were isolated and fragmented using Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). For each isolated precursor, one of three collision energy settings (26%, 28% or 30%) was selected for fragmentation using data dependent decision tree based on the m/z and charge of the precursor. The fragmentation spectra were then recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 50000. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with single repeat count and 60-second exclusion duration.

### Data Protocol
The MS2 peak lists were generated from the raw mass spectrometric data files using the MSConvert module in ProteoWizard (version 3.0.11729). The default parameters were applied, except that Top MS/MS Peaks per 100 Da was set to 20 and the de-noising function was enabled. Precursor and fragment m/z values were recalibrated. Identification of crosslinked peptides was carried out using xiSEARCH software (https://www.rappsilberlab.org/software/xisearch) (PMID:31556486). Peak lists from all LC-MS/MS acquisitions were searched against the sequence and the reversed sequence of gamma TuRC subunits. The following parameters were applied for the search: MS accuracy = 5 ppm; MS2 accuracy = 10 ppm; enzyme = trypsin (with full tryptic specificity); allowed number of missed cleavages = two; missing monoisotopic peak=2 5; cross-linker = BS3 the reaction specificity for BS3 was assumed to be for lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and protein N termini); fixed modifications = carbamidomethylation on cysteine; variable modifications = oxidation on methionine, modifications by BS3 that are hydrolyzed or amidated on the end. Identified crosslinked peptide candidates were filtered using xiFDR (PMID: 28267312). A false discovery rate (FDR) of 2% on residue-pair-level was applied with ‚Äúboost between‚Äù option selected.  A list of identified crosslinked residue pairs is reported in Supplemental table S2. Structural interpretation of inter-protein crosslinks was focused on protein pairs that were crosslinked with three or more residue pairs. The pseudo-atomic model of gammaTuRC complex was compared against the crosslinking data. The distances between the CŒ± atoms of crosslinked residue pairs in the model were measured and compared against a theoretical crosslinking limit of  30 √Ö for corsslinker BS3 (calculated based the spacer of the crosslinker and the length of the side chains of crosslinked residues).

### Publication Abstract
The &#x3b3;-tubulin ring complex (&#x3b3;TuRC) is the major microtubule nucleator in cells. The mechanism of its regulation is not understood. We purified human &#x3b3;TuRC and measured its nucleation properties in a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy-based real-time nucleation assay. We find that &#x3b3;TuRC stably caps the minus ends of microtubules that it nucleates stochastically. Nucleation is inefficient compared with microtubule elongation. The 4&#xa0;&#xc5; resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of &#x3b3;TuRC, combined with crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis, reveals an asymmetric conformation with only part of the complex in a "closed" conformation matching the microtubule geometry. Actin in the core of the complex, and MZT2 at the outer perimeter of the closed part of &#x3b3;TuRC appear to stabilize the closed conformation. The opposite side of &#x3b3;TuRC is in an "open," nucleation-incompetent conformation, leading to a structural asymmetry explaining the low nucleation efficiency of purified human &#x3b3;TuRC. Our data suggest possible regulatory mechanisms for microtubule nucleation by &#x3b3;TuRC closure.
