### Title
The effect of oleanolic acid glucuronides from marigold (Calendula officinalis) on the possible modification of immunogenic proteins from infective Heigmosomoides polygyrus bakeri larvae (L3)

### Description
The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of glucuronides of oleanolic acid (GlcUAOA) extracted from Calendula officinalis flower on the profile of immunogenic proteins of somatic extract of infective H. polygyrus bakeri L3 stage.

### Sample Protocol
H. polygyrus larvae were cultured in vitro for 10 days. Nematodes were sonicated on ice and soluble proteins from somatic extract were separated using SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were cut from gel and acquired samples were prepared for LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The acquired MS/MS data were preprocessed with Mascot Distiller software and a search was performed with the Mascot Search Engine. Obtained results were filtered using Mascot Percolator.

### Publication Abstract
The influence of triterpenoid saponins on subcellular morphological changes in the cells of parasitic nematodes remains poorly understood. Our study examines the effect of oleanolic acid glucuronides from marigold (<i>Calendula officinalis</i>) on the possible modification of immunogenic proteins from infective <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</i> larvae (L3). Our findings indicate that the triterpenoid saponins alter the subcellular morphology of the larvae and prevent recognition of nematode-specific proteins by rabbit immune-IgG. TEM ultrastructure and HPLC analysis showed that microtubule and cytoskeleton fibres were fragmented by saponin treatment. MASCOT bioinformatic analysis revealed that in larvae exposed to saponins, the immune epitopes of their proteins altered. Several mitochondrial and cytoskeleton proteins involved in signalling and cellular processes were downregulated or degraded. As possible candidates, the following set of recognised proteins may play a key role in the immunogenicity of larvae: beta-tubulin isotype, alpha-tubulin, myosin, paramyosin isoform-1, actin, disorganized muscle protein-1, ATP-synthase, beta subunit, carboxyl transferase domain protein, glutamate dehydrogenase, enolase (phosphopyruvate hydratase), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 2, tropomyosin, arginine kinase or putative chaperone protein DnaK, and galactoside-binding lectin. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024205.
