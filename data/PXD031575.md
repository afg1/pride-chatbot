### Title
iTRAq and TMTPro datasets Rescored with Prosit

### Description
Rescoring with Prosit predictions and percolator 6 different PRIDE submited datasets: 1- PXD017472 2- PXD017621 3- PXD002214 4- PXD021401 5- PXD027089 6- PXD024275

### Sample Protocol
Each dataset was processed in a different way refer to the Pride submission for more info.

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw files were searched using MaxQuant search engine 2.0.1.0 against the UniProt human and mouse databases (for mouse-related datasets) for protein identification and iTRAQ quantification. MS2 labeling was selected for iTRAQ datasets and TMTpro fixed modification for TMTPro datasets. In addition, Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021 Da) was set as fixed modifications, and oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da) variable modifications was selected. We predicted all spectra via prosit to rescore the datasets. Used Percolator for 1%FDR estimation of PSMs and Peptides, and picked FDR approach for proteins.
