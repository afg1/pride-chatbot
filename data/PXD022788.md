### Title
An environmental ecocorona influences the formation and evolution of the biological corona on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes - proteome

### Description
In this study, the formation of a protein corona on two different SWCNTs under presence or absence of an ecocorona was investigated at four different time points.

### Sample Protocol
The SWCNTs were incubated in carp plasma and unbound proteins were removed. For untargeted proteomics, proteins forming the protein corona were eluted using 2 % SDS with subsequent heating to 95 °C. For each sample, 25 µg protein were further processed using TMT labeling on paramagnetic beads that allow for single-pot sample processing. Thus, two fractions were obtained, which were analyzed on a nano-UPLC system (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, USA) coupled online to the mass spectrometer (QExactive HF, Thermo Scientific, USA) via a chip-based electrospray ionization source (Nanomate, Advion, USA).

### Data Protocol
Obtained raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 and UniprotKB entries (reviewed and unreviewed) of Cyprinus Carpio (4th September 2019). For this purpose, an iterative workflow was applied. Obtained fold changes were Log2-transformed and median-normalized before calculation of p-values, which were adjusted according to Benjamini-Hochberg. These steps were conducted with R.
