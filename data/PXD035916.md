### Title
TESMIN interactome characterization

### Description
We performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to capture TESMIN interactome.

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitation: Proteins were extracted using NP40 lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10% Glycerol]. Protein lysates were mixed with 20 μL Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (DB10009, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2.0 μg antibody. The immune complexes were incubated for 1 h at 4°C and washed 3 times with NP40 lysis buffer. Co-immunoprecipitated products were then eluted by resuspension in 2x SDS sample buffer [125 mM Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% sucrose, 0.01% bromophenol blue] and 10 min incubation at 70°C.
Biotinylated protein pulldown: protein lysates were mixed with 50 µL SA-conjugated magnetic beads (DB65001, Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by 1 h incubation at 4°C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed once with 1 mL wash solution 1 [2% SDS], once with 1 mL wash solution 2 [50mM HEPES-NaOH (pH7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100], once with 1 mL wash solution 3 [10mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40]. Biotinylated proteins were then eluted by resuspension in 2x SDS sample buffer [125 mM Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% sucrose, 0.01% bromophenol blue] and 5 min incubation at 95°C.
Mass: Protein samples were first subjected to chloroform/methanol precipitation to remove SDS. Then, the dried pellets were dissolved in 20μL of 0.1% RapiGest (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide, and digested by treatment with trypsin and purified with a C18 tip (GL-Science, Tokyo, Japan). The resultant peptides were subjected to nanocapillary reversed-phase LC-MS/MS analysis using a C18 column (25 cm × 75 um, 1.6 µm; IonOpticks, Victoria, Australia) on a nanoLC system (Bruker Daltoniks, Bremen, Germany) connected to a tims TOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltoniks) and a modified nano-electrospray ion source (CaptiveSpray; Bruker Daltoniks). The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). Linear gradient elution was carried out from 2% to 35% solvent B for 18 min at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. The ion spray voltage was set at 1.6 kV in the positive ion mode. Ions were collected in the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) device over 100 ms and MS and MS/MS data were acquired over an m/z range of 100-1,700. During the collection of MS/MS data, the TIMS cycle was adjusted to 1.1 s and included 1 MS plus 10 parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF)-MS/MS scans, each containing on average 12 MS/MS spectra (>100 Hz), and nitrogen gas was used as the collision gas. 

### Data Protocol
The resulting data were processed using DataAnalysis version 5.1 (Bruker Daltoniks), and proteins were searched using MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the SwissProt database.

### Publication Abstract
Characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is a key to understanding the functions of proteins of interest. Recently developed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) has been actively investigated as an alternative PPI mapping method because of its usefulness in uncovering transient PPI. Here, as an example of proximity labeling proteomics application in the testis, we generated two transgenic mouse lines expressing two biotin ligases (BioID2 or TurboID) fused with TESMIN, which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus during meiotic progression and is required for reproduction. The BioID2 transgene, albeit not the TurboID transgene, rescued fertility defects of the Tesmin KO male mice, indicating that the TESMIN-BioID2 fusion can physiologically replace TESMIN. Furthermore, biotinylated protein pull-down and affinity-purification followed by mass spectrometry using the TESMIN-BioID2 transgenic mice captured components of the MYBL1-MuvB complex that regulate cell-cycle gene expression. Thus, our study shows that proximity labeling proteomics can be applied in male germ cells, although the choice of biotin ligase needs to be carefully tested.
