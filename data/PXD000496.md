### Title
Proteomics of TGF beta signaling

### Description
HaCaT cells were treated with TGF beta1 for different time points to follw protein and phosphoproteome changes on a temporal scale. Samples were analyzed using a shotgun proteomic approach on a Q exactive coupled to  reverse phase HPLC. The  measurements resulted in the identification of over 20,000 phopshorylation sites and over 6,000 protein expression profiles.
