### Title
Human cerebrospinal fluid analysis by data-independent analysis The Cerebrospinal fluid samples were denaturated and reduced.

### Description
Cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls were used in this study. After tryptic digestion, all samples were spiked with indexed retention time (iRT) peptides and were measured using a DIA mass spectrometry approach.

### Sample Protocol
The CSF samples were prepared for digestion using consecutively RapiGestTM SF Surfactant, DTT and iodoacetamide. Then, proteolytic digestion was performedby trypsin solution and stopped by TFA. Dried peptides were resuspended in TFA. The samples were spiked with iRT peptides (Biognosys AG) before they were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. The peptides were injected into a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH) operated in DDA mode.

### Data Protocol
The DIA-files were analyzed using SpectronautTM Pulsar software (Biognosys AG). The false discovery rate (FDR), as well as the Q-value, had a cutoff-value of 1 %. No normalization was performed inside SpectronautTM Pulsar. Instead, a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing normalization was applied. Additionally, a regression analysis was performed to counteract any batch effect.
