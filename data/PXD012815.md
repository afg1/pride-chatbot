### Title
An essential role for cullin 3 ubiquitin ligases and phototropin 2 turnover in seedling chloroplast development (de-etiolation)

### Description
Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings RV86-5 (contains a dexamethasone-inducible ubiquitin variant that contains Arg instead of Lys at position 48; ̈Schlögelhofer et al., 2005) were surface-sterilized and sown on Uhelon 120T (Silk & Progress, Czech Republic) mesh placed on 1% (w/v) agar containing a half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.7), stratified at 4 °C for 3 d, and cultivated at 21 °C/19 °C day/night temperatures, with a 16 h photoperiod (90 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity) for 14 d. On the fourteenth day (after the first 2 h of the day period), the Uhelon mesh with the seedlings was transferred onto a new solid medium supplemented with (i) 5×10−4% (v/v) DMSO (mock); (ii) 0.7 or 7.0 μM dexamethasone (DEX) and rinsed with DMSO or DEX-supplemented water for mock and DEX-treated seedlings, respectively, and incubated for 24 hours.

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, two independently grown replicates, each consisting of at least 20 Arabidopsis seedlings cultivated as described above, were extracted by acetone/TCA and phenol extraction then digested in solution with immobilized trypsin beads (Promega, http://www.promega.com/). The resulting peptides were desalted, dried and dissolved in 0.5% (v/v) formic acid in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, then analyzed by nanoflow C18 reverse-phase liquid chromatography using a 15 cm Ascentis Express Column (0.1 mm inner diameter; Sigma-Aldrich) and a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano UPLC system (Thermo, www.thermoscientific.com) directly coupled to a CaptiveSpray nanoESI source (Bruker) and an UHR maXis impact q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, www.bruker.com). Peptides were eluted with a 180-min, 4% to 40% acetonitrile gradient. MS/MS spectra were acquired in an intensity-dependent mode at a rate of 2–20 Hz with a maximum of 20 precursor ions and an MS spectra rate of 2 Hz.

### Data Protocol
Raw files obtained from the MS analysis were analyzed by Profile Analysis 2.1 (Bruker) and MS precursors with significant differences in two biological replicates (absolute ratio ≥1.4, with t-test p-values <0.05), and peptide spectra were searched against the TAIR10 Arabidopsis database using the Mascot 2.4 (database search criteria: trypsin; variable modifications — methionine oxidation, NQ deamidation, ST phosphorylation; peptide tolerance — 10 ppm; allowed one missed cleavage; MS/MS tolerance — 0.06 Da) and Bruker's ProteinScape percolator algorithms (target FDR < 1%) to identify source proteins (using high-confidence peptides, p < 0.05 with at least one distinct proteotypic peptide per protein). Quantitative differences were further manually validated by comparing corresponding peptide ion signal peak areas in Skyline 1.4 (MacCossLab Software; https://skyline.gs.washington.edu).  **For the PRIDE database deposit, three representative raw files per biological replicate were converted by Bruker's Data Analysis 4.1 and the resulting files were searched against Araport11 database using ProteomeDiscoverer 2.2 and Sequest algorithm. Spectra were recalibrated and searched against the Araport11 database, 35 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.1 Da fragment mass tolerance, allowed one missed cleavage and dynamic modifications - oxidation (M), deamidation (N, Q) and dynamic N-terminal modifications - acetylation.
