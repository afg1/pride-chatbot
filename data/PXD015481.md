### Title
Human IP pull down analysis of KeapI interactomes

### Description
This is a comparative interactomes of human KeapI protein by SIALC-based quantitative proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were enriched by colbat resins for His-tagged KeapI protein and separated by an SDS gel followed by in-gel digested and nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS/MS raw dtaa files were processed by Proteomer Discoverer 2.2 under SILAC quantitation module.
