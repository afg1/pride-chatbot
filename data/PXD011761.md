### Title
Disruption of podocyte cytoskeletal biomechanics by dasatinib leads to nephrotoxicity

### Description
Kinase inhibitors (KIs) used in cancer therapeutics are associated with various side effects. One of the most significant adverse events that lead to discontinuation or modification of treatment is nephrotoxicity. We have identified BCR-ABL1 inhibitor dasatinib as a potential glomerular nephrotoxin due to its direct effect on podocyte biophysics. In order to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms used phospho-tyrosine enriched shotgun proteomics in immortalized mouse kidney podocytes treated with dasatinib.

### Sample Protocol
Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were plated on 15 cm culture dishes at a concentration of 2,000 cells per cm2. After 10 days of differentiation at 37ºC, cells treated for one hour with 2 μM dasatinib or DMSO vehicle control (n = 3, each) were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4. To enrich for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, 0.5 mg total protein from each concentration-normalized lysate were incubated with 8 μg anti-mouse ferromagnetic beads pre-coated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibodies at 4ºC overnight on a rotating carousel. The beads were washed five times with 1 M NaCl with 0.1% Tween 20 at 4ºC and then eluted using 40 μL of 2X loading buffer (Boston Bioproducts) and boiled at 95ºC for five minutes. In order to remove contamination that could affect the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the eluted IP proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE for in-gel trypsin digestion.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS spectra were searched against the Swissprot mouse database (16,571 sequences) using Mascot (V2.3) search engine on Proteome Discoverer (V1.4) platform. The mass error tolerance was 10 ppm for MS and 0.1 Da for MS/MS. Methionine oxidation, phosphorylation of tyrosine and cysteine carbamidomethyl (IAM) modification were set as variable modifications. The protein homologs were further grouped in Scaffold software (Proteome Software, Inc) to remove redundancies. Acceptable protein false discovery rate cut off was less than 1%.

### Publication Abstract
Nephrotoxicity is a critical adverse event that leads to discontinuation of kinase inhibitor (KI) treatment. Here we show, through meta-analyses of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, that dasatinib is associated with high risk for glomerular toxicity that is uncoupled from hypertension, suggesting a direct link between dasatinib and podocytes. We further investigate the cellular effects of dasatinib and other comparable KIs with varying risks of nephrotoxicity. Dasatinib treated podocytes show significant changes in focal adhesions, actin cytoskeleton, and morphology that are not observed with other KIs. We use phosphoproteomics and kinome profiling to identify the molecular mechanisms of dasatinib-induced injury to the actin cytoskeleton, and atomic force microscopy to quantify impairment to cellular biomechanics. Furthermore, chronic administration of dasatinib in mice causes reversible glomerular dysfunction, loss of stress fibers, and foot process effacement. We conclude that dasatinib induces nephrotoxicity through altered podocyte actin cytoskeleton, leading to injurious cellular biomechanics.
