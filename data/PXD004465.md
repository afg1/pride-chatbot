### Title
Glycoproteomics reveals the presence of decorin peptides with anti-myostatin activity in human atrial fibrillation

### Description
We analysed by proteomics the cardiac extraceelular matrix in human atrial fibrillation and disvovered the presence of extracellular matrix protein fragments that can regulate cardiac cell physiology

### Sample Protocol
Samples were extracted using a 3-step protocol for extracellular matrix protein enrichment. Proteins were deglycosylated and run in Bis-tris gels. After trypsin digestion, proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS in an Orbitrap XL instrument.

### Data Protocol
MS data were searched using Mascot agains a human database 12013_08
