### Title
Posttranslational splicing modifications as a key mechanism in cytarabine resistance in AML

### Description
Despite the approval of several drugs for AML, cytarabine is still widely used as a therapeutic approach. However, most patients show resistance and only 10% of them overcome the disease. Using high-throughput screening analysis, we show that phosphorylation levels of SR proteins were elevated during cytarabine resistance. Moreover, phosphorylation of SR proteins at diagnosis was different between responder and non-responder patients, pointing to their utility to predict response. These changes correlated with altered transcriptomic profiles of SR protein target genes.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed and digested with trypsin using either the standard FASP protocol or the Protifi™ S-Trap™ Mini Spin Column Digestion Protocol. Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 micro-colums.Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS analysis using a Impact mass spectrometer (Bruker).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant against a human protein database. The “phospho(STY)sites.txt” file was loaded in Perseus for further statistical analysis.
