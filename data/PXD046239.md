### Title
Ribosomal Assembly Factor Ltv1_L216S Mass Spec

### Description
Mass spectrometry data of purified ribosomes in S. cerevisiae containing WT Ltv1 or mutation Ltv1_L216S.

### Sample Protocol
Ribosomes were prepared, purified, and acetone percipitated from S. cerevisiae containing WT Ltv1 or mutation Ltv1_L216S. The three biological replicates of WT Ltv1 and Ltv1_L216S were trypsin digested prior to MS measurment.

### Data Protocol
The data was processed using the Sequest search engine. Fragment tolerance and parent tolerance were set at 0.020 Da and 10.0 PPM, respectively. No fixed modifications were selected. Variable modifications were Deaminated (N), Oxidation (M), and Carbamidomethyl (C).
