### Title
Protein-protein interaction network dynamics induced by nitrogen starvation in Arabidopsis root membranes

### Description
With the information gathered through mass-shift- and correlation-analysis, we predict PPi on a proteomic scale and describe the results in form of a network. This experiment was done with 3 week old Arabidopsis thaliana wt seedlings grown in hydroponic culture (1/2 MS-Medium) under different nutritional conditions (N-Starvation, Full supply and Resupply after 15 min)

### Sample Protocol
Isolating membrane proteins in native form: slow grinding with Glass/PTFE Potter Elvehjem Tissue Grinder, differential centrifugation for purification of microsomal fraction. Sample preparation for mass spec. analysis: Predigestion of ca. 6µg protein with 1µl Lys-C (0.5µg/µl Wako Chemicals, Neuss), 4-fold dilution with 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8); Digestion with 1µl Sequencing Grade modified Trypsin (0.5µg/µl, Promega) overnight at 25°C Inactivation of Trypsin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, ca. 0.2% TFA (v/v)) Digested peptides were desalted over C18 Stage-Tips (Rappsilber, 2003)

### Data Protocol
Analysis by LC/MS/MS nanoflow Easy-nLC1000 (Thermo Scientific) and a Quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific). Usage of a 75µmx25cm C18 analytical column (PepMan, Thermo Scientific) with a linear gradient 4%-64% acetonitrile in 180min. Data Analysis with MaxQuant Version 1.5.3.8
