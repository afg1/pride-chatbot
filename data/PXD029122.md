### Title
Modular bottom-up proteomic sample preparation for high-throughput applications

### Description
A collection of digital automated proteomic sample preparation protocols detail three optimized step-by-step methods to: (A) lyse Gram-negative bacteria and fungal cells; (B) quantify the amount of protein extracted; and (C) normalize the amount of protein and set up tryptic digestion. These protocols have been developed to facilitate rapid, low variance sample preparation of hundreds of samples, be easily implemented on widely-available Beckman-Coulter Biomek automated liquid handlers, and allow flexibility for future protocol development

### Sample Protocol
Cells were harvested from overnight culture and distributed to 96-well deep plates at a testing OD*mLs biomass quantity. Protein were extracted following the automated protein extraction protocol, and were quantified following the automated protein DC assay protocol. 50 ug of protein were taken from each sample and normalized to digest at 1 ug/ul concentration using trypsin. The resulted tryptic digestion were analyzed by a 15 minutes per sample high-throughput DDA acquisition

### Data Protocol
Protein were identified using mascot search engine against the latest P. putida and R. toruloides proteome database.Identified proteins and their relative quantitative value (Normalized total spectra count) were analyzed by Scaffold software.
