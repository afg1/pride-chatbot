### Title
Structural basis for the toxicity of Legionella pneumophila effector SidH

### Description
Legionella pneumophila (LP) secretes more than 300 effectors into the host cytosol to facilitate intracellular replication. One of these effectors, SidH does not have sequence similarityto proteins of known function and is toxic when overexpressed in host cells. In order to understand the mechanism and function, it is important to know what host factors, SidH interacts with in human cells. Using quantitative proteomics, we uncovered multiple host proteins as potential targets of SidH.

### Sample Protocol
For mass-spectrometric analysis, GFP-SidH, and GFP-apo (control) plasmids were used for transient transfection in HEK293T cells in triplicates. Cells were harvested at 20 h post-transfection, resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, RNase inhibitor and protease inhibitor cocktail). The GFP-SidH was immunopurified using anti-GFP Agarose beads (ChromTek) and incubated for 2 h at 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then three times with wash buffer (lysis buffer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ triton X-100). GFP-SidH and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with 2x Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C. To obtain quantitative information, the samples were digested using trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) and labelled with TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent (ThermoFisher). The fractionation was carried out on an Agilent 1200 Infinity high-performance liquid chromatography system, equipped with a Gemini C18 column (3 ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼m, 110 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦, 100 x 1.0 mm, Phenomenex). The peptides were introduced into the Fusion Lumos and data dependent acquisition was performed.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis was done with MSFragger v3.741 In brief, samples were searched against the Swissprot Homo sapiens database supplemented with GFP-apo and GFP-SidH sequence (IP samples) and eventually quantified by the TMT10plex option. Log2 transformed raw TMT reporter ion intensities were normalized. Proteins were tested for differential expression using the limma package42. A protein was annotated as a hit with a false discovery rate (fdr) smaller 5 % and a fold-change of at least 100 % and as a candidate with a fdr below 20 % and a fold-change of at least 50 %.
