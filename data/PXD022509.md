### Title
A microenvironment-inspired synthetic 3D model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma organoids - CDM Sets

### Description
Cell-derived matrix (CDM) datasets from KPC-1 or HPDE cells after seven days of growth.

### Sample Protocol
CDM-generation was conducted as previously described (Beacham Curr Protoc cell Biol 2006). For LC-MS/MS, samples were resuspended in 50 µL 8M urea (Sigma Aldrich) in 100 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate (ABC, Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10 mM DTT (Sigma Aldrich) and subjected to in-solution digestion.CDM samples in 8M urea, 100 mM ABC were reduced for 2 h at 37ºC by adding 10 mM DTT (Sigma Aldrich) under continuous agitation at 1400 rpm using a Thermomix Comfort (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following alkylation by adding iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma Aldrich) at 25 mM final concentration and incubation for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently, samples were de-glycosylated by first diluting the urea to 2 M using a 100 mM ABC solution (pH 8) and adding 1kU of PNGaseF (New England BiolabsL). Deglycosylation was conducted for 2 h at 37ºC under continuous agitation (1400 rpm) and proteins were subsequently digested using LysC (Wako) and Trypsin (Promega; Cat.-No.: V5111). For digestion, 1 µg of endopeptidase LysC in 100 mM ABC were added and proteins were incubated for 2 h at 37ºC under continuous agitation (1400 rpm). Thereafter, 3 µg of Trypsin (0.5 µg/µL) were added, and samples were incubated overnight at 37ºC followed by the addition of another 1.5 µg of Trypsin (0.5 µg/µL) the next day with an additional incubation for 2h further at 37ºC in 200 µL total volume. Peptides were then acidified using 50% TFA in HPLC-grade water (Rathburns Chemicals), spun at 16,000 g for 5 min, RT and dried down using a vacuum concentrator (Thermo; Savant SC250EXP Speedvac Concentrator)) at 60ºC for about 2 hours. Peptides were then desalted and cleaned-up using HLB Cartridges (Oasis HLB Cartridge; Waters; Cat.-No.: WAT094225) on SPE vacuum manifold according to the manufactures’ instructions. In brief, samples were bound to the cartridge in 0.1% FA in HPLC-grade water (Thermo), washed and eluted in 35% Acetonitrile (Thermo) in HPLC-grade water. Cleaned peptides were then dried down using a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 50 µL 1% FA, 2% Acetonitrile and 6 µL of a 1:10 dilution were injected. Samples were analyzed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an LTQ OrbiTrap Velos Pro (Thermo Scientific) operating in positive ion mode and used in data-dependent acquisition mode. Peptides were trapped on an Acclaim PepMap 100 (C18, 100 µM x 2 cm) and then separated on an Easy-Spray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 µM x 50 cm) (Thermo Scientific) at 300 nL/min using following gradient profile (minutes:%B); 0:2, 6:5, 130:35, 132:98, 152:98, 153:2, 170:2. The buffers used were: buffer A: water + 0.1% formic acid and buffer B: 80% acetonitrile + 0.08% formic acid (v/v). The eluent was directed into an Easy-Spray source (Thermo Scientific) with temperature set at 50˚C and a source voltage of 1.9 kV. Data was acquired on OrbiTrap Velos Pro with precursor scan ranged from 335 to 1800 m/z at 60,000 resolution and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6. The isolation window was set to 2 Th. The top 15 most intense multiply charged precursors were selected for Collision-induced dissociation (CID) with Normalized coll. Energy set at 35.0% using wide band activation mode for MS2.  For accurate mass measurement, the "lock mass" function (lock mass = 445.120024 Da) was enabled for MS scan modes.  The resulting data were searched against the SwissProt database with species set to Mus musculus on an in house Mascot server (Matrix Science; 2016) in ProteomeDiscoverer (ThermoFisher Scientific, V. 2.1). Search parameters included peptide modifications for carbamidomethylation (C) as static modification and oxidation (M, P and K) as well as deamination (N, Q) as dynamic modification. A decoy database search was performed to determine the peptide FDR with the Percolator module. A 1% peptide FDR threshold was applied, and peptides were filtered for high peptide confidence, minimum peptide length of 6, and finally peptides without protein reference were removed. Protein grouping was performed by applying strict parsimony principles.

### Data Protocol
Raw spectras were analysed in proteome discoverer V2.1 with modifications described as above in "sample processing protocol". Raw data was then exported and analysed using the open source software package R (V4.0.0). In brief, only proteins with "high" FDR confidence and at least >= 2 unique peptides/protein were included in the analysis. For the final set, only those proteins identified in 3/4 (KPC-1) or 2/3 (HPDE) biological replicates were included in the analysis.
