### Title
Phenotyping CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia using freezer-induced patient urine sediments

### Description
Using freezer-induced urine sediments, we show that we can perform regular proteomics after glycosaminoglycan digests and proteome digestion on PVDF membrane.

### Sample Protocol
Urine samples were frozen after collection, and thaw for analysis. The sediments after defrosting are collected by pelleting and referred to as freezer-induced urine sediments. An aliquot of the sediments were reduced and alkylated and vacuum blotted onto PVDF membrane for GAG release. After GAG release, the membranes were added with trypsin to digest the proteins, and the peptides were extracted and cleaned for LC-MS

### Data Protocol
The Sequest search was carried out via ProteomeDiscoverer2.5, using the reviewed Human proteome database, and a second database that includes the glycosaminoglycan lyase enzymes.
