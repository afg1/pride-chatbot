### Title
SANS (USH1G) regulates pre-mRNA splicing by mediating the intra-nuclear transfer of tri-snRNP complexes

### Description
Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a compositionally dynamic complex assembled stepwise on pre-mRNA. We reveal links between splicing machinery components and the intrinsically disordered ciliopathy protein SANS. Pathogenic mutations in SANS/USH1G lead to Usher syndrome––the most common cause of deaf-blindness. Previously, SANS was shown to function only in the cytosol and primary cilia. Here, we have uncovered molecular links between SANS and pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome in the nucleus. We show that SANS is found in Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles, where it interacts with components of spliceosomal subcomplexes such as SF3B1 and the large splicing cofactor SON but also with PRPFs and snRNAs related to the tri-snRNP complex. SANS is required for the transfer of tri-snRNPs between Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles for spliceosome assembly and may also participate in snRNP recycling back to Cajal bodies. SANS depletion alters the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of complex A. SANS deficiency and USH1G pathogenic mutations affects splicing of genes related to cell proliferation and USH. Thus, we provide the first evidence that splicing dysregulation may participate in the pathophysiology of Usher syndrome.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were separated on 4â€“12% Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and stained with G-colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Entire lanes of the Coomassie-stained gel was cut into 23 slices and processed for mass spectrometry as previously described (Fabrizio et al., 2009).

### Data Protocol
Raw acquisition files were searched with Mascot against the Uniprot human database (48705 entries) with default parameters were and further processed with Scaffold.
