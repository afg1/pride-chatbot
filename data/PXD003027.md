### Title
AD+CVD temporal lobe proteome -  Gender differences in white matter pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease

### Description
Unbiased discovery-driven quantitative proteomics was performed to profile expression changes and degenerative modifications in the temporal lobe proteome (BA21) of AD+CVD patients compared to normal age-matched controls.

### Sample Protocol
Approximately 10 milligrams of brain tissue from each subject was homogenized in 1% SDS buffer using a tissue homogenizer.Two-hundred micrograms of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. Gel bands were cut a,d proteins were reduced (Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride, 5 mM), alkylated (methyl methanethiosulfonate, 10 mM) and dehydrated. Samples were digested overnight with trypsin.  4-plex iTRAQ reagent Multiplex kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Tags were distributed as follows; 114 = controls; 116 = women; 117 = men. Samples were HPLC fractionated by a PolyWAX LP column and fractions were combined according to peak intensities previously recorded at 280nm.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a QSTAR Elite mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) coupled with online nanoflow multidimensional liquid chromatography system (MDLC).MS/MS data searching was performed using the concatenated target-decoy Uniprot database in ProteinPilot software 3.0 (revision number 114732; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with Paragon (3.0.0.0, 113442) and Pro Group algorithms implemented.
