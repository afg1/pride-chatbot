### Title
Proteogenomics of Microbacterium sp. HG3 strain to study its response to uranium

### Description
This project is a proteomic comparison of Microbacterium sp. HG3 exposed to 10 µM nitrate uranyl versus control condition without uranyl. Three sampling time points (30 min, 4h and 24h) were analyzed. The datasets were obtained using a protein database derived from the Microbacterium sp. HG3 complete genome.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE, sliced into polyacrylamide bands, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer with a 180-min gradient time.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed using MASCOT Daemon search engine, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
