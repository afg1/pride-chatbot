### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis of Toxoplasma gondii mutants of the mitochondrial and plastidic Iron sulfur cluster synthesis pathways.

### Description
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic protist that is the agent of toxoplasmosis. It is capable of infecting all mammals, including humans. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients, but in case of immunosuppression or for the congenital form of toxoplasmosis it can lead to severe pathologies with a possible fatal outcome. T. gondii contains two organelles of endosymbiotic origin: the mitochondrion and the apicoplast, which is a non-photosynthetic plastid. These organelles contain important biochemical pathways which might be interesting targets for future therapeutic strategies. Iron-sulfur clusters are one of the most ancient and ubiquitous prosthetic groups, and they are required by a variety of proteins involved in important metabolic processes. As for plants, T. gondii has several pathways for biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins, located in three different cellular compartments: the cytoplasm, the mitochondrion and the apicoplast.  We have investigated the relative contributions of the mitochondrion and the apicoplast to the iron-sulfur proteome of the parasite by generating specific mutants for key proteins of the mitochondrial (TgIscU) and plastidic (TgSufS) pathways, on which we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Parasites of the TATi ΔKu80 and cKD TgIscU-HA cell lines were grown for two days in the presence of ATc; parasites of the cKD TgSufS-HA were grown for three days in the presence of ATc. Then they were mechanically released from their host cells, purified on a glass wool fiber column, washed in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco). Samples were first normalized on parasite counts, and further adjustment was performed after parasite pellet resuspension in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mm EDTA pH8, 1% SDS) and protein quantification with a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Abcam). For each condition, 20 µg of total proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE run for 20 min at 100 V, stained with colloidal blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and each lane was cut in three identical fractions. Digestion was performed overnight at 37°C then peptides were extracted by addition 100 µl formic acid (FA) 2%.  Digests were first vortexed for 10 minutes and supernatants were transferred into 100µl glass insert. Gel bands were extracted twice by addition of 150 µL of 50% ACN and FA 2%, followed by a final extraction with 100 µl 100% CAN. After solvent evaporation in a vacuum centrifuge, peptides were suspended in 10 µl FA 2% before LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The .raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 using default settings. The minimal peptide length was set to 6. The criteria “Trypsin/P” (which means C-terminus peptides of “K/R” unless followed by “P”: “K/R” followed by “P” cannot be a cleavage site) was chosen as digestion enzyme. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine, N-terminal-pyroglutamylation of glutamine and glutamate and acetylation (protein N terminus) as variable modifications. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed. The mass tolerance for the precursor was 20 and 4.5 ppm for the first and the main searches respectively, and for the fragment ions was 20 ppm. The files were searched against Toxoplasma gondi (March 2020 -https: //www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005641-8450 entries). Identified proteins were filtered according to the following criteria: at least two different trypsin peptides with at least one unique peptide, an E value below 0.01 and a protein E value smaller than 0.01 were required. Using the above criteria, the rate of false peptide sequence assignment and false protein identification were lower than 1%.  Peptide ion intensity values derived from MaxQuant were subjected for label-free quantitation. Unique and razor peptides were considered (Cox & Mann, 2008). Statistical analyses were carried out using R package software. ANOVA test with threshold of 0.05 was applied to identify the significant differences in the protein abundance, followed by a Tukey test. Hits were retained if they were quantified in at least three of the four replicates in at least one experiment.
