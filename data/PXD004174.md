### Title
Label-free Quantification of Proteins in Single Embryonic Cells with Neural Fate in the Cleavage-Stage Frog (Xenopus laevis) Embryo using CE-ESI-HRMS

### Description
In this work, we integrate capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, bottom-up proteomics, and single-cell microanalysis to enable the label-free quantification (LFQ) of proteins in single embryonic cells (D11 blastomeres) in the 16-cell frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo. Based on the LFQ data, we find translational differences between the blastomeres even within the same cell type.

### Sample Protocol
Single blastomeres were isolated, lysed, and their proteins extracted. The extracts were reduced, alkylated, and digested. The digest was lyophilized and suspended in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% acetic acid. The resulting peptides were separated by a custom-designed capillary electrophoresis interface against a background electrolyte containing 25% acetonitrile and 1 M formic acid. Peptides were ionized by a micro-electrospray interface operated in the cone-jet spraying regime. Peptide ions were mass-analyzed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer equipped with a quadrupole time-of-flight (Impact HD, Bruker) or orbitrap-quadrupole-linear ion trap (Fusion, thermo) analyzer.

### Data Protocol
The proteomic mass spectrometry data were processed in MaxQuant using Andromeda search engine against the Xenopus proteomic database downloaded from Xenbase.org. Standard peptide and protein search parameters were used; these are provided in the manuscript. Peptide and protein matches were filtered at <1% false discovery rate.

### Publication Abstract
Quantification of protein expression in single cells promises to advance a systems-level understanding of normal development. Using a bottom-up proteomic workflow and multiplexing quantification by tandem mass tags, we recently demonstrated relative quantification between single embryonic cells (blastomeres) in the frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo. In this study, we minimize derivatization steps to enhance analytical sensitivity and use label-free quantification (LFQ) for single Xenopus cells. The technology builds on a custom-designed capillary electrophoresis microflow-electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry platform and LFQ by MaxLFQ (MaxQuant). By judiciously tailoring performance to peptide separation, ionization, and data-dependent acquisition, we demonstrate an &#x223c;75-amol (&#x223c;11 nm) lower limit of detection and quantification for proteins in complex cell digests. The platform enabled the identification of 438 nonredundant protein groups by measuring 16 ng of protein digest, or &lt;0.2% of the total protein contained in a blastomere in the 16-cell embryo. LFQ intensity was validated as a quantitative proxy for protein abundance. Correlation analysis was performed to compare protein quantities between the embryo and n = 3 different single D11 blastomeres, which are fated to develop into the nervous system. A total of 335 nonredundant protein groups were quantified in union between the single D11 cells spanning a 4 log-order concentration range. LFQ and correlation analysis detected expected proteomic differences between the whole embryo and blastomeres, and also found translational differences between individual D11 cells. LFQ on single cells raises exciting possibilities to study gene expression in other cells and models to help better understand cell processes on a systems biology level.
