### Title
Substrate identification of ADAMTS16

### Description
Secreted and cell-surface proteases are major mediators of extracellular matrix remodelling, but their mechanisms and regulatory impact are poorly understood. We developed a mass spectrometry approach using cell free ECM produced by mouse Balb/c 3T3 cells in vitro to identify fibronectin as a novel substrate of the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS16. ADAMTS16 cleaves fibronectin between its (I)5 and (I)6 modules, releasing the N-terminal 30kDa heparin-binding domain essential for fibronectin assembly.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were TCA precipitated and digested in solution. One step digest: LysC Tandem digest:LysC+trypsin, LysC+AspN, trypsin+AspN Reduction and alkylation of cystein residues using TCEP and iodoacetamide  For human FN samples: Samples were TCA precipitated and digested in solution.

### Publication Abstract
Secreted and cell-surface proteases are major mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, but their mechanisms and regulatory impact are poorly understood. We developed a mass spectrometry approach using a cell-free ECM produced <i>in vitro</i> to identify fibronectin (FN) as a novel substrate of the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS16. ADAMTS16 cleaves FN between its (I)<sub>5</sub> and (I)<sub>6</sub> modules, releasing the N-terminal 30 kDa heparin-binding domain essential for FN self-assembly. ADAMTS16 impairs FN fibrillogenesis as well as fibrillin-1 and tenascin-C assembly, thus inhibiting formation of a mature ECM by cultured fibroblasts. Furthermore ADAMTS16 has a marked morphogenetic impact on spheroid formation by renal tubule-derived MDCKI cells. The N-terminal FN domain released by ADAMTS16 up-regulates MMP3, which cleaves the (I)<sub>5</sub>-(I)<sub>6</sub> linker of FN similar to ADAMTS16, therefore creating a proteolytic feed-forward mechanism. Thus, FN proteolysis not only regulates FN turnover, but also FN assembly, with potential long-term consequences for ECM assembly and morphogenesis.
