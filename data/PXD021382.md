### Title
Interactome analysis of Aedes aegypti PIWI proteins

### Description
PIWI-interacting (pi) RNAs are a class of small RNAs that have diverse functions in mosquitoes. In order to uncover novel components involved in biogenesis or function of the piRNA pathway in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, we performed mass spectrometry analyses on immunoprecipitated PIWI proteins and their interactors.

### Sample Protocol
Aag2 cells stably expressing eGFP-tagged PIWI proteins were generated. These cells were expanded, lysed and PIWI proteins were immunoprecipitated using GFP-TRAP beads. After stringent washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to on-bead digestion, after which peptides were acidified and desalted. Subsequently, peptides were analyzed using reverse phase chromatography on an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) coupled online with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). MS and MS2 data were recorded using TOP10 data-dependent acquisition during a 140 minute gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were analyzed using Maxquant version 1.5.1.0. using standard recommended settings. LFQ, IBAQ and match between runs were enabled. Data were mapped to the Ae. aegypti AaegL5.2 proteome downloaded from VectorBase (www.vectorbase.org). Identified proteins were filtered for contaminants and reverse hits. LFQ-values were subsequently log2-transformed. Samples were divided in triplicates and filtered to have at least 3 valid values in one group of replicates. Missing values were imputed assuming a normal distribution. The output of t-tests performed with default setting was used to generate volcano plots in R.
