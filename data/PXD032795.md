### Title
Synechocystis-Hik28 stress response

### Description
Comparative proteome analysis of the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (WT) and Hik28 deletion mutant under combined stress of low-/high- growth temperature and nitrogen stress to elucidate the stress response mechanism regulated by a two component system, Hik28.

### Sample Protocol
The WT and delta(Hik28) cells were harvested at 30oC, 16oC and 45oC for 0, 1 and 24 h. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice. Subsequently 1 volume of the supernatants was concentrated by adding 9 volume of absolute ethanol and incubated at -20oC for 16 h. Then the protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm 4oC for 30 min. The protein pellets were dissolved with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5. The proteins concentration was measured by using the 2D-Quant kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences USA). The protein from both strains were extracted and digested with the enzyme, trypsin, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. After the peptide samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the MS/MS search used high stringency criteria. Then, Spectrum Mill were performed for protein identification by using Synechocystis database. The proteins with a differential expression level equal to or more than 1.5 (โ�ฅ1.5) were considered as up-regulated proteins and the expression level equal to or less than 1.5 (โ�ค1.5) were considered as down-regulated proteins.

### Data Protocol
The raw data obtained from LC-MS/MS was in .d file. MS/MS spectra extraction and MS/MS search for protein/peptide identification were carried out by using Spectrum Mill program version B.05.00.180 in the file-format of .mzXML and tagSummary.tsv, respectively. Then, the comparative proteome analyses were done by using Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) program version 15.0.

### Publication Abstract
Synechocystis histidine kinase, Sll0474: Hik28, a signal protein in a two-component signal transduction system, plays a critical role in responding to a decrease in growth temperature and is also involved in nitrogen metabolism. In the present study, under combined stress from non-optimal growth temperature and nitrogen depletion, a comparative proteomic analysis of the wild type (WT) and a deletion mutant (MT) of Synechocystis histidine kinase, Sll0474: Hik28, in a two-component signal transduction system identified the specific groups of ABC transporters that were Hik28-dependent, e.g., the iron transporter, and Hik28-independent, e.g., the phosphate transporter. The iron transporter, AfuA, was found to be upregulated only in the WT strain grown under the combined stress of high temperature and nitrogen depletion. Whereas, the expression level of the phosphate transporter, PstS, was increased in both the WT and MT strains. Moreover, the location in the genome of the genes encoding Hik28 and ABC transporters in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were analyzed in parallel with the comparative proteomic data. The results suggested the regulation of the ABC transporters by the gene in a two-component system located in an adjacent location in the genome.
