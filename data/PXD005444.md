### Title
Quantitative proteomic profiling of fibroblasts in oesophageal adenocarcinoma

### Description
The accumulatiob of cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumours correlates with poor prognosis across cancer types including oesophageal adenocarcinoma. In this study we examined the proteomic profile of cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts.

### Sample Protocol
Six week old C57B1/6 mice were treated with Anti-Dll4 Ab, a gamma secretase inhibitor or control antibody (Hfc). Pancreas was isolated, suspended in 0.5M TEAB, 0.05% SDS, subjected to tip sonication, centrifuged and supernatant moved in fresh tubes. Eluates were quantitaed for protein content and 100ug of protein from each of the eight samples was subjected to reduction, alkylation, trypsin proteolysis and iTRAQ labeling. Labeled peptides were mixed and analysed using offline LC and online LC-MS techniques.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were submitted to Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for target decoy search using Sequest against the mouse TREMBL database. Ratios were log2 transformed and median normalized. Co-isolation percentage excluding peptides from quantitation was set at 30.
