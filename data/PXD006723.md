### Title
TMT10-TAILS investigation of the proteolytic landscape in B cell activation

### Description
The N-terminome in EBV-B cells from a human patient homozygous for an W580S mutation in MALT1 were analyzed by TMT10-plex TAILS and compared to EBV-B cells from heterozygous subjects under resting and PMA/ionomycin stimulation for 2 and 4 h.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed, and 200 ug of the resulting proteomes for each condition was labeled with TMT-10 at the protein level. After trypsin digestion, N-terminal peptides were enriched by depleting internal, unblocked tryptic peptides with an aldehyde functionalized HPG TAILS polymer. A sample prior to digestion ("preTAILS") was taken for each sample to control for protein abundance changes. Desalted TAILS and preTAILS samples were analysed by nano-LC-MS on an easy-nLC system hyphenated to an Orbitrap fusion mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data was analysed through Proteome Discoverer 2.0 with a Byonic node. Spectra were searched against the complete Swiss-Prot human database (release 2013_08) at a 1% protein level FDR. Resulting peptide lists were filtered for peptides identified with a probability greater than 0.99.
