### Title
Discovery of potential early colorectal cancer biomarker

### Description
Differential analysis of proteomes originated from early lesion of colorectal cancer and colon control tissue using FFPE-FASPTM and Label free analysis using 2DnanoUPLC separation before analysis on a qTOF synapt HDMS G2 using ion mobility as supplementary separation dimension

### Sample Protocol
FFPE-FASP TM was used to generate protein digest. All samples were injected on a 2D-nanoAquity UPLC (Waters, Corp., Milford, USA) coupled online with a Q-Tof Synapt HDMSTM G2 system (Waters, Corp, Milford, USA) using ion mobility as an additional separation.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed (deconvoluted, deisotoped), proteins identified/quantified and the differential analysis using relative quantification were all performed with Nonlinear Dynamics’ Progenesis software, version 1.1.4.8.32.42.175 (Waters, Newcastle on Tyne, UK).
