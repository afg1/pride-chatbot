### Title
Identification of protein interaction partners of the lncRNA Lassie

### Description
The shear stress-regulated lncRNA LASSIE interferes with endothelial cell function as knockdown of Lassie affects apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenic sprouting in vitro. RNA-antisense purification and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identifed junctional proteins (such as PECAM-1) as interactors of LASSIE . Additional functional analyses demonstrate a role of LASSIE in shear stress sensing and barrier function in endothelial cells, by stabilizing endothelial cell junctions through connection to the cytoskeleton.

### Sample Protocol
HUVECs (one confluent 15 cm dish/condition) were lysed (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 % NP-40, protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 16000 x g, 4 °C), adjusted to a volume of 1 ml (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 80 U RNase inhibitor) and pre-cleared for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 µl pre-blocked (glycogen and yeast tRNA (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C) streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Scientific). RNA-protein (RNP) complexes were isolated by incubating lysates with 100 pmol 2′O-Me-RNA anti-LASSIE and non-targeting control oligonucleotides for 1 h at 37 °C. RNP-oligonucleotide complexes were captured using 100 μl pre-blocked beads for 1 h at 37 °C. Beads were washed four times (lysis buffer containing 0.05 % NP-40) followed by Biotin (100 μM) elution for 1 h at RT.  Eluat was diluted  2-fold with 8M Urea, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5 and thiols were reduced with 10 mM DTT. Samples were incubated at 22°C for 30 min. Reduced thiols were alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamid and samples were diluted with 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10% acetonitrile to obtain a final urea concentration of 2 M.  Proteins were digested with 1 µg Trypsin/LysC (sequencing grade, Promega) overnight at 22°C under gentle agitation. Beads were resuspended in 20 µl 6M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mM DTT and incubated at 95°C for 5 min. Reduced thiols were alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamid and sample were diluted with 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10% acetonitrile to obtain a final GdmCl concentration of 0.6 M. Proteins were digested with 1 µg Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) overnight at 37°C under gentle agitation. Digestion was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.5 %. Peptides were loaded on multi-stop-and-go tip (StageTip) containing six  C18-disks . Purification and elution of peptides was performed as described in Rappsilber and Mann (2007). Peptides  were eluted in wells of microtiter plates and peptides were dried and resolved in 1% acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid.   Liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed on Thermo Scientific™ Q Exactive Plus equipped with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography unit (Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000) and a Nanospray Flex Ion-Source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a C18 reversed-phase precolumn (Thermo Scientific) followed by separation on a with 2.4 µm Reprosil C18 resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH) in-house packed picotip emitter tip (diameter 100 µm, 15 cm long from New Objectives) using an gradient from mobile phase A (4% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 60 % mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 60 min with a flow rate 300 nl/min. MS data were recorded by data dependent acquisition Top10 method selecting the most abundant precursor ions in positive mode for HCD fragmentation. The Full MS scan range was 300 to 2000 m/z with resolution of 70000, and an automatic gain control (AGC) value of 3*E6 total ion counts with a maximal ion injection time of 160 ms. Only higher charged ions (2+) were selected for MS/MS scans with a resolution of 17500, an isolation window of 2 m/z and an automatic gain control value set to E5 ions with a maximal ion injection time of 150 ms. Selected ions were excluded in a time frame of 30s following fragmentation event. Fullscan data were acquired in profile and fragments in centroid mode by Xcalibur software.

### Data Protocol
For data analysis MaxQuant 1.5.3.30 (Cox and Mann, 2008, Nat. Biotechnology), Perseus 1.5.6.0 (Tyranova et al 2016) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2013) were used. N-terminal acetylation (+42.01) and oxidation of methionine (+15.99) were selected as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation (+57.02) on cysteines as a fixed modification. The human reference proteome set (Uniprot, December 2016, 70947 entries) was used to identify peptides and proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1%. Minimal ratio count for label-free quantification (LFQ) was 1. Reverse identifications and common contaminants were removed and the data-set was reduced to proteins that were identified in at least 4 of 5 samples in one experimental group. Missing values were replaced by random background values. Samples were normalized to median.  Significant interacting proteins were determined by permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) calculation.  Rappsilber J, Mann M, Ishihama Y.

### Publication Abstract
Blood vessels are constantly exposed to shear stress, a biomechanical force generated by blood flow. Normal shear stress sensing and barrier function are crucial for vascular homeostasis and are controlled by adherens junctions (AJs). Here we show that AJs are stabilized by the shear stress-induced long non-coding RNA LASSIE (linc00520). Silencing of LASSIE in endothelial cells impairs cell survival, cell-cell contacts and cell alignment in the direction of flow. LASSIE associates with junction proteins (e.g. PECAM-1) and the intermediate filament protein nestin, as identified by RNA affinity purification. The AJs component VE-cadherin showed decreased stabilization, due to reduced interaction with nestin and the microtubule cytoskeleton in the absence of LASSIE. This study identifies LASSIE as link between nestin and VE-cadherin, and describes nestin as crucial component in the endothelial response to shear stress. Furthermore, this study indicates that LASSIE regulates barrier function by connecting AJs to the cytoskeleton.
