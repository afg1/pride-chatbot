### Title
LACI Plasma Microvesicle Biomarker

### Description
The data are collected in triplicate from purified plasma microvesicles of LACI patient and matched control. the data were generated from a QStar Elite LC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
Microvesicles were isoldated from plasma using sequential centrifugation,  shotgun proteomics processed, and then labelled with 4-plex iTRAQ reagent.

### Data Protocol
Data were collected usign QStar Elite, Search the QStar wiff data using Human DB and Choose 4-plex iTRAQ peptide using ProteinPilot v3 software.
