### Title
MYL3 protects chondrocytes from senescence by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and activating of Notch signaling

### Description
As the unique cell type in articular cartilage, chondrocyte senescence is a crucial cellular event contributing to osteoarthritis development. Here we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and activation of Notch signaling promotes chondrocyte senescence and osteoarthritis development, which is negatively regulated by myosin light chain 3. Myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) protein levels decline sharply in senescent chondrocytes of cartilages from model mice and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Conditional deletion of Myl3 in chondrocytes significantly promoted, whereas intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus overexpressing MYL3 delayed, OA progression in male mice. MYL3 deficiency led to enhanced clathrin-mediated endocytosis by promoting the interaction between myosin VI and clathrin, further inducing the internalization of Notch and resulting in activation of Notch signaling in chondrocytes. Pharmacologic blockade of clathrin-mediated endocytosis-Notch signaling prevented MYL3 loss-induced chondrocyte senescence and alleviated OA progression in mice. Our results establish a previously unknown mechanism essential for cellular senescence and provide a potential therapeutic direction for OA.

### Sample Protocol
Articular cartilage was carefully isolated from 2- and 12-month-old mice (n=3 independent biological replicates per group) with micro-scissors under a stereoscopic microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), subchondral bones were removed and isolated articular cartilage was washed with PBS. Samples were lyophilized overnight and stored at −80 °C until shipment to the PGME Bio (Guangzhou, China) to perform LC–MS/MS. The sample was prepared by grinding it into cell powder using liquid nitrogen. Four volumes of lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail were added to the cell powder and sonicated for three minutes on ice using a high-intensity ultrasonic processor. After sonication, the debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g and 4 °C for 10 minutes. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a BCA kit, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The protein sample encountered pre-cooled acetone treatment. Initially, one volume of acetone was used, followed by four volumes, resulting in precipitation at -20℃ for a duration of 2 hours. The precipitate underwent 2-3 rounds of washing with pre-cooled acetone. Subsequently, the protein sample was dissolved in 200 mM TEAB and dispersed through the application of ultrasonication. Trypsin was introduced at a trypsin-to-protein mass ratio of 1:50 for the first digestion, which proceeded overnight. Afterward, the sample was subjected to reduction with 5 mM dithiothreitol at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes, followed by alkylation with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 minutes in darkness at room temperature. Finally, peptide desalting was accomplished utilizing a Strata X SPE column. The tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A and loaded onto a reversed-phase analytical column that was homemade.This column had dimensions of 25 cm in length and 100 μm in inner diameter.To separate the peptides, a mobile phase was used, consisting of solvent A (water containing 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile) and solvent B (water containing 0.1% formic acid and 90% acetonitrile). The separation protocol involved a gradient as follows: 0-68 min, 6%-23% B;68-82 min, 23%-32% B;82-86 min, 32%-80% B;86-90 min, 80% B. Subsequently, the separated peptides underwent analysis by an Orbitrap Exploris 480 equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source.For further MS/MS analyses, up to 25 precursors with the highest abundance were selected while implementing a dynamic exclusion of 20 seconds. The HCD fragmentation occurred at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27%. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 100%, utilizing an intensity threshold of 50000 ions/s and a maximum injection time of Auto.

### Data Protocol
The MaxQuant search engine (v.1.6.15.0) was utilized to process the MS/MS data and generate the desired results. To perform the search, the tandem mass spectra were compared against the Mus_musculus_10090_SP_20230103.fasta database (with a total of 17132 entries). To enhance the accuracy of the search, this database was combined with a reverse decoy and contaminants database. For the enzymatic cleavage, Trypsin/P was specified, allowing for a maximum of 2 missing cleavages. Additionally, the minimum peptide length was set to 7, and each peptide was allowed to have a maximum of 5 modifications. To ensure precision, a mass tolerance of 20 ppm was applied to the precursor ions in both the first and main search. Similarly, a mass tolerance of 20 ppm was applied to the fragment ions. In terms of modifications, the fixed modification was carbamidomethyl on Cys. On the other hand, the variable modifications included acetylation on the protein N-terminal and oxidation on Met. The false discovery rate (FDR) for protein, peptide, and PSM was adjusted to be less than 1%. The Fold Change (FC) was calculated as the ratio of the mean relative quantitative values of proteins in the two groups of samples. To determine the significance of the difference, a T test was conducted on the relative quantitative values of protein in the two groups of samples, resulting in the calculation of a corresponding P value, which served as the significance index. The default threshold for significance was set at a P value < 0.05. To meet the normal distribution requirements of the T-test, the relative quantitative values of proteins were logarithmically converted using Log2 before the test. Through the above difference analysis, when P value < 0.05, the change of differential expression level was more than 1.5 as the significantly up-regulated change threshold, and less than 1/1.5 as the significantly down-regulated change threshold.
