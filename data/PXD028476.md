### Title
Guillain-Barré syndrome following Zika virus infection is associated with a diverse spectrum of peripheral nerve reactive antibodies

### Description
Recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) in South and Central America have highlighted significant neurological side effects. Concurrence with the inflammatory neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is observed in 1:4000 ZIKV cases. Whether the neurological symptoms of ZIKV infection are a consequence of autoimmunity or direct neurotoxicity is unclear.

### Sample Protocol
We employed rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, Schwann cells (SC), and stem cell-derived human sensory neurons myelinated with rat Schwann cells as cellular models to screen for peripheral nerve reactive antibodies (IgG and IgM) in sera of ZIKV patients with and without GBS. 52 ZIKV-GBS patients were compared with 134 ZIKV-infected patients, and 91 non-ZIKV controls. Positive sera were taken forward for target identification by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and candidate antigens validated by ELISA and cell-based assays. Glycolipid antigens were also screened on an array

### Data Protocol
biological replicates, sample peptide data were aligned with concatenated Human, Rat and ZIKV sequences (Human,Rat,Zika) and split using  Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics) to generate raw abundance values. Protein enrichment was quantified by transforming normalised abundance values and presented in a volcano plot using Perseus (MaxQuant) (Tyanova et al., 2016
