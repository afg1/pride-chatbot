### Title
Immunoproteasome expression is associated with better prognosis and response to checkpoint therapies in melanoma

### Description
Predicting the outcome of immunotherapy treatment in melanoma patients is challenging. Alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation and the interferon gamma (IFN) pathway play an important role in the immune response to tumors. We describe here that the overexpression of PSMB8 and PSMB9, two components of the immunoproteasome, is predictive of better survival and improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors of melanoma patients. We study the mechanism that underlies this connection by analyzing the antigenic peptide repertoire of cells that overexpress these subunits using HLA peptidomics. We find a higher response of patient-matched tumor infiltrating lymphocytes against antigens deferentially presented after immunoproteasome overexpression. which may explain the higher immune infiltration observed in patients with high immunoproteasome expression levels. Importantly, we find that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels are much stronger predictors of melanoma patients immune response to checkpoint inhibitors than the tumors mutational burden.  Taken together, these results suggest that their expression levels can serve as important biomarkers for stratifying melanoma patients for immune-checkpoint treatment.

### Sample Protocol
Purification of membrane HLA molecules For the HLA peptidomics analysis we used three experimental replicates per each cell line and each condition (empty vector/ overexpression and treated/ non-treated cells). Samples were processed as described previously. Briefly, cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2mM iodoacetamide, 1mM EDTA, 1:200 protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1mM PMSF and 1%octyl-b-D glucopyranoside in PBS, and then incubated at 4˚C for 1 hour. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4˚C and 48,000g for 60 minutes, and then passed through a pre-clearing column containing Protein-A Sepharose beads. HLA-I molecules were immunoaffinity purified from cleared lysate with the pan-HLA-I antibody (W6/32 antibody purified from HB95 hybridoma cells) covalently bound to Protein-A Sepharose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Affinity column was washed first with 10 column volumes of 400mM NaCl, 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and then with 10 volumes of 20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. The HLA peptides and HLA molecules were eluted with 1% TFA followed by separation of the peptides from the proteins by binding the eluted fraction to disposable reversed-phase C18 columns (Harvard Apparatus) as in. Elution of the peptides was done with 30% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA). The eluted peptides were cleaned also by C18 stage tip.

### Data Protocol
Identification of the eluted HLA peptides The HLA peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation, re-solubilized with 0.1% formic acid and resolved on capillary reversed phase chromatography on 075x300mm laser-pulled capillaries, self-packed with C18 reversed-phase 3.5μm beads (Reprosil-C18-Aqua, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany39). Chromatography was performed with the UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano-capillary UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was coupled by electrospray to tandem mass spectrometry on Q-Exactive-Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The HLA peptides were eluted with a linear gradient over 2 h from 5 to 28% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.15µl/min. Data was acquired using a data-dependent “top 10” method, fragmenting the peptides by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). Full scan MS spectra was acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z with a target value of 3x106 ions. Ions were accumulated to an AGC target value of 105 with a maximum injection time of generally 100 msec. The peptide match option was set to Preferred. Normalized collision energy was set to 25% and MS/MS resolution was 17,500 at 200 m/z. Fragmented m/z values were dynamically excluded from further selection for 20 sec. The MS data was analyzed by MaxQuant40 version 1.5.3.8. Peptide were searched against the UniProt human database, and customized reference databases which contained the mutated sequences identified in the sample by WES. N-terminal acetylation (42.010565 Da) and methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da) were set as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set as unspecific and peptides FDR was set to 0.05. The match between runs option was enabled to allow matching of identifications across the samples belonging the same patient.

### Publication Abstract
Predicting the outcome of immunotherapy treatment in melanoma patients is challenging. Alterations in genes involved in antigen presentation and the interferon gamma (IFN&#x3b3;) pathway play an important role in the immune response to tumors. We describe here that the overexpression of PSMB8 and PSMB9, two major components of the immunoproteasome, is predictive of better survival and improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors of melanoma patients. We study the mechanism underlying this connection by analyzing the antigenic peptide repertoire of cells that overexpress these subunits using HLA peptidomics. We find a higher response of patient-matched tumor infiltrating lymphocytes against antigens diferentially presented after immunoproteasome overexpression. Importantly, we find that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels are much stronger predictors of melanoma patients' immune response to checkpoint inhibitors than the tumors' mutational burden. These results suggest that PSMB8 and PSMB9 expression levels can serve as important biomarkers for stratifying melanoma patients for immune-checkpoint treatment.
