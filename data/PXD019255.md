### Title
Uncovering tumor-stroma inter-relationships using quantitative MALDI-Mass spectrometry imaging

### Description
To facilitate analysis of protein expression changes in in situ tumors and stroma, we took advantage of a mouse model that permits conditional activation of the Ser-Thr kinase ROCK within mammary tumor cells. In this study, we undertook MALDI-MSI analysis of tissue samples derived from our conditional ROCK mammary tumor model, to quantify in an unbiased manner, the proteomic changes occurring during the progression of mammary cancers in their specific spatial contexts.

### Sample Protocol
We previously generated a suite of transgenic mice in which ROCK can be conditionally activated in K14-positive cells with the addition of tamoxifen (K14-ROCK:mER), and corresponding kinase-dead controls (K14-KD:mER). These mice were crossed with the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model of breast cancer to generate K14-ROCK:mER;MMTV-PyMT (designated ROCK-PyMT) and K14-KD:mER;MMTV-PyMT (designated KD-PyMT) strains.

### Data Protocol
Data was acquired using an ultraflextreme MALDI-TOFTOF in positive ion mode and was analysed using SCILS LAb 2016b with weak denoising and automatatic hptspot removal applied. Raw data was processed for total ion count
