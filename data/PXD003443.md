### Title
Changes in proteome upon deletion of UBE2S/UBE2C in HCT116 cells

### Description
The proteome of HCT116 cells deleted of UBE2S and/or UBE2C was compared to the proteome of wild-type HCT116 cells.

### Sample Protocol
Wild-type HCT116 cells were grown in light SILAC medium (0/0), the respective knockout cells were grown in heavy SILAC medium (10/8). After cell lysis, equal amounts of protein were mixed from wild-type and knockout cells. Tryptic peptides for MS analysis were obtained either after fractionation of proteins by SDS-PAGE or fractionation of peptides by SCX.

### Data Protocol
The obtained MS spectra were analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.5.0.38), setting carbamidomethyl as a fixed modification and with the re-quantification option turned off.
