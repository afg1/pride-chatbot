### Title
Crystalline cellulose hydrolysis in microbial communities via actinobacterial glycoside hydrolase family 12

### Description
Proteomic data from supernatants from thermophilic cellulolytic microbial communities, for the identification of specific hydrolases from Thermobispora bispora related actinobacterium.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, labeled with 8-plex iTRAQ, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline
