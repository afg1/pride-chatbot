### Title
proteomic effects of mIR-877-3p in cervical cancer

### Description
A subcellular proteomic workflow was carried out with three biological replicates in each experimental condition, using MOCK, NC- and anti-miR-877-transfections in C-33A and SiHa cells.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed with a PBS-based buffer containing 1% NP-40 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), scraped and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. Cytoplasmic proteins in the supernatant were collected and precipitated with ice-cold acetone, while pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of lysis buffer (7M urea, 2M thiourea, and 50 mM DTT), incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated for two cycles of 20 s each. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 15°C, and nuclear proteins were collected from the supernatant. Protein concentration was measured in the supernatants with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-rad).

### Data Protocol
Protein extracts for each sample (36 samples; 18samples/cell type) was diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 0.75 mm thick polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. The run was stopped as soon as the front entered 3 mm into the resolving gel so that the whole proteome became concentrated in the stacking/resolving gel interface. Bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and excised from the gel. Protein enzymatic cleavage (20ug) was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37°C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko, A. et al., In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes. Nat Protoc 1 (6), 2856 (2006)). Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). Peptides mixtures were separated by reverse phase chromatography using an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump fitted with a 75 μm ID column (Eksigent 0.075 x 250). Samples were first loaded for desalting and concentration into a 0.5 cm length 100 μm ID precolumn packed with the same chemistry as the separating column. Mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a 240 min two step gradient from 5% B to 25% B in 210 min and 25%B to 40% B in 30 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 9 min and 5% B for 14 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using an Sciex 5600 Triple-TOF system. Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 250 ms. Top 35 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set to 100 ms giving a total cycle time of 3.8 s. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 230 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation during 15 s.  Peptide Identification and Quantification MS/MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.7.1 (Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through Protein Pilot Software (v.5.0-Sciex) using Paragon™ algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) for database search (Shilov, IV Mol Cell Prot 2007), Progroup™ for data grouping, and searched against the concatenated target-decoy UniProt proteome reference Human database (Proteome ID: UP000005640, 73045 proteins, April 2018). False discovery rate was performed using a non lineal fitting method (Tang, W. H., Shilov, I. V et al. JPR 2008) and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global false discovery rate or better. The peptide quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC−MS software (ver. 2.0.5556.29015, Nonlinear Dynamics). Using the accurate mass measurements from full survey scans in the TOF detector and the observed retention times, runs were aligned to compensate for between-run variations in our nanoLC separation system. To this end, all runs were aligned to a reference run automatically chosen by the software, and a master list of features considering m/z values and retention times was generated. The quality of these alignments was manually supervised with the help of quality scores provided by the software. The peptide identifications were exported from Protein Pilot software and imported in Progenesis LC− MS software where they were matched to the respective features. Output data files were managed with Perseus software (Tyanova S, Temu T et al. Nature Methods 2016) for statistical analyses and representation. Proteins identified by site (identification based only on a modification), reverse proteins (identified by decoy database) and potential contaminants were filtered out.

### Publication Abstract
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), biobanked tissue samples offer an invaluable resource for clinical and biomarker research. Here, we developed a pressure cycling technology (PCT)-SWATH mass spectrometry workflow to analyze FFPE tissue proteomes and applied it to the stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) samples. We show that the proteome patterns of FFPE PCa tissue samples and their analogous fresh-frozen (FF) counterparts have a high degree of similarity and we confirmed multiple proteins consistently regulated in PCa tissues in an independent sample cohort. We further demonstrate temporal stability of proteome patterns from FFPE samples that were stored between 1 and 15&#xa0;years in a biobank and show a high degree of the proteome pattern similarity between two types of histological regions in small FFPE samples, that is, punched tissue biopsies and thin tissue sections of micrometer thickness, despite the existence of a certain degree of biological variations. Applying the method to two independent DLBCL cohorts, we identified myeloperoxidase, a peroxidase enzyme, as a novel prognostic marker. In summary, this study presents a robust proteomic method to analyze bulk and biopsy FFPE tissues and reports the first systematic comparison of proteome maps generated from FFPE and FF samples. Our data demonstrate the practicality and superiority of FFPE over FF samples for proteome in biomarker discovery. Promising biomarker candidates for PCa and DLBCL have been discovered.
