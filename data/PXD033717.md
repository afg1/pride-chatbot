### Title
TbPH1/TbKifX2 depletion proteome

### Description
Kinesins are motor proteins found in all eukaryotic lineages that move along microtubules to mediate Kinesins are motor proteins found in all eukaryotic lineages that move along microtubules to mediate cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport. In trypanosomatids, the kinesin superfamily has undergone a prominent expansion, resulting in one of the most diverse kinesin repertoires that includes the two kinetoplastid-restricted families X1 and X2. Here, we characterize in Trypanosoma brucei TbKifX2A, an orphaned X2 kinesin. TbKifX2A tightly interacts with TbPH1, a kinesin-like protein with a likely inactive motor domain, a rarely reported occurrence. Both TbKifX2A and TbPH1 localize to the microtubule quartet (MtQ), a characteristic but poorly understood cytoskeletal structure that wraps around the flagellar pocket as it extends to the cell body anterior. The proximal proteome of TbPH1 revealed two other interacting proteins, the flagellar pocket protein FP45 and intriguingly another X2 kinesin, TbKifX2C. Simultaneous ablation of TbKifX2A/TbPH1 results in the depletion of FP45 and TbKifX2C and also an expansion of the flagellar pocket, among other morphological defects. TbKifX2A is the first motor protein to be localized to the MtQ. The observation that TbKifX2C also associates with the MtQ suggests that the X2 kinesin family may have co-evolved with the MtQ, both kinetoplastid-specific traits.cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport.

### Sample Protocol
TbPH1/TbKifX2A RNAi cells were induced for 3 and 5 days with doxycycline, 5x107 cells per replicate collected by centrifugation and washed once in 1x PBS before being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Non-induced and parental control samples were also processed similarly as a control. MS LFQ analysis was performed on biological triplicates. For sample prep, SP4 (Solvent Precipitation SP3) protocol without beads was used (Harvey Johnston et al., 2021; bioRxiv 2021.09.24.461247). Briefly, cell pellets (100 µg of protein) were solubilized by SDS (final concentration 1% (w/v)), reduced with TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine], alkylated with MMTS (S-methyl methanethiosulfonate) and digested sequentially with Lys-C and trypsin. Samples were desalted on Empore C18 columns, dried in a speedvac and dissolved in 0.1% TFA + 2% acetonitrile. LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples (ca. 0.5 µg of desalted peptide digests) were loaded onto a PepMap100 C18 trap column (0.3x5 mm) at a flow rate of 17.5 µl/min loading solvent (0.05% TFA, 2 % ACN) for 3 minutes. Following sample loading, peptides were separated on a 50 cm reversed-phase EASY-Spray column (ES903, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 60 minute gradient from 3% mobile phase A (0.1 % FA in H2O) to 35 % mobile phase B (0.1 % FA, 80 % ACN) at a flowrate of 300 nl/min. The MS was operated in DDA mode with a full scan set at a resolution of 60000, an AGC target of 3e6, scanning a mass range from 350 to 1500 m/z, dynamic exclusion after 1x for 60 s. Data-dependent MS2 scans with a resolution of 15000, an AGC target of 0.75e5 and a maximum fill time of 50 ms were acquired for a total cycle time of 2 seconds.

### Data Protocol
Resulting raw files were analyzed in MaxQuant (v. 1.6.17.0) with label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm MaxLFQ and match between runs feature activated (Tyanova et al., 2016; https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2016.136). FDR was set as 0.01 at all levels. TriTrypDB-56_TbruceiTREU927_AnnotatedProteins.fasta proteome file from TriTrypDB (https://tritrypdb.org, Release 56) was used. MMTS alkylated cysteine was selected as a fixed modification (Methylthio (C), composition: H(2) C S, +45.988). Variable modifications were Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term). Downstream processing of the proteinGroups.txt file was performed in Perseus v. 1.6.15.0. LFQ intensity values were log2 transformed and the rows were filtered based on valid values (min. 2 in at least one group). The obtained data was additionally processed in Perseus version 1.6.14 as described in (Zoltner et al., 2020; doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0294-2_38).

### Publication Abstract
Kinesins are motor proteins found in all eukaryotic lineages that move along microtubules to mediate cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport. In trypanosomatids, the kinesin superfamily has undergone a prominent expansion, resulting in one of the most diverse kinesin repertoires that includes the two kinetoplastid-restricted families X1 and X2. Here, we characterize in Trypanosoma brucei TbKifX2A, an orphaned X2 kinesin. TbKifX2A tightly interacts with TbPH1, a kinesin-like protein with a likely inactive motor domain, a rarely reported occurrence. Both TbKifX2A and TbPH1 localize to the microtubule quartet (MtQ), a characteristic but poorly understood cytoskeletal structure that wraps around the flagellar pocket as it extends to the cell body anterior. The proximal proteome of TbPH1 revealed two other interacting proteins, the flagellar pocket protein FP45 and intriguingly another X2 kinesin, TbKifX2C. Simultaneous ablation of TbKifX2A/TbPH1 results in the depletion of FP45 and TbKifX2C and also an expansion of the flagellar pocket, among other morphological defects. TbKifX2A is the first motor protein to be localized to the MtQ. The observation that TbKifX2C also associates with the MtQ suggests that the X2 kinesin family may have co-evolved with the MtQ, both kinetoplastid-specific traits.
