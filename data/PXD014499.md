### Title
Molecular basis of b-adrenergic regulation of cardiac calcium current

### Description
Increased cardiac contractility during fight-or-flight response is caused by b-adrenergic augmentation of CaV1.2 channels. It is assumed that this iconic regulation involves phosphorylation of CaV1.2 a1/b-subunits. In transgenic murine hearts expressing fully PKA phosphorylation-deficient mutant a1C/b, this regulation persists, however, suggesting involvement of extra-channel factors. We here show that PKA up-regulates cardiac CaV1.2 channels by phosphorylating the small G-protein Rad, relieving constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2. Peroxidase-catalyzed labeling in mice hearts expressing ascorbate peroxidase conjugated-a1C or b2b with multiplexed quantitative proteomics allowed tracking of thousands of proteins in proximity of CaV1.2.

### Sample Protocol
Isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes were incubated in labeling solution with biotin-phenol (for 30 minutes. During the final 10 minutes of labeling, isoproterenol was added.  To initiate labeling, H2O2 was added for 1 min.  Exactly 1 minute after H2O2 treatment, the labeling solution was decanted and cells were washed three times with cold quenching solution. The cells or whole heart tissue were lysed. A detailed protocol of denaturing purification of biotin-labeled proteins and preparation of mass spec samples used was published recently (“APEX Peroxidase-Catalyzed Proximity Labeling and Multiplexed Quantitative Proteomics.“, Kalocsay M., 2019).

### Data Protocol
Peptides were searched with a SEQUEST (v.28, rev. 12) based software against a size-sorted forward and reverse database of the m. musculus proteome with added common contaminant proteins. For this, spectra were first converted to mzXML. Searches were performed using a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for precursors and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.9 Da. For the searches maximally 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. We searched dynamically for oxidized methionine residues (+15.9949 Da) and where indicated for phospho-modification of S,T and Y residues (+79.9663 Da). We applied a target decoy database strategy and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was set for peptide-spectrum matches following filtering by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The FDR for final collapsed proteins was 1%.  A modified version of the Ascore algorithm was used to quantify the confidence assignment of phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation localized to particular residues required Ascore values > 13 (p ≤ 0.05) for confident localization. Quantitative information on peptides was derived from MS3 scans.

### Publication Abstract
Increased cardiac contractility during the fight-or-flight response is caused by &#x3b2;-adrenergic augmentation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 voltage-gated calcium channels<sup>1-4</sup>. However, this augmentation persists in transgenic murine hearts expressing mutant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 &#x3b1;<sub>1C</sub> and &#x3b2; subunits that can no longer be phosphorylated by protein kinase A-an essential downstream mediator of &#x3b2;-adrenergic signalling-suggesting that non-channel factors are also required. Here we identify the mechanism by which &#x3b2;-adrenergic agonists stimulate voltage-gated calcium channels. We express &#x3b1;<sub>1C</sub> or &#x3b2;<sub>2B</sub> subunits conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase<sup>5</sup> in mouse hearts, and use multiplexed quantitative proteomics<sup>6,7</sup> to track hundreds of proteins in the proximity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. We observe that the calcium-channel inhibitor Rad<sup>8,9</sup>, a monomeric G protein, is enriched in the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 microenvironment but is depleted during &#x3b2;-adrenergic stimulation. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A of specific serine residues on Rad decreases its affinity for &#x3b2; subunits and relieves constitutive inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, observed as an increase in channel open probability. Expression of Rad or its homologue Rem in HEK293T cells also imparts stimulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 by protein kinase A, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that confers adrenergic modulation upon voltage-gated calcium channels.
