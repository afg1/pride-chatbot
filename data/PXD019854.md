### Title
Data-independent acquisition method for ubiquitinome analysis reveals non-degrative regulation of circadian biology

### Description
Protein ubiquitination is involved in virtually all cellular processes. Enrichment strategies employing antibodies targeting ubiquitin-derived diGly remnants combined with mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled investigations of ubiquitin signaling at a large scale. However, so far the power of data independent (DIA) acquisition with regards to sensitivity in single run analysis and data completeness have not yet been explored. We developed a sensitive workflow combining diGly antibody-based enrichment, optimized Orbitrap-based DIA with comprehensive spectral libraries together containing more than 90,000 diGly peptides. This approach identified 35,000 diGly peptides in single measurements of proteasome inhibitor-treated cells â€“ double the number and quantitative accuracy of data dependent acquisition. Applied to TNF-alpha signaling, the workflow comprehensively captured known sites while adding many novel ones. A first systems-wide investigation of ubiquitination of the circadian cycle uncovered hundreds of cycling ubiquitination sites and dozens of cycling ubiquitin clusters within individual membrane protein receptors and transporters, highlighting novel connections between metabolism and circadian regulation.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and boiled in lysis buffer (1% SDC in 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5) for 5 min at 95Â°C. After addition of CAA and TCEP to a final concentration of 10 mM and 40 mM, respectively, samples were incubated for 5 min at 45Â°C for protein reduction and alkylation. Thereafter, samples were digested overnight at 37Â°C using trypsin (1:100 w/w, Sigma-Aldrich) and LysC (1/100 w/w, Wako). For proteome analysis, sample aliquots were desalted in SDB-RPS StageTips (Empore). For diGly peptide enrichment, samples were four-fold diluted with 1% TFA in isopropanol and washed on SDB-RPS cartridges (Strataâ„¢-X-C, 30 mg/ 3 ml or Strataâ„¢-X-C, 200 mg/ 6 ml, Phenomenex Inc.). After washing and elution, peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in immunoaffinity purification buffer (IAP) (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaCl) for diGly peptide enrichment using the PTMScanÂ® Ubiquitin Remnant Motif (K-É›-GG) Kit (Cell Signaling Technology (CST)). Peptides were incubated with antibody beads for 1h at 4Â°C, where after beads were washed twice with cold IAP and 5 times with cold ddH2O. Peptides were eluted twice with 50Âµl 0.15% TFA and desalted on SDB-RPS StageTips.  For diGly peptide and proteome spectral library generation samples were fractionated by basic reversed phase (bRP) fractionation on an UFLC system (Shimadzu) and EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany), respectively. For diGly peptide separation, lyophilized samples were resuspended in Buffer A (5mM NH4HCO2/ 2% ACN), 5 mg peptide material (5mg/ml) was loaded onto a reversed phase column (ZORBAX 300Extend-C18, Agilent) and fractionated into 96 fractions. For peptide fractionation on the EASY-nLC 1000 system, approximately 55 Âµg peptide material were loaded onto a 30 cm in-house packed, reversed phase columns (250 Î¼m inner diameter, ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 Î¼m resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). Peptides were eluted and concatenated into 24 fractions by switching the rotor valve of an automated concatenation system (Spider fractionator, PreOmics) (Kulak et al., 2017).

### Data Protocol
DDA raw data used for K48-peptide fraction identification and DIA and DDA comparisons were analyzed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.10) using default settings and enabled match between runs (MBR) functionality. Carbamidomethyl (C) was defined as fixed modification and Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term) and DiGly (K) were set as variable modifications.   DDA raw data, used for spectral library construction, were processed with Spectronauts build in search engine pulsar (13.12.200217.43655). Default settings were used for proteome spectral libraries. For diGly spectral libraries the â€œBest N Fragments per peptidesâ€� maximum value was adjusted to 25. For hybrid library construction DIA raw files were processed together with DDA library raw files using the same search settings.  DIA raw files were processed using Spectronaut (13.12.200217.43655). Proteome analysis was performed with default settings. For diGly analysis, diGly (K) was defined as an additional variable modification and PTM localization was enabled and set to 0. For dilution experiments, â€œXIC RT extraction windowâ€� was set to â€œstaticâ€� with a window width of 10 min. Direct DIA searches used the same settings as described above.
