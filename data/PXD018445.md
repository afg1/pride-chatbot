### Title
Using instrument logic to improve identifications in low stoichiometry SILAC/TMT experiments

### Description
Pulsed SILAC approaches allow measurement of protein dynamics, including protein translation and degradation. However, its use in quantifying acute changes has been limited due the low labeled peptide stoichiometry. Here, we describe the use of instrument logic to select peaks of interest via targeted mass differences (TMD) for overcoming this limitation. Comparing peptides artificially mixed at low heavy-to-light stoichiometry measured using standard data dependent acquisition with or without TMD revealed 2-3 fold increases in identification without significant loss in quantification precision for both MS2 and MS3 methods. Our benchmarked method approach increases throughput by reducing the necessary machine time. We anticipate that all pulsed SILAC measurements, if combined with TMT or not, would greatly benefit from instrument logic based approaches.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis as described previously10. After sample preparation 1µg of peptide was resuspended in 2% Acetonitrile (ACN)/1% Formic acid (FA) and separated on an Easy nLCII (Ther-mo Fisher Scientific) and a 25cm long, 75µM ID fused-silica column, which has been packed in house with 3µM C18 particles (ReproSil-Pur, Dr.Maisch) and kept at 45°C. Peptides were eluted by a non-linear gradient from 4-32% ACN over 142min and sprayed directly into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 software (ThermoFisher Scientific). Spectra were select-ed using default settings and database searches performed using SequestHT node in PD. Database searches were per-formed against trypsin digested databases (Homo Sapiens SwissProt database (TaxID:9606, 2017-06-07/2018-11-21) or Mus musculus database (TaxID:10090, 2017-07-05)) and FASTA files of common contaminants (`contam-inants.fasta` provided with MaxQuant) for quality control. Fixed modifications were set as TMT6 at the N-terminus and carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues. As dynamic modifications TMT6 (K), TMT6+K8 (K, +237.177), Arg10 (R, +10.008) and methionine oxidation were set. After search, posterior error probabilities were calculated and PSMs filtered using Percolator using default settings. Con-sensus Workflow for reporter ion quantification was per-formed with default settings, except the minimal signal-to-noise ratio was set to 5. Results were then exported to Excel files for further processing. Excel files were used as input for a custom made in-house Python pipeline. Python 3.6 was used together with the following packages: pandas 0.23.4 11, numpy 1.15.4 12, scipy 1.3.0.

### Publication Abstract
Pulsed Stable Isotope Labeling in Cell culture (SILAC) approaches allow measurement of protein dynamics, including protein translation and degradation. However, its use for quantifying acute changes has been limited due to low labeled peptide stoichiometry. Here, we describe the use of instrument logic to select peaks of interest via targeted mass differences (TMD) for overcoming this limitation. Comparing peptides artificially mixed at low heavy-to-light stoichiometry measured using standard data dependent acquisition with or without TMD revealed 2-3-fold increases in identification without significant loss in quantification precision for both MS<sup>2</sup> and MS<sup>3</sup> methods. Our benchmarked method approach increased throughput by reducing the necessary machine time. We anticipate that all pulsed SILAC measurements, combined with tandem mass tagging (TMT) or not, would greatly benefit from instrument logic based approaches.
