### Title
Proteomic Analysis of Hypoxic Human Lung Epithelial Cells

### Description
H441 cell proteome was sequenced via SILAC and LC-MS/MS method to identify hypoxia-responsive proteins

### Sample Protocol
Protein were isolated from normoxic or hypoxic cells followed by FASP digestion. Digested peptides were mixed in equal ratios.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were extracted, and raw files were searched against the most current Homo sapiens protein sequence database from UniprotKB using Maxquant (version 1.5.0.30) and Mascot Distiller (version 2.5.1.0) for quantification of labeled proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by lung remodeling arising from epithelial injury, aberrant fibroblast growth, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Repeated epithelial injury elicits abnormal wound repair and lung remodeling, often associated with alveolar collapse and edema, leading to focal hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia is a physiological insult that contributes to pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and define its molecular roles in profibrotic activation of lung epithelial cells. Hypoxia increased transcription of profibrotic genes and altered the proteomic signatures of lung epithelial cells. Network analysis of the hypoxic epithelial proteome revealed a crosstalk between transforming growth factor-<i>&#x3b2;</i>1 and FAK1 (focal adhesion kinase-1) signaling, which regulated transcription of galectin-1, a profibrotic molecule. Galectin-1 physically interacted with and activated FAK1 in lung epithelial cells. We developed a novel model of exacerbated PF wherein hypoxia, as a secondary insult, caused PF in mice injured with subclinical levels of bleomycin. Hypoxia elevated expression of phosphorylated FAK1, galectin-1, and <i>&#x3b1;</i>-smooth muscle actin and reduced caspase-3 activation, suggesting aberrant injury repair. Galectin-1 inhibition caused apoptosis in the lung parenchyma and reduced FAK1 activation, preventing the development of hypoxia-induced PF. Galectin-1 inhibition also attenuated fibrosis-associated lung function decline. Further, galectin-1 transcript levels were increased in the lungs of IPF patients. In summary, we have identified a profibrotic role of galectin-1 in hypoxia signaling driving PF.
