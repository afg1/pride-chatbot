### Title
PKD autoinhibition in trans prevents activation loop autophosphorylation in cis

### Description
HDX-MS analysis of the kinase domain of PKD1, showing that it forms an inactive dimer

### Sample Protocol
HDX reactions for wild-type PKD1KD and PKD1KD S738/742E were conducted in a final reaction volume of 6 µL with a final concentration of 5 µM (30 pmol) PKD1KD or PKD1KD S738/742E. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5.25 µL of D2O buffer (20 mM pH 7.5 HEPES, 100mM NaCl, 1 mM ATPγS, 5 mM MgCl2, 85.8% D2O (V/V)) to 0.75 µL of PKD1cat WT or mutant (final D2O concentration of 71.3%). The reaction proceeded for 3, 30, 300, or 3000s at 20°C, before being quenched with ice cold acidic quench buffer, resulting in a final concentration of 0.6M guanidine-HCl and 0.9% formic acid post quench. All conditions and timepoints were generated in triplicate. Protein samples were rapidly thawed and injected onto an integrated fluidics system containing a HDx-3 PAL liquid handling robot and climate-controlled (2°C) chromatography system (LEAP Technologies), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system, as well as an Impact HD QTOF Mass spectrometer (Bruker). The full details of the automated LC system are described in 64. The protein was run over one immobilized pepsin column (Trajan; ProDx protease column, 2.1 mm x 30 mm PDX.PP01-F32) at 200 µL/min for 3 minutes at 10°C. The resulting peptides were collected and desalted on a C18 trap column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7mm column (2.1 x 5 mm); Waters 186003975). The trap was subsequently eluted in line with an ACQUITY 1.7 μm particle, 100 × 1 mm2 C18 UPLC column (Waters), using a gradient of 3-35% B (Buffer A 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B 100% acetonitrile) over 11 minutes immediately followed by a gradient of 35-80% over 5 minutes. Mass spectrometry experiments acquired over a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z using an electrospray ionization source operated at a temperature of 200C and a spray voltage of 4.5 kV.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified from the non-deuterated samples of PKD1KD or PKD1KD S738/742E using data-dependent acquisition following tandem MS/MS experiments (0.5 s precursor scan from 150-2000 m/z; twelve 0.25 s fragment scans from 150-2000 m/z). MS/MS datasets were analyzed using PEAKS7 (PEAKS), and peptide identification was carried out by using a false discovery-based approach, with a threshold set to 1% using a database of known contaminants found in Sf9 cells 65. The search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass error 0.02 Da, charge states from 1-8, leading to a selection criterion of peptides that had a -10logP score of 26.2 and 24.8 for PKD1KD or PKD1KD S738/742E, respectively.HD-Examiner Software (Sierra Analytics) was used to calculate the level of deuterium incorporation into each peptide. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, and appropriate selection of isotopic distribution. Deuteration levels were calculated using the centroid of the experimental isotope clusters. Results are presented as relative levels of deuterium incorporation, with no correction for back exchange. The only correction was for the deuterium percentage of the buffer in the exchange reaction (71.3%). Differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria: ≥5% change in exchange, ≥0.5 Da difference in exchange, and a 2-tailed T-test value of less than 0.01.

### Publication Abstract
Phosphorylation is a ubiquitous mechanism by which signals are transduced in cells. Protein kinases, enzymes that catalyze the phosphotransfer reaction are, themselves, often regulated by phosphorylation. Paradoxically, however, a substantial fraction of more than 500 human protein kinases are capable of catalyzing their own activation loop phosphorylation. Commonly, these kinases perform this autophosphorylation reaction in <i>trans</i>, whereby transient dimerization leads to the mutual phosphorylation of the activation loop of the opposing protomer. In this study, we demonstrate that protein kinase D (PKD) is regulated by the inverse mechanism of dimerization-mediated <i>trans</i>-autoinhibition, followed by activation loop autophosphorylation in <i>cis</i>. We show that PKD forms a stable face-to-face homodimer that is incapable of either autophosphorylation or substrate phosphorylation. Dissociation of this <i>trans</i>-autoinhibited dimer results in activation loop autophosphorylation, which occurs exclusively in <i>cis</i>. Phosphorylation serves to increase PKD activity and prevent <i>trans</i>-autoinhibition, thereby switching PKD on. Our findings not only reveal the mechanism of PKD regulation but also have profound implications for the regulation of many other eukaryotic kinases.
