### Title
Comparison of Proteomic Responses

### Description
To facilitate antibiotic research, we have developed a compendium of proteomic responses that allows rapid classification of compounds into those with precedented and unprecedented modes of action. We gathered more than 100 proteomic response profiles of B. subtilis to treatment with antibiotics. To depict acute bacterial responses to sublethal doses of antibiotics, we used pulse-labeling of proteins that are newly synthesized after antibiotic challenge and analyze the proteome by 2D-PAGE. Subsequently, marker proteins were excised from non-radioactive gels and identified by mass spectrometry. Through compilation of response profiles, marker proteins are delineated as signatures, which are specific for inhibition of cellular processes like DNA, RNA, or protein biosynthesis, metabolic processes like fatty acid or folic acid biosynthesis, and attacks on cellular structures like the cytoplasmic membrane or the cell wall.

### Sample Protocol
Cells of B. subtilis were disrupted and cytosolic proteins separated via 2D-PAGE. Protein spots were excised from preparative 2D gels and subjected to tryptic in-gel digestion. Identification was performed on a nanoAcquitiyUPLC (Waters, Milford, USA) coupled to a Synapt G2-S high resolution mass spectrometer equipped with a lock spray source for electrospray ionization and a ToF detector (Waters). Peptides were loaded onto a trap column and separated on an analytical column (C18) using a H2O/acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% formic acid.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified using the ProteinLynxGlobalServer 2.5.2 software (Waters) with a non-redundant version of the B. subtilis 168 database (NCBI Bio Project accession PRJNA56675) with added sequences of trypsin and human keratin.
