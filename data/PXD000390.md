### Title
Systems analysis of Salmonella regulatory mutants

### Description
Sample-matched multi-omic measurements of fourteen virulence-essential regulator mutants were coupled with computational network analysis to efficiently identify Salmonella virulence factors.  A subset of computationally predicted virulence factors was determined to be secreted into the host cytoplasm, and two of these, SrfN and PagK2, were required for full mouse virulence and defined a new class of translocated effectors involved in pathogenesis.
