### Title
Toxoplasma gondii LC-MS/MS -  Unconventional endosome-like compartment and retromer complex in Toxoplasma gondii govern parasite integrity and host infection

### Description
The phylum Apicomplexa comprises an ancient group of early divergent eukaryotes, including some of the most deadly pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. Plasmodium species are responsible for malaria, which causes as many as 700,000 deaths per year, while Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects up to 30% of the human population, with immunocompromised patients and pregnant women at risk for adverse outcomes, such as toxoplasmic encephalitis and spontaneous abortion, respectively. T. gondii is considered a model system not only for its pathogenic relatives but also for intracellular parasitism and infection biology in general. T. gondii has common eukaryotic organelles, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a single Golgi stack, but also specific secretory organelles named dense granules, micronemes, and rhoptries that contain parasite-derived factors required for host infection. Rhoptries and micronemes are formed de novo during parasite replication, and this process requires significant protein and lipid trafficking through the secretory pathway. The trafficking mechanisms employed by T. gondii retain several typical eukaryote components as well as evolving divergent features. Protein trafficking of this parasite is mediated by entry into a canonical ER followed by vesicle packaging through a single Golgi complex. Post-Golgi protein sorting to specific organelles requires the function of dynamin-related protein B, which is involved in fission events. Downstream Rab-GTPases function throughout the parasite secretory pathway. T. gondii soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins in docking and fusion at target membranes have also been described. However, unlike in mammalian cells, T. gondii ER is reduced so that the nuclear envelope itself contributes to a substantial proportion of its total volume. Whereas in mammalian cells hundreds of Golgi stacks occupy the perinuclear area, the Golgi apparatus is limited to a single discrete structure in T.gondii. The post-Golgi system also named the endosome-like compartment (ELC) is involved in the trafficking of microneme proteins. The ELC is decorated by the small GTPases, Rab5 and Rab7, which are typically associated with the endosomal system. Nevertheless, classical endocytosis has not yet been validated in T. gondii. This parasite has no lysosomes; rather the parasite harbors acidic vesicles that were thought to be precursors of the rhoptry organelles. The parasite lacks most components of endosomal sorting complexes (ESCRT), which are known for their roles in forming multivesicular bodies that deliver ubiquitinated membrane proteins and lipids to lysosomes for degradation. The machinery required for caveogenesis and caveola-dependent invaginations have not yet been identified in the parasite. Furthermore, while evidence of conventional clathrin-dependent endocytosis by T.gondii is lacking, clathrin is present exclusively in post-Golgi compartments where its function is restricted to post-Golgi trafficking, and the uptake of cytosol proteins by the tachyzoites of T. gondii has recently been described using an endocytosis assay. However, the mechanisms underlying the events of this unconventional endocytosis in the parasite remain to be determined. Clearly, the secretory pathway of T. gondii can be considered a stripped-down version of the more complex trafficking machinery that characterizes higher eukaryotes. Despite this minimal trafficking machinery, the parasites actively rely on a membrane vesicle formation and transport during its intracellular lifecycle; however, to date, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in trafficking pathways in T. gondii. We previously reported a T. gondii sortilin-like receptor (TgSORTLR) that regulates protein transport and is essential for apical secretory organelle biogenesis and host infection17. Moreover, the C-terminal tail of TgSORTLR was shown to be involved in recruiting many cytosolic cargo proteins including two homologues of the core retromer components, Vps26 and Vps35, which are known to regulate retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) in yeast and mammals. Here, we report that a singular architecture with a trimer Vps35-Vps26-Vps29 core complex acts as the major cargo endosomal recycling machinery and is required for parasite integrity and more specifically for secretory organelle biogenesis and maintenance of a multiple ligand-binding transporter at the T. gondii membrane. Our findings provide strong evidence that the unconventional TgSORTLR-containing endosome-like compartment is involved in distinct mechanisms for the delivery of major retromer-dependent cargo. In this current work, we demonstrate a definitive role for the endocytic recycling pathway in T. gondii pathogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
T. gondii RH wild-type, RH(delta)ku80, and RH TaTi strains were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). Plaque size assays were performed using HFF cells infected with 250 parasites in the presence or absence of 1.5 μg/ml of ATc for 6 days followed by crystal violet staining. All stained coverslips were imaged with an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss). Tachyzoites (10^9 parasites) from TgVps35-HA, TgVps26-HA, TgVps29-cMyc, and RH(delta)ku80 strains were lysed with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 10 mM KCl; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.65 % NP40; 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF); and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich). After 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were then incubated with anti-HA or anti-cMyc agarose beads (Thermo Pierce) overnight at 4°C under rotating shaker. After five washings with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.2 % Triton X-100; 0.5 mM PMSF, and a final washing with 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, immunoprecipitates were eluted with Laemmli buffer (0.2 % SDS, 100 mM DTT, and 10 % sucrose). Proteins were electrophoresed onto 12% SDS-PAGE and stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gel bands were excised manually, reduced 1 h at 60°C by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM and alkylated by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 40 mM. An overnight digestion was performed by adding trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Tryptic peptides were extracted (60% ACN, 0.1% HCOOH) prior to mass spectrometry analyses. NanoLCMS/MS analyses were performed on three different systems: nano-ACQUITY Ultra-Performance-LC system (UPLC; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) hyphenated to either QTOF Impact HD or MaXis 4G (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and a nanoLCChip/Cube (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) hyphenated to an ion trap amaZon (Bruker Daltonics). For maXis 4G and amaZon analysis, methods used were previously described (Gissot, M., et al. J. Mol. Biol. 425, 1287-1301 (2013)) with slight differences. For Impact HD analysis, peptides were first trapped on a 0.18 mm X 20 mm, 5 μm Symmetry C18 pre-column (Waters), and then separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH130 C18 column (Waters), 75 μm x 250 mm with 1.7 μm particle size. The solvent system consisted of 0.1 % HCOOH in water (solvent A) and 0.1% HCOOH in ACN (solvent B). Trapping was performed for 3 min at 5 μL/min with 99% A and 1% B. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 450 nL/min, using a 1-35 % gradient (solvent B) over 30 min at 60 °C. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a Captive Spray source and a nano-Booster operating in positive mode, with the following settings: source temperature was set at 150 °C while drying gas flow was at 3 L/min. The nano-electrospray voltage was optimized to -1300 V. External mass calibration of the TOF was achieved before each set of analyses using Tuning Mix (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) in the mass range of 322–2722 m/z. Mass correction was achieved by recalibration of acquired spectra to the applied lock masses hexakis (2,2,3,3,-tetrafluoropropoxy) phosphazine ([M+H]+ = 922.0098 m/z)]. For tandem MS experiments (CID), the system was operated with fixed cycle time of 3s in the range of 150–2200 m/z. MS/MS scan speed was monitored in function of precursor intensity from 4 to 25 Hz. Ions were excluded after acquisition of one MS/MS spectra and the exclusion was released after 1 min. The complete system was fully controlled by Hystar 3.2 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

### Data Protocol
Mass data collected during nanoLC-MS/MS analyses were processed, converted into “.mgf” files with Data Analysis 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics) and interpreted using MASCOT 2.5.1 algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK) running on a local server. Searches were performed without any molecular weight or isoelectric point restrictions against an in-house generated protein database composed of protein sequences of T. gondii (ToxoDB database, October 2014) and known contaminant proteins such as human keratins and trypsin. All proteins were concatenated with reversed copies of all sequences (49,328 entries) with an in-house database generation toolbox https://msda.unistra.fr7. Trypsin was selected as enzyme, carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57 Da) was set as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine (+16 Da) were set as variable modification and both precursor and fragment mass tolerances were adapted according to instrumental mass accuracy. Mascot results were loaded into the Proline software (Proline Studio Release 1.0) and filtered in order to obtain a false discovery rate of less than 1%.

### Publication Abstract
Membrane trafficking pathways play critical roles in Apicomplexa, a phylum of protozoan parasites that cause life-threatening diseases worldwide. Here we report the first retromer-trafficking interactome in Toxoplasma gondii. This retromer complex includes a trimer Vps35-Vps26-Vps29 core complex that serves as a hub for the endosome-like compartment and parasite-specific proteins. Conditional ablation of TgVps35 reveals that the retromer complex is crucial for the biogenesis of secretory organelles and for maintaining parasite morphology. We identify TgHP12 as a parasite-specific and retromer-associated protein with functions unrelated to secretory organelle formation. Furthermore, the major facilitator superfamily homologue named TgHP03, which is a multiple spanning and ligand transmembrane transporter, is maintained at the parasite membrane by retromer-mediated endocytic recycling. Thus, our findings highlight that both evolutionarily conserved and unconventional proteins act in concert in T. gondii by controlling retrograde transport that is essential for parasite integrity and host infection.
