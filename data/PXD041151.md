### Title
Detection of N‑glycoprotein associated with IgA nephropathy in urine as a potential diagnostic biomarker using glycosylated proteomic analysis

### Description
The present study aimed to clarify the potential diagnosis value of the urinary N-glycoproteins using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN).

### Sample Protocol
In total, 3 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN were enrolled as an IgAN group and 3 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were also recruited as a healthy control group. All procedures were performed in Guang'an People's Hospital in China during June 2021 to August 2022. Fresh morning void midstream urine samples were collected in all participants.

### Data Protocol
Base on the filtration of P-value<0.05 and |log fold-change (FC)|>2 by the comparison between IgAN and healthy control groups, a total of 37 glycoproteins were up-regulated in IgAN patients, as well as 132 glycoproteins were down-regulated.
