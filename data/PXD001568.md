### Title
Bacillus cereus proteomics -  Deciphering the interactions between the Bacillus cereus linear plasmid, pBClin15, and its host by high-throughput comparative proteomics

### Description
This project contributes to the comparison of the exoproteome dynamics of Bacillus cereus wild-type grown in three OxidoRedductionPotential conditions and harvested at three growth stages.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE, sliced into polyacrylamide bands, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LTQ-Orbitrap XL tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
