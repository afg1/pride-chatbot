### Title
Proteomics and gene expression analysis of Nicotiana tabacum nectar proteins

### Description
Floral nectar proteins (nectarins) are mainly enzymes and play important roles in inhibiting microbial growth in nectar and tailoring nectar chemistry before or after secretory. Nectar proteomes are usually small, but only very few plant species have had their nectar proteomes thoroughly investigated. Nectarins from Nicotiana tabacum (NT) were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and then analyzed using mass spectrometry. Glycoproteins were isolated from raw NT nectar, separated by SDS-PAGE, and identified by mass spectrometry. All eight identified nectarins and four invertase genes’ expression were analysed by qPCR. Sugars composition, total sugar concentration, protein content, polyphenol content and hydrogen peroxide content were compared at different time intervals in extracted nectar and nectar in situ after secretion. Totally, eight nectarins were detected in NT nectar in which only two are glycoproteins, beta-xylosidase and a protein with unknown function. All of the eight nectarin genes expression was not nectary-specific and not synchronous along with the nectary development. After secretion, NT nectar in flower tube changed from sucrose–rich to hexose-rich type even though no free invertase or its activity was detected in NT nectar. No sugar composition changes observed in extracted nectar after incubating at 30 ℃ up to 48 hours in plastic tubes. Our results indicate that nectar post-secretory changes could be a complex process and tissue closely contact with nectar might function in it.

### Sample Protocol
Raw nectar was collected from common tobacco flowers from February to April in 2018. Pooled nectar was filtered through 0.22 µm syringe filters (Millipore) to remove dirt and pollen granules from the samples, and stored at -80℃ prior to use. Tobacco nectar was concentrated by 40 times by ultracentrifuge using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (10-kD cutoff; EMD Millipore) before used for 2-DE. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) was carried out using a PROTEAN i12 IEF system (Bio-Rad) and a 7-cm Immobiline Dry Strips (linear pH 3–10, Bio-Rad). Second-dimension electrophoresis was carried out on 12 % polyacrylamide gels in a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra system (Bio-rad) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The 2-DE gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. For protein identification, spots of interest were manually excised from 2-DE gels and subjected to in-gel digestion using trypsin as the protease, followed by protein identification using a 5800 tandem matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

### Data Protocol
The combined mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS) peak lists were analysed using GPS (Global Proteome Server) Explorer Software 3.6 (Applied Biosystems) with a Mascot search engine (MASCOT version 2.3; Matrix Science, London, UK), and searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBIprot 20170530). The taxonomic restrictions were set to NCBI- green plants.

### Publication Abstract
The tobacco nectar proteome mainly consists of pathogenesis-related proteins with two glycoproteins. Expression of nectarins was non-synchronous, and not nectary specific. After secretion, tobacco nectar changed from sucrose rich to hexose rich. Floral nectar proteins (nectarins) play important roles in inhibiting microbial growth in nectar, and probably also tailoring nectar chemistry before or after secretion; however, very few plant species have had their nectar proteomes thoroughly investigated. Nectarins from Nicotiana tabacum (NT) were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and then analysed using mass spectrometry. Seven nectarins were identified: acidic endochitinase, &#x3b2;-xylosidase, &#x3b1;-galactosidase, &#x3b1;-amylase, G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, pathogenesis-related protein 5, and early nodulin-like protein 2. An eighth nectarin, a glycoprotein with unknown function, was identified following isolation from NT nectar using a Qproteome total glycoprotein kit, separation by SDS-PAGE, and identification by mass spectrometry. Expression of all identified nectarins, plus four invertase genes, was analysed by qRT PCR; none of these genes had nectary-specific expression, and none had synchronous expression. The total content of sucrose, hexoses, proteins, phenolics, and hydrogen peroxide were determined at different time intervals in secreted nectar, both within the nectar tube (in vivo) and following extraction from it during incubation at 30&#xa0;&#xb0;C for up to 40&#xa0;h in plastic tubes (in vitro). After secretion, the ratio of hexose to sucrose substantially increased for in vivo nectar, but no sugar composition changes were detected in vitro. This implies that sucrose hydrolysis in vivo might be done by fixed apoplastic invertase. Both protein and hydrogen peroxide levels declined in vitro but not in vivo, implying that some factors other than nectarins act to maintain their levels in the flower, after secretion.
