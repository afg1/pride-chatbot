### Title
IgG purification- MS analysis - MS analysis was undertaken on human IgG purified using different approaches to assess purifity and potential alterations within the IgG N-linked glycans

### Description
MS analysis was undertaken on human IgG purified using different approaches to assess purifity and potential alterations within the IgG N-linked glycans

### Sample Protocol
Samples boiled in SDS, reduced with DTT (10mM), akylated with IAA (25mM) and then cleaned upusing SP3. Samples were digested overnight with trypsin and then cleaned up using home made C18 columns. Samples were run on a Orbitrap Elite (proteomic analysis) and Fusion Lumos (glycopeptide analysis).

### Data Protocol
Proteomic analysis was undertaken using Maxquant 1.5.3.30. Data was search agaisnt the Human Uniprot Proteome database. For glycopeptide analysis datafiles were searched with Byonic version3.4 against the Human proteome with allowing for N-linked glycosylation with the inbuilt human N-glycan databaset (containing 182 human glycan with no multiple fucose)
