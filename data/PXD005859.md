### Title
Glycoproteomics of Flagellin C9LY14 from Selenomonas sputigena

### Description
The Gram-negative, flagellated, anaerobic, crescent-shaped bacterium Selenomonas sputigena is a potential human periodontal pathogen. Information on its virulence factors and underlying pathogenicity mechanisms is scarce. Here we show for the first time that S. sputigena produces a diversely and heavily O-glycosylated flagellin C9LY14 as a major cellular protein, which carries various hitherto undescribed rhamnose- and N acetylglucosamine-linked O-glycans in the range from mono- to hexasaccharides. A comprehensive glycomic and glycoproteomic assessment revealed extensive glycan macro- and microheterogeneity on 20 unique glycopeptide species. From the multiple sites of glycosylation, five were unambiguously identified on the 437-amino acid C9LY14 protein (Thr149, Ser182, Thr199, Thr259, and Ser334). The O-glycans additionally showed modifications by methylation and acetylation. This is the first report on O-linked flagellin glycosylation in S. sputigena, revealing that C9LY14 is one of the most heavily glycosylated flagellins described to date.

### Sample Protocol
Native flagellin from bacterial cultures was enriched via differential centrifugation. After separation of the enriched preparation by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the protein band of interest was excised, destained, reduced, and carbamidomethylated. The protein was in-gel digested with Trypsin and the extracted peptides were subjected to a standard proteomics LC-MSMS analysis to identify the flagellin protein by Mascot MS/MS Ion Search against a database of all protein sequences from Selenomonas sputigena (UniProt). Subsequently the LC-MSMS analysis was repeated with different settings (ETD fragmentation) to investigate on the glycosylation of the peptides. Additionally the protein was also digested with Chymotrypsin and a sequential combination of Trypsin and Chymotrypsin. To further support the findings of protein glycosylation, monosaccharide analyses as well as glycomics analyses were carried out. For details please see the article.

### Data Protocol
The acquired LC-MSMS data was analyzed using Bruker DataAnalysis 4.2 and Bruker ProteinScape 3.1 with Matrix Science Mascot Server 2.3. A custom database of 3308 Selenomonas sputigena proteins was retrieved from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=selenomonas+sputigena) on June 10, 2014. This database was employed for the Mascot protein search. Glycopeptides were identified manually from the CID and ETD fragment spectra. The ExPASy tool Ã¢â‚¬Å“PepSweetenerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (http://glycoproteome.expasy.org/pepsweetener/app/) assisted in the initial identification of the peptide and glycan moieties of the glycopeptides based on precursor masses. The online tool Fragment Ion Calculator (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, USA; http://db.systemsbiology.net:8080/proteomicsToolkit/FragIonServlet.html) was further used to verify the detected fragment spectra.

### Publication Abstract
Flagellated, Gram-negative, anaerobic, crescent-shaped <i>Selenomonas</i> species are colonizers of the digestive system, where they act at the interface between health and disease. <i>Selenomonas sputigena</i> is also considered a potential human periodontal pathogen, but information on its virulence factors and underlying pathogenicity mechanisms is scarce. Here we provide the first report of a <i>Selenomonas</i> glycoprotein, showing that <i>S. sputigena</i> produces a diversely and heavily <i>O</i>-glycosylated flagellin C9LY14 as a major cellular protein, which carries various hitherto undescribed rhamnose- and <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine linked <i>O</i>-glycans in the range from mono- to hexasaccharides. A comprehensive glycomic and glycoproteomic assessment revealed extensive glycan macro- and microheterogeneity identified from 22 unique glycopeptide species. From the multiple sites of glycosylation, five were unambiguously identified on the 437-amino acid C9LY14 protein (Thr149, Ser182, Thr199, Thr259, and Ser334), the only flagellin protein identified. The <i>O</i>-glycans additionally showed modifications by methylation and putative acetylation. Some <i>O</i>-glycans carried hitherto undescribed residues/modifications as determined by their respective <i>m/z</i> values, reflecting the high diversity of native <i>S. sputigena</i> flagellin. We also found that monosaccharide rearrangement occurred during collision-induced dissociation (CID) of protonated glycopeptide ions. This effect resulted in pseudo Y1-glycopeptide fragment ions that indicated the presence of additional glycosylation sites on a single glycopeptide. CID oxonium ions and electron transfer dissociation, however, confirmed that just a single site was glycosylated, showing that glycan-to-peptide rearrangement can occur on glycopeptides and that this effect is influenced by the molecular nature of the glycan moiety. This effect was most pronounced with disaccharides. This study is the first report on <i>O</i>-linked flagellin glycosylation in a <i>Selenomonas</i> species, revealing that C9LY14 is one of the most heavily glycosylated flagellins described to date. This study contributes to our understanding of the largely under-investigated surface properties of oral bacteria. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005859.
