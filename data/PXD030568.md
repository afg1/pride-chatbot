### Title
Homeostatic sleep regulation by microglial TNFalpha - a phosphoproteome study

### Description
To explore the role of microglial TNFα in the control of sleep through phosphorylation. Specifically, to examine the involvement of microglial TNFα in the control of brain phosphorylation along the sleep-wake cycle and in the phosphorylation-based coding of sleep need.

### Sample Protocol
CX3CR1GFP/+:TNFf/f (transgenic controls, CTL) and CX3CR1CreERT2/+:TNFf/f (microglia-TNFα depleted mice, micTNF-KO) mice were fed with tamoxifen-containing food (1000mg tamoxifen citrate in 1 kg of chow, formulated by SSNIFF, A115-T71000) for 6 days. Experiments were performed 5 to 6 weeks after tamoxifen feeding. Mice at ZT6 (sleep period), ZT18 (wake period) and after sleep deprivation (SD) and recovery sleep were analyzed. At the indicated time points, mice (5 per group for each genotype) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, their brains rapidly dissected and rinsed in ice-cold PBS, the frontal cortex collected into an ice-cold tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80ºC until further processing (all samples were prepared at the same time).  Frozen cortex tissues were lysed in freshly-prepared 200 μl of urea lysis buffer [8 M urea, 50 Mm NH4HCO3 supplemented with protease (Roche, 05056489001) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04906837001)] at room temperature by mechanical dissociation with pipette. Cortex lysates were sonicated on ice to avoid heating and centrifuged at 17000g for 10min at 4ºC. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, 23225). 250µg of each cell lysate were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 °C and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were then diluted in 200mM ammonium bicarbonate to reach a final concentration of 1 M urea, and digested overnight at 37 °C with Trypsin/Lys-C (Promega, V5071) at a ratio of 1/50. Digested peptide lysates were acidified with formic acid to a final concentration of 5% formic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm and loaded onto homemade SepPak C18 Tips for desalting. Peptides were eluted and 90% of the starting material was enriched using TitansphereTM Phos-TiO kit centrifuge columns (GL Sciences, 5010-21312) as described by the manufacturer. After elution from the Spin tips, the phospho-peptides and the remaining 10% eluted peptides were vacuum concentrated to dryness and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS phosphoproteome and proteome analyses.

### Data Protocol
For identification, the data were searched against the Mus Musculus UP000000589 database (downloaded 03/2020) using Sequest HT through Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, N-terminal acetylation, methionine loss and methionine acetylation loss were set as variable modifications. Phospho serine, threonine and tyrosines were also set as variable modifications in phosphoproteome analyses. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0.02 Da for MS/MS peaks. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS [PMID: 17610305; https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms] v.3.9.3. False-discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator [PMID: 27572102] and was set to 1% at the peptide level for the whole study. Label-free quantification was performed using peptide extracted ion chromatograms (XICs), computed with MassChroQ [PMID: 21751374] v.2.2.1. For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching for proteome setting and simple ratios for phosphoproteome) with missed cleavages were used. Median and scale normalization at peptide level was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (N=5). The phosphosite localization accuracy was estimated by using the PtmRS node in PD, in PhosphoRS mode only. Phosphosites with a localization site probability greater than 75% were quantified at the peptide level. To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR procedure.

### Publication Abstract
Sleep intensity is adjusted by the length of previous awake time, and under tight homeostatic control by protein phosphorylation. Here, we establish microglia as a new cellular component of the sleep homeostasis circuit. Using quantitative phosphoproteomics of the mouse frontal cortex, we demonstrate that microglia-specific deletion of TNF&#x3b1; perturbs thousands of phosphorylation sites during the sleep period. Substrates of microglial TNF&#x3b1; comprise sleep-related kinases such as MAPKs and MARKs, and numerous synaptic proteins, including a subset whose phosphorylation status encodes sleep need and determines sleep duration. As a result, microglial TNF&#x3b1; loss attenuates the build-up of sleep need, as measured by electroencephalogram slow-wave activity and prevents immediate compensation for loss of sleep. Our data suggest that microglia control sleep homeostasis by releasing TNF&#x3b1; which acts on neuronal circuitry through dynamic control of phosphorylation.
