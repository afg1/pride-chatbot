### Title
13C15N – Glucagon-based novel isotope dilution mass spectrometry method for measurement of glucagon metabolism in humans

### Description
Glucagon serves as an important regulatory hormone for regulating blood glucose concentrations with tight feedback control with insulin and glucose. There are critical gaps in our understanding of glucagon kinetics, pancreatic α cell function and intra-islet feedback network that are disrupted in type 1 diabetes. This is important for translational research applications of evolving dual-hormone (insulin+glucagon) closed-loop artificial pancreas algorithms and their usage in type 1 diabetes. Thus, it is important to accurately measure glucagon kinetics in vivo and to develop robust models of glucose-insulin-glucagon interplay that could inform next generation of artificial pancreas algorithms.

### Sample Protocol
Here, we describe the utilization of novel 13C15N heavy isotopes of glucagon tracers followed by anti-glucagon antibody-based enrichment and LC-MS/MS based-targeted assays using high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine levels of infused glucagon in plasma samples. The optimized assay results were applied for measurement of glucagon turnover in subjects with and without type 1 diabetes infused with isotopically heavy glucagon tracers.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed in Xcalibur Quan Browser (Thermo) for determination of response curves and quantitation of endogenous and isotopically heavy tracers of glucagon in plasma samples.
