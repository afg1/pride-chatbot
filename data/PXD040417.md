### Title
Mode-of-Action Studies using  PfHsp90-Binding Molecules with Anti-Malarial Activity

### Description
Two PfHsp90-binding molecules, BX2819 and HS292  that have and do not have (respectively) biological activity against the blood and liver stages of Plasmodium Falciparum, were subjected to a Thermal Proteome Profiling analysis to identify the direct and indirect protein target of these molecules.

### Sample Protocol
The proteins in a plasmodium lysate were subjected to a series of 10 different temperatures both in the absence and in the presence of each PfHsp90-binding molecule, the unfolded proteins at each temperature were precipitated out of solution, and the soluble proteins remaining in solution were subject to a quantitative bottom-up proteomics analysis using an iFASP protocol and a TMT-10-plex to read out the temperature-dependent unfolding/precipitation behavior of the lysate proteins under each condition (i.e., in the absence and  in the presence of each PfHsp90-binding molecule).  The TMT-labeled samples at each condition were combined, the sample from each condition were separated into 8 fractions using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit, and in each case the 8 fractions were analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was searched using Thermo Proteome Discoverer. After quality filtering, the data were normalized and fit to specific equations as described in the publication. Proteins with ligand-induced changes in their thermal stability were selected based on how different the control and ligand groups were from each other as described in the publication.
