### Title
LC-MS/MS analysis on in-vivo mice gastrointestinal digests

### Description
Food protein amyloid fibrils have superior technological,nutritional,sensorial,and physical properties compared to native monomers, butthere is yet insufficient understanding of their digestive fate and safety for wide consumption.By combining SDS,ELISA,fluorenscence,AFM, MALDI-MS, CD microfluidics,and SAXS techniques for the characterization of blg and lysozyme amyloid fibrils subjected to in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion.LC-MS/MS analysis on the fate of blg/lysozyme amyloid fibrils digested in vivo by mice was applied to verify our in vitro results.

### Sample Protocol
The in-vivo digested products of blg/lysozyme amyloid fibrils and monomer and their peptides indentification in small intestinal tracts,colon and serum were studied by LC-MS/MS. Six-week-old Kunming male mice(n=6 per group)were starved for 24 h, after which they were orally gavaged with 200uL 1 mg/ml of blg/lysozyme amyloid fibrils and monomer solutions,separately. The contents of each small intestinal tracts and colon were collected after 4 h gastrointestinal digestion for digests identification. For serum peptides identification,mice were orally gavaged with 200 uL 1 mg/ml blg/lysozyme amyloid fibrils and monomer solution,serum sample were collected after 1 h digestion.LC/MS/MS measurements were performed on a Q ExactiveTM mass spectrometer coupled to Easy nLC(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Specifically, 15 uL of each sample was injected from the autosampler to Zorbax 300SB-C18 peptide traps(Agilent Technologies, Wilmington,DE),and then separated by liquid chromatography column(15 cm,75 um I.D., 5 um resin, C18 reversed phase column)which was equilibrated by buffer A (0.1% formic acid solution) and then separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile)at a flow rate of 250 nL/min controlled by INtelliFlow technology over 120 min.

### Data Protocol
MS data was acquired using a data-dependent top10 method which dynamiclly chose the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (300-1,800m/z) for high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD)fragmentation. The target value was determined based on predictive automatic gain control(AGC) and the dynamic exclusion duration was 20s. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 and resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 at m/z at m/z 200. Normalized collision energy of 27 eV was used while the underfill ration,which specifiles the minimum percentage of target value likely to be reached at maximum fill time, was set at 0.1% peptide recognition mode was enabled throughout the run. MS data were processed using the MaxQuant software by Uniprot database without specifying enzyme cleavage rules for the processed MGF files.Label-free peptide quantification (LFQ) based on extracted ion chromatograms and validation were performed in the MaxQuant software.

### Publication Abstract
Food protein amyloid fibrils have superior technological, nutritional, sensorial, and physical properties compared to native monomers, but there is as yet insufficient understanding of their digestive fate and safety for wide consumption. By combining SDS-PAGE, ELISA, fluorescence, AFM, MALDI-MS, CD, microfluidics, and SAXS techniques for the characterization of &#x3b2;-lactoglobulin and lysozyme amyloid fibrils subjected to in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion, here we show that either no noticeable conformational differences exist between amyloid aggregates and their monomer counterparts after the gastrointestinal digestion process (as in &#x3b2;-lactoglobulin), or that amyloid fibrils are digested significantly better than monomers (as in lysozyme). Moreover, in-vitro exposure of human cell lines and in-vivo studies with C. elegans and mouse models, indicate that the digested fibrils present no observable cytotoxicity, physiological abnormalities in health-span, nor accumulation of fibril-induced plaques in brain nor other organs. These extensive in-vitro and in-vivo studies together suggest that the digested food amyloids are at least equally as safe as those obtained from the digestion of corresponding native monomers, pointing to food amyloid fibrils as potential ingredients for human nutrition.
