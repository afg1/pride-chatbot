### Title
The challenge of identifying tuberculosis proteins in archaeological tissues

### Description
Following the report of Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins derived from archaeological bone by Boros-Major et al. (2011), we attempted to recover M. tuberculosis proteins in mummified lung tissues from which aDNA success had already been reported. Using a filter-aided sample preparation protocol modified for ancient samples we applied shotgun proteomics to seven samples of mummified lung, chest and pleura tissues. However, we only identified four peptides with unique matches to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, none of which were unique to M. tuberculosis, although we did identify a range of human proteins and non-mycobacterial bacterial proteins. In light of these limited results, we question the validity of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) approach presented by Boros-Major et al. (2011), especially due to its similarity to that of human collagen, the dominant protein in the tissue under investigation. We explore the challenges of using proteomic approaches to detect M. tuberculosis, and propose that, given the contentious outcomes that have plagued ancient protein research in the past, the susceptibility of ancient material to modern contamination, and the degradation inherent in archaeological materials, caution is needed in the acquisition, analysis and reporting of proteomic data from such material.

### Sample Protocol
Seven samples of 18th-19th century mummified lung tissue were selected. Approximately 20 mg of mummified tissue was pulverised using a sterile mortar and pestle. 100µl of SDS lysis buffer (comprised of 6M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1M dithiothreitol, 4% SDS)  was added to all samples, which were heated in boiling water for 5 minutes. We then applied a filter-aided sample preparation digestion approach modified for ancient samples (Wiśniewski et al. 2009; Cappellini et al. 2012; Warinner, Rodrigues, et al. 2014). The resulting tryptic peptides were separated with a nano-Acquity UPLC system, followed by analysis with a maXis 3G (UHR-Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), as described previously (Warinner, Rodrigues, et al. 2014).

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were converted to searchable Mascot generic format using Proteowizard version 3.0.6839 using the 200 most intense peaks in each MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS ions were searched using Mascot version 2.5.1 against both UniProt (2014) and a database comprised of human sequences and M. tuberculosis. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance at 0.1 Da. Based on previous observations for ancient proteins (Cappellini et al. 2012), variable modifications modifications included carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification (due to treatment with iocoacetamide), and acetyl (protein N-terminus), deamidation (NQ), glutamine to pyroglutamate, methionine oxidation and hydroxylation of proline as variable modifications. Mascot results were filtered using a significance threshold of p < 0.05 and an ion score cut off of 25.
