### Title
The atrial and ventricular myocardial proteome of end-stage lamin heart disease

### Description
Background: Lamins A/C (encoded by the LMNA gene) can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).   Objectives: This study sought to undertake proteomic analysis of myocardial tissue to explore the postgenomic phenotype of end-stage lamin heart disease.   Methods: Consecutive patients with end-stage lamin heart disease (LMNA-group, n=7) and ischaemic DCM (ICM-group, n=7) undergoing heart transplantation were enrolled. Samples were obtained from left atrium(LA), left ventricle(LV), right atrium(RA), right ventricle(RV) and interventricular septum(IVS). Liquid chromatography combined with mass-spectrometry was used for protein quantification. We compared protein concentrations in cardiac samples between LMNA and ICM groups. Proteins were considered differentially abundant if the quantitative difference was 1.5-fold and corrected p-value <0.05 at a false discovery rate of 0.01. Gene ontology(GO) enrichment analysis explored the related biological processes.   Results: 4,247 proteins were identified in LMNA and ICM samples, of which 633 were differentially abundant in LA, 39 in LV, 181 in RA, 52 in RV, and 85 in IVS. Abundance of lamin A/C was reduced but lamin B (LMNB) increased in LMNA LA/RA tissue compared to ICM, but not in LV/RV. Transthyretin was more abundant in the LV/RV of LMNA compared to ICM while sarcomeric proteins such as titin and cardiac myosin heavy chain were generally reduced in RA/LA of LMNA. Protein expression profiling and GO enrichment analysis revealed sarcopenia, extracellular matrix(ECM) remodeling, deficient myocardial energetics, redox imbalances, and abnormal calcium handling in LMNA samples.   Conclusion: Lamin heart disease is a biventricular and biatrial disease, characterized by sarcopenia, aberrant metabolism, and ECM remodeling. LMNB and transthyretin were unexpectedly abundant in the atria and ventricles respectively of patients with end-stage lamin heart disease potentially hinting to the possibility of compensatory responses.

### Sample Protocol
Sample harvesting  Myocardial specimens (each of length Ã¢â€°Â¥2cm) were harvested fresh, immediately after cardiac explantation. Each excised tissue sample was placed in a separate container to avoid cross-contamination of sample material, and the container was then immediately submerged into liquid nitrogen thus flash freezing the sample which was subsequently stored in the -80oC freezer. Samples were shipped to the proteomics laboratory on dry ice at -80oC without any intervening freeze thaw cycles  Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were high purity grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, Missouri, US). Specimens were prepared using the Biognosys (Schlieren, Switzerland) optimized protocol which was previously described.   Firstly, specimens were lysed using Biognosys Denature Buffer. Then, proteins were reduced and alkylated in the dark using Biognosys Reduction and Alkylation solution for 1 hour at 37oC. Processed proteins were digested overnight to peptides at 37oC with trypsin (Promega, Madison Wisconsin, US) using a 1:50 protease to total protein ratio per sample.  Peptides were desalted using an octadecyl carbon chain (C18) MicroSpin plate (The Nest Group, Ipswich, Massachusetts, US) and a SpeedVac system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, US). Peptides were suspended in 1% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (solution A), and spiked with Biognosys iRT calibration kit. Peptide concentrations were determined using the ultraviolet visible (UV/VIS) spectrometer SPECTROstar Nano (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK). Then, peptides were pooled according to the group (i.e., LMNA and ICM), and ammonium hydroxide added to the pools until a pH>10 was reached to alkalinize the samples.  Preparation of the CTRL samples (from the IVS of healthy donor hearts not used for cardiac transplantation) and their analysis using a nanoAcquity high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) and QTOF Premier mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, U.K.) with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been previously reported.  Peptide purification using high-pH reversed-phase chromatography  For LMNA and ICM samples, a high-pH reversed-phase chromatography (HPRP) using a C18-bonded silica column was employed for the purification of peptides with methodology previous described6. HRCP was performed at a flow of 0.8 ml/min in 20 minutes using a linear gradient of 1% to 40% acetonitrile (solution B) gradient in an ensemble of a DionexTM UltiMateTM 3000 pump (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, US) coupled with an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 Column (Waters PLC, Manchester UK). Fractions were collected every 30 seconds, pooled into 5 fractions, left to dry, resuspended in solution A, and normalized using the BiognosysÃ‚Â® iRT calibiration kit. Peptide concentrations were determined using the UV/VIS spectrometry as above.

### Data Protocol
We compared the concentration of proteins in LA, LV, RA, RV and IVS between the LMNA and ICM groups, while qualitative comparisons (presence/absence of candidate proteins) were made against CTRL samples due to the different MS protocols used. A protein differently abundant is referred to as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“candidateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The following thresholds were applied for candidate identification: (1) absolute average log 2 ratio > 0.58 (equivalent to a 1.5x fold increase), and (2) q-value<0.05.  Since a higher q-value means that the protein would pass a more restrictive FDR cut-off, differentially abundant proteins were ranked based on q-value.  Since the principal components (PCs) are solutions of the cluster membership indicators for k-means14, PC analysis (PCA) was performed to visualize dataset variation, and to provide separation of tissue provenance (i.e., LA, LV, RA, RV and IVS) and sample group (i.e., LMNA and ICM). With the same aim, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed as part of this proteome-wide exploratory data analysis step. Given the multidimensional nature of the protein intensities across multiple samples grouped by heart cavity and group, Manhattan rather than Euclidian distance was plotted in the HCA. In order to interpret our findings and generate biologically plausible hypotheses, a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed in the Spectronaut software using a gene association file provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Biological processes, cellular components and molecular function GO categories with >2 members were considered.

### Publication Abstract
Lamins A/C (encoded by <i>LMNA</i> gene) can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This pilot study sought to explore the postgenomic phenotype of end-stage lamin heart disease. Consecutive patients with end-stage lamin heart disease (LMNA-group, n = 7) and ischaemic DCM (ICM-group, n = 7) undergoing heart transplantation were prospectively enrolled. Samples were obtained from left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV) and interventricular septum (IVS), avoiding the infarcted myocardial segments in the ICM-group. Samples were analysed using a discovery 'shotgun' proteomics approach. We found that 990 proteins were differentially abundant between LMNA and ICM samples with the LA being most perturbed (16-fold more than the LV). Abundance of lamin A/C protein was reduced, but lamin B increased in LMNA LA/RA tissue compared to ICM, but not in LV/RV. Carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA3) was over-abundant across all LMNA tissue samples (LA, LV, RA, RV, and IVS) when compared to ICM. Transthyretin was more abundant in the LV/RV of LMNA compared to ICM, while sarcomeric proteins such as titin and cardiac alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain were generally less abundant in RA/LA of LMNA. Protein expression profiling and enrichment analysis pointed towards sarcopenia, extracellular matrix remodeling, deficient myocardial energetics, redox imbalances, and abnormal calcium handling in LMNA samples. Compared to ICM, end-stage lamin heart disease is a biventricular but especially a biatrial disease appearing to have an abundance of lamin B, CA3 and transthyretin, potentially hinting to compensatory responses.
