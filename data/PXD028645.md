### Title
The influence of high salt on IFN-I-induced antiviral proteins

### Description
High salt diets have recently been implicated in hypertension, cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disease. However, whether and how dietary salt affects host antiviral response remain elusive. Here, we report that high salt induces an instant reduction in host antiviral immunity, although this effect is compromised during a long-term high salt diet.

### Sample Protocol
RAW264.7 cells were treated with mIFNÎ² (500 IU/ml) for 12 hrs immediately after addition of NaCl (+34 mM), and whole cell lysates were subjected to a quantitative proteomic analysis with a TMT2-plex method to identify the differentially expressed proteins.

### Data Protocol
A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans with 15.0s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4. Fixed first mass was set as 100 m/z. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy database.
