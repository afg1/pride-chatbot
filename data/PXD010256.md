### Title
Modulation of glioma cell proteome by Delta-24-RGD adenovirus (48hpi)

### Description
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of malignant glioma. Oncolytic adenoviruses are being modified to exploit the aberrant expression of proteins in tumor cells to enhance tumor tropism and glioma-selective replication. E1A mutant adenovirus Delta-24-RGD has shown favorable toxicity profile and remarkable efficacy in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial. However, the comprehensive modulation of glioma metabolism in response to Delta-24-RGD infection is poorly understood. Integrating mass spectrometry based-quantitative proteomics, physical and functional interaction data, and biochemical approaches, we conducted a cell-wide study of intracellular and secreted glioma proteomes at late stage of Delta-24-RGD infection, when prominent autophagy has been described.

### Sample Protocol
Cellular extracts from Mock-infected, and U87-48h-infected cells were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 1mm thick polyacrylamide gel in a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. The run was stopped as soon as the front entered 3 mm into the resolving gel so that the whole proteome became concentrated in the stacking/resolving gel interface. Bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and excised from the gel. Protein enzymatic cleavage (20ug) was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37°C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko, A. et al., In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes. Nat Protoc 1 (6), 2856 (2006)). Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore).

### Data Protocol
The peptide quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC−MS software (ver. 2.0.5556.29015, Nonlinear Dynamics). Using the accurate mass measurements from full survey scans in the TOF detector and the observed retention times, runs were aligned to compensate for between-run variations in our nanoLC separation system. To this end, all runs were aligned to a reference run automatically chosen by the software, and a master list of features considering m/z values and retention times was generated. The quality of these alignments was manually supervised with the help of quality scores provided by the software. The peptide identifications were exported from Protein Pilot software and imported in Progenesis LC− MS software where they were matched to the respective features. Output data files were managed for subsequent statistical analyses and representation. Proteins identified by site (identification based only on a modification), reverse proteins (identified by decoy database) and potential contaminants were filtered out. Proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides, an ANOVA p-value lower than 0.05, and an absolute fold change of <0.77 (down-regulation) or >1.3 (up-regulation) in linear scale were considered significantly differentially expressed.

### Publication Abstract
Adenovirus Delta-24-RGD has shown a remarkable efficacy in a phase I clinical trial for glioblastoma. Delta-24-RGD induces autophagy in glioma cells, however, the molecular derangements associated with Delta-24-RGD infection remains poorly understood. Here, proteomics was applied to characterize the glioma metabolic disturbances soon after Delta-24-RGD internalization and late in infection. Minutes post-infection, a rapid survival reprogramming of glioma cells was evidenced by an early c-Jun activation and a time-dependent dephosphorylation of multiple survival kinases. At 48&#x202f;h post-infection (hpi), a severe intracellular proteostasis impairment was characterized, detecting differentially expressed proteins related to mRNA splicing, cytoskeletal organization, oxidative response, and inflammation. Specific kinase-regulated protein interactomes for Delta-24-RGD-modulated proteome revealed interferences with the activation dynamics of protein kinases C and A (PKC, PKA), tyrosine-protein kinase Src (c-Src), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as well as serine/threonine-protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1, PP2A) at 48hpi, in parallel with adenoviral protein overproduction. Moreover, the late activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B) correlates with the extracellular increment of specific cytokines involved in migration, and activation of different inflammatory cells. Taken together, our integrative analysis provides further insights into the effects triggered by Delta-24-RGD in the modulation of tumor suppression and immune response against glioma. SIGNIFICANCE: The current study provides new insights regarding the molecular mechanisms governing the glioma metabolism during Delta-24-RGD oncolytic adenoviral therapy. The compilation and analysis of intracellular and extracellular proteomics have led us to characterize: i) the cell survival reprogramming during Delta-24-RGD internalization, ii) the proteostatic disarrangement induced by Delta-24-RGD during the autophagic stage, iii) the protein interactomes for Delta-24-RGD-modulated proteome, iv) the regulatory effects on kinase dynamics induced by Delta-24-RGD late in infection, and v) the overproduction of multitasking cytokines upon Delta-24-RGD treatment. We consider that the quantitative molecular maps generated in this study may establish the foundations for the development of complementary adenoviral based-vectors to increase the potency against glioma.
