### Title
Metaproteomic analysis of biofilms sampled from a pool of a nuclear facility

### Description
Metaproteomic analysis of four samples of biofilm from the walls of a pool used to store radioactive materials. Without any a priori metaproteomics interpretation allowed identification of the proteins and their taxonomical origins, and differential functional characterization between the two main microorganisms was performed using Gene Ontology GOslim terms.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were extracted by bead-beating, loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, treated with chemical reagents for fixing the cysteine modification, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by means of a Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent analysis mode.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT. The results were then parsed and spectral counts were extracted.
