### Title
Validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics assay for the identification of HLA ligands suitable for pharmaceutical therapies

### Description
For more than two decades naturally presented, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted peptides (immunopeptidome) have been eluted and sequenced using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Since, identified disease-associated HLA ligands have been characterized and evaluated as potential active substances. Treatments based on HLA-presented peptides have shown promising results in clinical application as personalized T cell-based immunotherapy. Peptide vaccination cocktails are produced as investigational medicinal products under GMP conditions. In order to support clinical trials based on HLA-presented tumor-associated antigens, in this study the sensitive LC-MS/MS antigen identification pipeline was fully validated according to the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines. The immunopeptidomes of JY cells with or without spiked-in, isotope labeled peptides, were reliably identified using a data-dependent acquisition method. As the LC-MS/MS pipeline is used for identification purposes, the validation parameters include accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of detection and robustness.

### Sample Protocol
The EBV-transformed human B-cell line JY (ECACC 94022533,) was cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 ̊C, washed two times with cold PBS and aliquots containing 75 million cells were frozen and stored at -80 ̊C until use. The cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination via PCR. HLA class I molecules were isolated using standard immunoaffinity purification using the HLA class I-specific monoclonal antibody W6/32. First, the cell pellets were lysed in 10 mM CHAPS (Applichem)/PBS (Lonza) containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and subsequently HLA molecules were purified using the pan-HLA class I–specific monoclonal W6/32 Ab covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.). Repeated addition of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck) eluted HLA molecules and peptides. The peptides were isolated employing ultrafiltration with centrifugal filter units (Amicon; Merck Millipore), extracted and desalted using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Merck Milli-pore), eluted in 35 µl acetonitrile (Merck)/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, vacuum centrifuged to 5 µl, and resuspended in 25 µl of 1% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the peptide solutions were stored at -20 ̊C until analysis by LC-MS/MS.  Peptides were separated by nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (nanoUHPLC, UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex) and subsequently analyzed in an on-line coupled Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Volumes of 5 μl peptide solution were injected onto a 75 μm × 2 cm trapping column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, Dionex) at 4 μl/min for 5.75 min in five technical replicates. Subsequently, peptide separation was performed at 50°C at a flow rate of 300 nl/min on a 50 μm × 25 cm separation column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, Dionex) applying a gradient ranging from 2.4 to 32.0% of AcN over the course of 90 min. Eluted peptides were ionized by nanospray ionization and analyzed in the mass spectrometer implementing top speed collision-induced dissociation fragmentation. First, precursor ions were isolated in the quadrupole and subsequently fragmented in the ion trap and lastly, product ions were recorded in the Orbitrap. The mass range was limited to 400–650 m/z with charge states 2+ and 3+ selected for fragmentation and the resolution was set to 120.000.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed against the human proteome included in the Swiss-Prot database (http://www.uniprot.org, release September 27, 2013; containing 20,279 reviewed protein sequences) applying the SequestHT algorithm in the Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3; Thermo Fisher) software. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, product ions mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da and oxidized methionine was allowed as the only dynamic modification. Percolator-assisted false discovery rate (FDR) calculation was set at a target value of q ≤ 0.05 (5% FDR). Peptide-spectrum matches with q ≤ 0.05 were ﬁltered according to additional orthogonal parameters to ensure spectral quality and validity. Peptide lengths were limited to 8–12 aa.

### Publication Abstract
For more than two decades naturally presented, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted peptides (immunopeptidome) have been eluted and sequenced using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Since, identified disease-associated HLA ligands have been characterized and evaluated as potential active substances. Treatments based on HLA-presented peptides have shown promising results in clinical application as personalized T cell-based immunotherapy. Peptide vaccination cocktails are produced as investigational medicinal products under GMP conditions. To support clinical trials based on HLA-presented tumor-associated antigens, in this study the sensitive LC-MS/MS HLA class I antigen identification pipeline was fully validated for our technical equipment according to the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines.The immunopeptidomes of JY cells with or without spiked-in, isotope labeled peptides, of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers as well as a chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a bladder cancer sample were reliably identified using a data-dependent acquisition method. As the LC-MS/MS pipeline is used for identification purposes, the validation parameters include accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of detection and robustness.
