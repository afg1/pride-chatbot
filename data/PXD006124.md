### Title
Murine RPE proteome and phosphoproteome

### Description
One of the major biological functions accomplished by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is the clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through a multistep process referred to as phagocytosis. Phagocytosis helps maintain the viability of photoreceptors which otherwise could succumb to the high metabolic flux and photo-oxidative stress associated with visual processing. Regulatory mechanisms underlying phagocytosis in the RPE are not fully understood, although dysfunction of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple human retinal degenerative disorders, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here we present an integrated analysis of phagocytosing cultured-RPE cells.

### Sample Protocol
RPE cells were isolated from eyes removed from mice at 7:30 am and 3 pm (10 mice for each sample, n=3 for each time point). Disrupted cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of RIPA buffer and precipitated with 5 mL ice-cold acetone at -20 °C overnight. Precipitates were centrifuged, washed with ice-cold acetone, re-solubilized in 50 mM NH4HCO3/8 M urea buffer, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay. Then 650 μg of protein in each sample was reduced, alkylated, digested with LysC and trypsin, desalted with a SepPak C18 cartridge, and dried in a speed-vac. For quantitative analyses stable isotope dimethyl labeling of peptides was performed. Briefly, samples were reconstituted in 100 mM TEAB buffer, pH 8.0, divided into halves (325 μg of digested peptides each) which were isotopically labeled with either 0.2% CH2O and 30 mM NaBH3CN (light [L] form labeling) or 0.2% CD2O and 30 mM NaBH3CN (intermediate [M] form labeling). Ammonium solution was used to quench the reaction and formic acid to acidify the samples. Next, six of the intermediate labeled peptide samples (325 μg each) were pooled together as a reference and spiked into each light sample (325 μg) with a 1:1 protein weight ratio (a total of 650 μg peptides in each sample). Resulting samples were desalted with SepPak C18 cartridges, and dried by a speed-vac. In each case, 65 μg of peptides were used for the proteome analysis, whereas 585 μg peptides were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment with Ti4+-IMAC beads used for the phosphoproteome analysis.

### Data Protocol
Data was analyzed and quantified with MaxQuant (version 1.3.0.5) using Andromeda as a search engine against the UniProt database restricted to Mouse (Mus musculus, released at 2013 May) taxonomy concatenated with a decoy of reversed sequences. The precursor ion mass tolerance was 6 ppm and fragment mass deviation was 0.5 Da for MS/MS spectra. The search included variable modifications of methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation and a fixed modification of Cys carbamidomethylation. Trypsin/P was set as the cleavage specificity with two missed cleavages. For peptide and protein identification, the cutoff false discovery rates (FDRs) were both set to 0.01 and the minimum peptide length was set to 7. The phospho (STY) sites files were imported into Perseus (version 1.5.2.4) for the respective analysis.   

### Publication Abstract
One of the major biological functions of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is the clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through a multistep process resembling phagocytosis. RPE phagocytosis helps maintain the viability of photoreceptors that otherwise could succumb to the high metabolic flux and photo-oxidative stress associated with visual processing. The regulatory mechanisms underlying phagocytosis in the RPE are not fully understood, although dysfunction of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple human retinal degenerative disorders, including age-related macular degeneration. Here, we present an integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analysis of phagocytosing RPE cells, utilizing three different experimental models: the human-derived RPE-like cell line ARPE-19, cultured murine primary RPE cells, and RPE samples from live mice. Our combined results indicated that early stages of phagocytosis in the RPE are mainly characterized by pronounced changes in the protein phosphorylation level. Global phosphoprotein enrichment analysis revealed involvement of PI3K/Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and MEK/ERK pathways in the regulation of RPE phagocytosis, confirmed by immunoblot analyses and <i>in vitro</i> phagocytosis assays. Most strikingly, phagocytosis of POS by cultured RPE cells was almost completely blocked by pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt. Our findings, along with those of previous studies, indicate that these phosphorylation events allow the RPE to integrate multiple signals instigated by shed POS at different stages of the phagocytic process.
