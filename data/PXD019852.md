### Title
Holistic proteome analyses of heart samples from GHR-deficient (GHR-KO) pigs

### Description
A proteomics analysis of heart samples from GH receptor deficient (GHR-KO) pigs has been performed. This animal model is unique to study consequences of lacking GH actions. In this study, we used LC-MS/MS to capture alterations in the heart proteome of this clinically relevant large animal model.

### Sample Protocol
Tissue homogenization and lysis was performed using ART-MicraD8 homogenizer (ART Prozess- & Labortechnik, Müllheim, Germany) and subsequent centrifugation through QIA-Shredder devices (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Protein concentrations were measured using Pierce 660 nm protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Proteins were reduced at a concentration of 4.5 mM DTE/2 mM TCEP for 30 min. Cysteine residues were blocked for 30 min at a concentration of 8.3 mM iodoacetamide. Protein digestion was done with 1:50 (enzyme:substrate) lysyl endopeptidase (Fujifilm Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 4 hours at 37 °C and 1:50 (enzyme:substrate) porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 18 hours at 37 °C.

### Data Protocol
For label-free quantification MS data were processed, using MaxQuant V1.6.2.10 and the Sus scrofa subset of the NCBI database (NCBI RefSeq Sus scrofa Annotation Release 106 Scrofa 11.1, available at: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000003025.6/). For identification, the following parameters were used: i) Enzyme: Trypsin; ii) Mass tolerance precursor: 10 ppm; iii) Mass tolerance MS/MS: 0.02 Da; iv) Fixed modification: Carbamidomethylation of cysteine; v) Variable modifications: oxidized methionine. FDRs at the peptide and protein level were set to 1%.
