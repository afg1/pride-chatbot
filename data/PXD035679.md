### Title
Syndecan-4 is a maestro of gastric cancer cell invasion and communication that underscores poor survival

### Description
Gastric cancer is a dominating cause of cancer-associated mortality with limited therapeutic options. Here, we show that syndecan-4 (SDC4), a plasma membrane proteoglycan, is highly expressed in intestinal subtype gastric tumours and that this signature associates with patients’ poor survival. Further, we mechanistically demonstrate that SDC4 is a master regulator of gastric cancer motility and invasion. We also find that SDC4 conjugated with heparan sulfate chains is efficiently sorted in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Interestingly, SDC4 in EVs regulates gastric cancer cell-derived EV organ distribution, uptake and functional effects in recipient cells. Specifically, we show that SDC4 knockout disrupts the tropism of EVs for the common gastric cancer metastatic sites. Our findings set the basis of the molecular implications of SDC4 expression in gastric cancer cells and open new perspectives on the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the glycan-EV axis to limit tumour progression.

### Sample Protocol
Sample identification:
JP_WT1, JP_WT2, JP_WT3 – MKN74 wild-type cells (TR1, 2  - Technical replicates);
JP_KO1, JP_KO2, JP_KO3 - MKN74 SDC4 knock-out cells (TR1, 2  - Technical replicates);
JP_KO_WT1, JP_KO_WT2, JP_KO_WT3 – MKN74 SDC4 knock-out cells treated with wild-type EVs  (TR1, 2  - Technical replicates);
WT1, WT2 – EVs from MKN74 wild-type cells;
KO1, KO2 – EVs from MKN74 SDC4 knock-out cells.

Proteins were solubilized with 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 40 mM chloroacetamide for 10 minutes at 95ºC at 1000 rpm (Thermomixer, Eppendorf). Each sample was processed for proteomics analysis following the solid-phase-enhanced sample-preparation (SP3) protocol as described in PMID30464214. Enzymatic digestion was performed with Trypsin/LysC overnight at 37ºC at 1000 rpm. Protein identification and quantitation was performed by nanoLC-MS/MS. This equipment is composed by an Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system coupled to a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Samples were loaded onto a trapping cartridge (Acclaim PepMap C18 100Å, 5 mm x 300 µm i.d., 160454, Thermo Scientific) in a mobile phase of 2% ACN, 0.1% FA at 10 µL/min. After 3 min loading, the trap column was switched in-line to a 50 cm by 75μm inner diameter EASY-Spray column (ES803, PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 μm, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) at 250 nL/min. Separation was generated by mixing A: 0.1% FA, and B: 80% ACN, with the following gradient:  5 min (2.5% B to 10% B), 120 min (10% B to 30% B), 20 min (30% B to 50% B), 5 min (50% B to 99% B) and 10 min (hold 99% B). Subsequently, the column was equilibrated with 2.5% B for 17 min. Data acquisition was controlled by Xcalibur 4.0 and Tune 2.11 software (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent (dd) positive acquisition mode alternating between a full scan (m/z 380-1580) and subsequent HCD MS/MS of the 10 most intense peaks from full scan (normalized collision energy of 27%). ESI spray voltage was 1.9 kV.  Global settings: use lock masses best (m/z 445.12003), lock mass injection Full MS, chrom. peak width (FWHM) 15s. Full scan settings: 70k resolution (m/z 200), AGC target 3e6, maximum injection time 120 ms. dd settings: minimum AGC target 8e3, intensity threshold 7.3e4, charge exclusion: unassigned, 1, 8, >8, peptide match preferred, exclude isotopes on, dynamic exclusion 45s. MS2 settings: microscans 1, resolution 35k (m/z 200), AGC target 2e5, maximum injection time 110 ms, isolation window 2.0 m/z, isolation offset 0.0 m/z, spectrum data type profile.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.5.0.400 software (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the UniProt database for the Homo sapiens reviewed Proteome 2021_03 with 20371 entries and the NIST human spectral library. A common protein contaminant list from MaxQuant was also considered. The MSPepSearch and Sequest HT search engines were used to identify tryptic peptides. The ion mass tolerance was 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions for both software. Maximum allowed missing cleavage sites was set 2. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was defined as constant modification. Methionine oxidation, deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, peptide terminus glutamine to pyroglutamate, and protein N-terminus acetylation, Met-loss and Met-loss+acetyl were defined as variable modifications. Peptide confidence was set to high.  The processing node Percolator was enabled with the following settings: maximum delta Cn 0.05; decoy database search target FDR 1%, validation based on q-value. Protein label free quantitation was performed with the Minora feature detector node at the processing step. Precursor ions quantification was performing at the processing step with the following parameters: Peptides to use all peptides, precursor abundance based on intensity, and normalization based on total peptide amount. For data analysis the following filters were applied: (i) common contaminants were removed; (ii) protein identification p-value ≤ 0.01; (iii) unique/razor peptides were equal or greater than 1.

### Publication Abstract
Gastric cancer is a dominating cause of cancer-associated mortality with limited therapeutic options. Here, we show that syndecan-4 (SDC4), a transmembrane proteoglycan, is highly expressed in intestinal subtype gastric tumors and that this signature associates with patient poor survival. Further, we mechanistically demonstrate that SDC4 is a master regulator of gastric cancer cell motility and invasion. We also find that SDC4 decorated with heparan sulfate is efficiently sorted in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Interestingly, SDC4 in EVs regulates gastric cancer cell-derived EV organ distribution, uptake, and functional effects in recipient cells. Specifically, we show that <i>SDC4</i> knockout disrupts the tropism of EVs for the common gastric cancer metastatic sites. Our findings set the basis for the molecular implications of SDC4 expression in gastric cancer cells and provide broader perspectives on the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the glycan-EV axis to limit tumor progression.
