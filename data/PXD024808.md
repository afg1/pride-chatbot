### Title
Profile of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome

### Description
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose success as a pathogen relies on its ability to repurpose host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to form its own RNA interactome. Here, we developed and applied a robust ribonucleoprotein capture protocol to uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome. We report 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs including general antiviral factors such as ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, and PARP12. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus HCoV-OC43 revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between viral RNAs and host proteins. Network and transcriptome analyses delineated antiviral RBPs stimulated by JAK-STAT signaling and proviral RBPs responsible for hijacking multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. By knockdown experiments, we further found that these viral-RNA-interacting RBPs act against or in favor of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

### Sample Protocol
Virus infected cells were detached from culture vessels by trypsin and cell pellets were resuspended with ice-cold PBS. 12 mL cell suspensions were dispersed in 150 mm dishes to irradiate 254 nm UV for 2.5 J/cm2 using BIO-LINK BLX-254 for SARS-CoV-2 or 0.8 J/cm2 using Spectrolinker XL-1500 for HCoV-OC43. UV-crosslinked cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in TURBO DNase solution (150 Units per flask) and incubated at 37�숦 for 30 minutes. DNA digested cells were supplemented with equal volume of pre-heated 2X lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.5, 1 M LiCl, 1% LDS, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT and 8 M urea) and denatured by incubating at 68째C for 30 minutes. Per replicate, cell lysate from 1 flask (T-175) were mixed with 20 쨉g biotin probe pools (Probe I or Probe II) and hybridized by incubating at 68�숦 for 30 minutes in final 1 mL volume. Biotin-labeled RNP lysates were supplemented with streptavidin beads (1 mL per replicate, New England Biolabs) and captured by rotating at room temperature overnight. Probe-enriched RNP beads were washed with 1X lysis buffer twice and transferred to fresh tubes, followed by final wash with detergent-free wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA). 1/10th of beads were set aside for assessment of RNA contents by RT-qPCR and another 1/10th of beads were used for silver staining (KOMA biotech). The remaining 8/10th of beads were digested with 100 units of Benzonase nuclease (Millipore) at 37째C for 1 hour. For on-bead peptide digestion, nuclease treated beads were suspended to final 8 M urea and reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 hour each at 37째C, and diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) to final 1 M urea. These bead suspensions were supplemented with 300 ng Trypsin (Thermo Scientific, MS grade) and 1 mM CaCl2 and digested overnight at 37째C. Peptide solutions were separated from magnetic beads and further processed with HiPPR detergent removal spin columns (Thermo Scientific) and desalted by reverse phase C18 ziptip (Millipore). After the clean up and dry down, the samples were reconstituted with 20 關L of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometric raw data files were processed for Label-Free Quantification with MaxQuant (version 1.6.15.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008) using the built-in Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) at default settings with a few exceptions. Briefly, for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) search, cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Tolerance for the first and main PSM search were 20 and 4.5 ppm, respectively. Peptides from common contaminant proteins were identified by utilizing the contaminant database provided by MaxQuant. FDR threshold of 1% was used for both the peptide and protein level. The match-between-runs option was enabled with default parameters in the identification step. Finally, LFQ was performed for those with a minimum ratio count of 1.
