### Title
Microbial Peptides Activate Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Glioblastoma

### Description
Microbial organisms play key roles in numerous physiological processes in the human body and have recently been shown to modify the response to cancer radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that HLA molecules of both glioblastoma tissues as well as tumor cell lines present bacteria-specific peptides. This finding prompted us to examine whether tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) recognize intratumoral microbiota. Indeed, bacterial peptides eluted from HLA-DR II molecules are recognized by both TILs, albeit weakly, and peripheral blood-derived memory CD4+ T cells, which, upon stimulation with bacterial peptides, also recognize several tumor antigens. Furthermore, using an unbiased antigen discovery approach for a TIL CD4+ T cell clone (TCC) we show that it recognizes a broad spectrum of peptides from pathogenic bacteria, commensal gut microbiota and also glioblastoma-related tumor antigens. These peptides were strongly stimulatory for bulk TILs and peripheral blood memory cells. Our data hint at how bacterial pathogens and bacterial gut microbiota can be involved in specific immune recognition of tumor antigens.

### Sample Protocol
In order to analyze the immunopeptidomes of the tumor tissues and cell lines, frozen tissues and frozen cell pellets were homogenized in CHAPS-containing lysis buffer as previously described to perform standard immunoaffinity chromatographyprocessed as previously described 36. Briefly, tumor tissues was washed thoroughly using PBS. Next, they were cut into small pieces and treated with digestion mix including RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) containing 10% FCS (Eurobio), 1 mg/ml of collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/ml of DNaseI (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 42 minutes at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding PBS with 2mM EDTA (Invitrogen) and the lysates passed through a filter mesh. Next, tumor cells were isolated using Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient. The HLA-II immunopeptidomes molecules were isolated using the HLA-DR-specific antibody (L243) as well as the pan-HLA-II-specific antibody Tü39 36 (mixed 1:1, at least 1 mg or 1 mg per 1 g of tissue, both produced in-house at the Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute of for Cell Biology, University of Tübingen) and subsequent elution of the HLA-bound peptides. Peptide eluated were analyzed by nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (Dionex UltimateTM 3000 Series liquid chromatography system) and tandem mass spectrometry (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, Thermo Fisher Scientific)The amino acid sequence of the peptides was characterized using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, LTQ Orbitrap XL).

### Data Protocol
Data-dependent Aacquisition of data was always conducted in technical triplicates as described before 36. The raw MS data ﬁles were converted into “mgf” using ThermoRawFileParser (Hulstaert et al., 2020) and analyzed on MASCOT software with an non-redundant eubacteria UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database (December 12, 2020 with 334,492 entries) and search parameters were 0.5 Da fragment mass tolerance and 5 ppm precursor with no enzyme.
