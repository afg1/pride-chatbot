### Title
Remodeling of the cardiac extracellular matrix proteome during chronological and pathological aging

### Description
Impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory disorders that can lead to cellular dysfunction, aging, and disease progression. The ECM of the aged heart and its effects on cardiac cells during chronological and pathological aging are relatively poorly understood in several speciesacross species. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantitatively characterize age-related remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) of mice and humans during chronological and pathological (Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)) aging. Of the approximately 300 ECM proteins quantified, we identified 13 proteins that were increased, including lactadherin (MFGE8), collagen VI 6 (COL6A6), vitronectin (VTN) and immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (IGHM), whereas fibulin-5 (FBLN5) was decreased in most of the data sets analyzed. We show that lactadherin accumulates with age in large cardiac blood vessels and when immobilized, triggers phosphorylation of several phosphosites of GSK3B, MAPK isoforms 1, 3, and 14, and MTOR kinases in aortic endothelial cells (ECs). In addition, immobilized lactadherin increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers associated with an aging phenotype. These results extend our knowledge of the LV proteome remodeling induced by chronological and pathological aging in different species (mouse and human). The lactadherin-triggered changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of ECs suggest a straight link between ECM component remodeling and the aging process of ECs. 

### Sample Protocol
MAECs were grown in basal medium supplemented with 5% FBS and supplements, according to the supplier’s instructions. Cells were used between passages 4 and 6. Serum-depleted cells (18 h in basal medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were trypsinized and seeded in coated wells containing 10ug/ml of recombinant mouse lactadherin for short (1 h) and long (24 h) stimulation. Cells were scraped into 200 µl PBS on ice, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 xg for 10 min, and pellets were stored at -20 °C until further use. Pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM Sodium Chloride (Roth, P029.2), 1 % Triton X-100 (v/v, Roth, 3051.3), 0.5 % Sodium Deoxycholate (Thermo Fisher, 89904), 0.1 % SDS (w/v, Sigma, -250G), 50 mM Tris (Roth, 4855.2). The lysates (corresponding to 50 µg protein extract) were precipitated with acetone, digested to peptides and desalted as described in “Sample preparation for MS analysis”. The final desalting step was performed with 50 µl of a buffer solution of 80% ACN and 0.1% TFA. Prior to phosphopeptide enrichment, samples were filled up to 210 µl with 80% ACN and 0.1% TFA buffer solution. Phosphorylated peptides were enriched with Fe(III)-NTA cartridges (Agilent Technologies G 5496-60085) using the AssayMAP Bravo Platform (Agilent Technologies), as described in (Post, Penning et al. 2017). Briefly, Fe(III)-NTA cartridges were washed with 250 μl 100% ACN/0.1% TFA and conditioned with 250 μl loading buffer consisting of 80% ACN and 0.1% TFA. After loading the samples into the cartridge, the columns were washed with 250 μl of loading buffer and then the phosphopeptides were eluted with 25 μl 1% ammonia directly into 25 μl 10% FA in water. Samples were dried using a speed vacuum centrifuge and stored at −20 °C until MS analysis. Data Independent Acquisition for enriched phosphopeptides Elutions from phosphopeptide enrichment or flowthroughs (used for whole proteome analysis) were reconstituted in 5% ACN, 95% Milli-Q water, with 0.1% FA and spiked with iRT peptides (Biognosys, Switzerland). Peptides were separated in trap/elute mode using the nanoAcquity M-Class Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system (Waters, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a trapping (Waters nanoEase M/Z Symmetry C18, 5μm, 180 μm x 20 mm) and an analytical column (Waters nanoEase M/Z Peptide C18, 1.7μm, 75μm x 250mm). Solvent A was water and 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Between 40 and 80% of the samples were loaded onto the trapping column with a constant flow of solvent A at 5 μl/min. The trapping time was 6 minutes. Peptides were eluted over the analytical column at a constant flow of 0.3 μl/min. During the elution step, the percentage of solvent B increased nonlinearly from 0–40% in 60 min for phosphopetide analysis and in 120 min for whole proteome analysis. For MS analysis, the LC was coupled to an Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer using the Proxeon nanospray source. Peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a Pico-Tip Emitter 360-μm outer diameter × 20-μm inner diameter, 10-μm tip (New Objective) heated at 300 °C, with a spray voltage of 2.2 kV applied. The capillary temperature was set at 300°C. The radio frequency (RF) was set to 30%. For analysis of the whole proteome flowthroughs in DIA mode, full-scan MS spectra with a mass range of 350–1650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 FWHM. The default charge state was set to 3+. The filling time was set to a maximum of 60 ms with a limit of 3 × 106 ions. DIA scans were acquired with 40 mass window segments of differing widths over the MS1 mass range. Higher collisional dissociation fragmentation (stepped normalized collision energy; 25.5, 27, and 30%) was applied, and MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 FWHM with a fixed first mass of 200 m/z after accumulation of 3 × 106 ions or after the filling time of 35 ms (whichever came first).  For the analysis of the phosphopeptide enrichment fraction, MS full scan spectra with a mass range of 350–1650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 FWHM. The default charge state was set to 3+. The filling time was set to a maximum of 60 ms with a limit of 3 × 106 ions. DIA scans were acquired with 30 mass window segments of differing widths over the MS1 mass range. Higher collisional dissociation fragmentation (stepped normalized collision energy; 25.5, 27, and 30%) was applied, and MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 FWHM with a fixed first mass of 200 m/z after accumulation of 3 × 106 ions or after the filling time of 47 ms (whichever came first). Data were acquired in profile mode. Xcalibur 4.4 (Thermo Fisher) and Orbitrap Exploris 480 Tune version 2.0 were used for data acquisition and raw data processing.

### Data Protocol
Data processing for samples with Data Independent Acquisition (DIA)  Raw data from phosphopeptide enrichment elutions and flowthroughs (whole proteome) were analyzed using the directDIA pipeline in Spectronaut Professional v.15 (Biognosys AG). Data were searched against a species specific (Uniprot database, Swissprot entry only, release 2016_01 for Mus musculus) and a common contaminants database. Data were searched with the following modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C) (fixed) and Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), Phospho (STY) (variable, only for phosphopeptide enrichment elutions). PTM localization probability was set to 0.75. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages for trypsin and 5 variable modifications were allowed. Identifications were filtered to achieve an FDR of 1 % at the peptide and protein levels.  For phosphopeptide enrichment flowthroughs (whole proteome), relative quantification was performed in Spectronaut for each pairwise comparison using replicate samples from each condition with default settings, except: Major Group Quantity = median peptide quantity; Major Group Top N = OFF; Minor Group Quantity = median precursor quantity; Minor Group Top N = OFF; Data Filtering = Q value; Normalization Strategy = Local normalization; Row Selection = Automatic; Exclude Single Hit Proteins = TRUE. Tests for differential abundance were performed using an un-paired t-test between replicates. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the method described by Storey (Storey 2002) to obtain false discovery rate adjusted p values (q values). Proteins with q<0.05 and absolute log2 fold change>0.58 were considered significantly affected unless otherwise stated. For phosphopeptide enrichment elutions, peptide report table was exported from Spectronaut and further processed with R (v.3.6.3) and R studio server (v. 1.2.5042) using in-house pipelines and scripts. Phosphosite-level intensities were determined by summing the intensities of all precursors containing a given phosphosite. Phosphosite intensities were log2-transformed and normalized by quantile normalization using the preprocessCore library (Bolstad et al., 2003). Differences in phosphosite levels were determined statistically using a paired Student’s t-test moderated by the empirical Bayes method as implemented in the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015). False discovery rate was estimated using fdrtool (Strimmer, 2008). The PhosR package ((Kim et al., 2021)) with default settings was used to identify the most highly regulated kinases and the corresponding regulated top phosphosites.

### Publication Abstract
Impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory disorders that can lead to cellular dysfunction, aging, and disease progression. The ECM of the aged heart and its effects on cardiac cells during chronological and pathological aging are poorly understood across species. For this purpose, we first used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantitatively characterize age-related remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) of mice and humans during chronological and pathological (Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)) aging. Of the approximately 300 ECM and ECM-associated proteins quantified (named as Matrisome), we identified 13 proteins that were increased during aging, including lactadherin (MFGE8), collagen VI &#x3b1;6 (COL6A6), vitronectin (VTN) and immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (IGHM), whereas fibulin-5 (FBLN5) was decreased in most of the data sets analyzed. We show that lactadherin accumulates with age in large cardiac blood vessels and when immobilized, triggers phosphorylation of several phosphosites of GSK3B, MAPK isoforms 1, 3, and 14, and MTOR kinases in aortic endothelial cells (ECs). In addition, immobilized lactadherin increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers associated with an aging phenotype. These results extend our knowledge of the LV proteome remodeling induced by chronological and pathological aging in different species (mouse and human). The lactadherin-triggered changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of ECs suggest a straight link between ECM component remodeling and the aging process of ECs, which may provide an additional layer to prevent cardiac aging.
