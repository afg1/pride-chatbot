### Title
Phosphoproteomics analysis of Selinexor response in AML ex vivo patient samples and cell lines

### Description
We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to perform a phosphoproteomics analysis of selinexor-treated ex vivo AML patient samples (n=20) and 4 AML cell lines (PL-21, NOMO-1, GDM-1 and MV4-11). For quantitative phosphoproteomics, we used a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based approach. Conditions for the TMT 11-plex (Ex vivo samples) and TMT 8-plex (AML cell lines) setups are specified below. Cells were treated with 1 M selinexor (also known as KPT-330) or 0.1% DMSO for 6 hours. The experimental treatment conditions and TMT11-plex (ex vivo samples) and TMT8-plex (cell lines) labeling schemes are specified below:   TMT-11-plex TMT channel Patient no Treatment Set 1 126 Ex_24 DMSO Set 1 127N Ex_24 Selinexor Set 1 127C Ex_25 DMSO Set 1 128N Ex_25 Selinexor Set 1 128C Ex_34 DMSO Set 1 129N Ex_34 Selinexor Set 1 129C Ex_41 DMSO Set 1 130N Ex_41 Selinexor Set 1 130C Ex_44 DMSO Set 1 131N Ex_44 Selinexor Set 1 131C Mix pool Mix pool Set 2 126 Ex_9 DMSO Set 2 127N Ex_9 Selinexor Set 2 127C Ex_18 DMSO Set 2 128N Ex_18 Selinexor Set 2 128C Ex_27 DMSO Set 2 129N Ex_27 Selinexor Set 2 129C Ex_29 DMSO Set 2 130N Ex_29 Selinexor Set 2 130C Ex_36 DMSO Set 2 131N Ex_36 Selinexor Set 2 131C Mix pool Mix pool Set 3 126 Ex_8 DMSO Set 3 127N Ex_8 Selinexor Set 3 127C Ex_13 DMSO Set 3 128N Ex_13 Selinexor Set 3 128C Ex_14 DMSO Set 3 129N Ex_14 Selinexor Set 3 129C Ex_19 DMSO Set 3 130N Ex_19 Selinexor Set 3 130C Ex_40 DMSO Set 3 131N Ex_40 Selinexor Set 3 131C Mix pool Mix pool Set 4 126 Ex_6 DMSO Set 4 127N Ex_6 Selinexor Set 4 127C Ex_15 DMSO Set 4 128N Ex_15 Selinexor Set 4 128C Ex_28 DMSO Set 4 129N Ex_28 Selinexor Set 4 129C Ex_39 DMSO Set 4 130N Ex_39 Selinexor Set 4 130C Ex_42 DMSO Set 4 131N Ex_42 Selinexor Set 4 131C Mix pool Mix pool  AML cell lines: TMT-8-plex TMT channel Treatment Replicate GDM-1 126 DMSO 1 GDM-1 127N DMSO 2 GDM-1 127C DMSO 3 GDM-1 128N DMSO 4 GDM-1 128C Selinexor 1 GDM-1 129N Selinexor 2 GDM-1 129C Selinexor 3 GDM-1 130N Selinexor 4 MV4-11 126 DMSO 1 MV4-11 127N DMSO 2 MV4-11 127C DMSO 3 MV4-11 128N DMSO 4 MV4-11 128C Selinexor 1 MV4-11 129N Selinexor 2 MV4-11 129C Selinexor 3 MV4-11 130N Selinexor 4 NOMO-1 126 DMSO 1 NOMO-1 127N DMSO 2 NOMO-1 127C DMSO 3 NOMO-1 128N DMSO 4 NOMO-1 128C Selinexor 1 NOMO-1 129N Selinexor 2 NOMO-1 129C Selinexor 3 NOMO-1 130N Selinexor 4 PL-21 126 DMSO 1 PL-21 127N DMSO 2 PL-21 127C DMSO 3 PL-21 128N DMSO 4 PL-21 128C Selinexor 1 PL-21 129N Selinexor 2 PL-21 129C Selinexor 3 PL-21 130N Selinexor 4

### Sample Protocol
Following treatment with selinexor or DMSO, cells for each condition were lysed in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 5 mM TCEP and 10 mM CAA for 10 min at 99°C and whole cell extracts were sonicated. Cell lysates were digested by Lys-C (Wako) in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 1 hour, followed by a dilution with 25 mM Tris pH 8.5, to 2 M guanidine-HCl and further digested overnight with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) 1:100 (w/w). Protease activity was quenched by acidification with TFA and the resulting peptide mixture was concentrated on C18 Sep-Pak (Waters). Peptides were eluted with 40% ACN, followed by 60% ACN. For each TMT multiplex analysis equal amounts of peptide from each condition (Ex vivo - set 1: 100 g, set 2: 76 g, set 3: 67 g, set 4: 51 g/sample and for all cell line conditions: 300 g peptide/condition) were labeled with one of 11 or 8 different TMT-reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoScientific). After labeling, samples were combined and the mix was adjusted to 80% ACN, 6% TFA. Phosphopeptides were enriched by two sequential rounds of titansphere chromatography. The eluted phosphopeptides were concentrated in a SpeedVac and fractionated with high-pH-reversed-phase fractionation. Additionally for cell lines only single-shot analysis was performed on aliquots from the first and second enrichment step. The resulting 12 fractions from each TMT-multiplex labeled peptide mixture and cell line single-shot samples were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive HFx orbitrap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.17 using the Andromeda search engine.

### Publication Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with variable patient responses to therapy. Selinexor, an inhibitor of nuclear export, has shown promising clinical activity for AML. To identify the molecular context for monotherapy sensitivity as well as rational drug combinations, we profile selinexor signaling responses using phosphoproteomics in primary AML patient samples and cell lines. Functional phosphosite scoring reveals that p53 function is required for selinexor sensitivity consistent with enhanced efficacy of selinexor in combination with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a. Moreover, combining selinexor with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 overcomes dysregulated AKT-FOXO3 signaling in resistant cells, resulting in synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Using high-throughput spatial proteomics to profile subcellular compartments, we measure global proteome and phospho-proteome dynamics, providing direct evidence of nuclear translocation of FOXO3 upon combination treatment. Our data demonstrate the potential of phosphoproteomics and functional phosphorylation site scoring to successfully pinpoint key targetable signaling hubs for rational drug combinations.
