### Title
Equine energy-storing SDFT tendon development, Proteomic analysis of IFM and fascicles through development

### Description
Equine energy-storing SDFT tendon development, Proteomic analysis of IFM and fascicles through development

### Sample Protocol
Samples were collected from the SDFT IFM and fascicles with laser capture microdissection of frozen SDFT sections

### Data Protocol
Files were processed in Peaks 8, label free quantification was carried out following normalisation of samples for area collected and volume loaded, filters of significance 20 and 2 fold change were used.

### Publication Abstract
Mature connective tissues demonstrate highly specialised properties, remarkably adapted to meet their functional requirements. Tissue adaptation to environmental cues can occur throughout life and poor adaptation commonly results in injury. However, the temporal nature and drivers of functional adaptation remain undefined. Here, we explore functional adaptation and specialisation of mechanically loaded tissues using tendon; a simple aligned biological composite, in which the collagen (fascicle) and surrounding predominantly non-collagenous matrix (interfascicular matrix) can be interrogated independently. Using an equine model of late development, we report the first phase-specific analysis of biomechanical, structural, and compositional changes seen in functional adaptation, demonstrating adaptation occurs postnatally, following mechanical loading, and is almost exclusively localised to the non-collagenous interfascicular matrix. These novel data redefine adaptation in connective tissue, highlighting the fundamental importance of non-collagenous matrix and suggesting that regenerative medicine strategies should change focus from the fibrous to the non-collagenous matrix of tissue.
