### Title
Peptidomics profiling of human intestine

### Description
The aim of the project is to generate a peptidomics map of gut hormone peptides along the gastrointestinal tract, starting with the stomach and including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. The tissues would be collected after surgery and the peptide fraction extracted and anlysed by nano LC-MS to identify what peptide hormones are present. These data will then be used to compare against the human transcriptome, and also for comparison against equivent peptides from murine intestinal extracts.

### Sample Protocol
Tissues (in the region of 40mg) were taken from patients undergoing surgery, placed into 6M GuHCl and homogenised using ceramic bead based homogenisers. The supernatant was transfered to tubes and precipitated using 80% ACN in water. The aqueous layer was removed, dried under oxygen free nitrogen, and reconstituted for solid phase extraction. The peptides were then reduced and alkylated to break any disulphide bonds prior to nano LC-MS/MS analysis and database searching using the PEAKS 8.5 software package.

### Data Protocol
PEAKS software 8.5 was used, with a "no enzyme" setting, with fixed carbamidomethylation on cysteine. Variable modifications included: C-terminal amide, N-terminal pyroglutamate and N-terminal acetylation
