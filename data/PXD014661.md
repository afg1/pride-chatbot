### Title
Identification of Toll-like receptor 4 interacting partner through immunoprecipitation-based chemical cross-linking proteomics

### Description
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a transmembrane protein. Its activation leads to NF-kB signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokines’ production that are responsible for activating innate immunity system. Here, we design a co-immunoprecipitation based cross-linking proteomics approach to reveal the TLR-4 interactome upon treatment of lipopolysaccharides and statin drug in HA-TLR-4 transfected HEK293 cells. A total of 712 differentially expressed proteins were identified and quantified in this study. Selected candidate proteins, macrophage myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and creatine kinase, exclusively identified in the treatment of statin along with cross-linkers, were further validated by immunoblotting.

### Sample Protocol
HA-TLR4 Transfected HEK 293 Cells with or without cross linker was treated with LPS, Statin, Statin+LPS. Cell lysate were pulled down through affinity purification with Anti-HA magnetic beads. Protein sample was in-solution digested and analysed in LS-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
We took the immunoprecipitated proteins and reduced and alkylated them followed by trypsin (porcine) (MS Grade) at 37°C for overnight. [40] Next, we added formic acid to the peptides to bring pH < 3 and stop trypsin activity. Finally, we dried the samples by speed vacuum and then dissolved in 0.1% formic acid solution followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.  We analyzed the digested peptides by nano-LC-MS/MS using a Velos Pro Dual-Pressure Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA). We loaded the peptides into an analytical column and separated them by reverse phase chromatography using a 15 cm column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC) with an inner diameter of 75 μm and packed with 2 μm C18 particles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). We used multi-step gradients of 4-90% solvent B (A: 0.1% formic acid in water; B: 95% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water) over 70 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a total run time of 90 min and thus eluted the peptides from the nanocolumn. We kept the mass spectrometer operating in a positive ionization mode with nanospray voltage set at 2.50-3.00 kV and source temperature at 275oC. We set the method such that, in a full MS scan, the three precursor ions with the most intense signal were consecutively isolated and fragmented to acquire their corresponding MS2 scans. Full MS scans were performed with 1 micro scan at a resolution of 3000, and a mass range of m/z 350-1500. Normalized collision energy (NCE) was set at 35%. Fragment ion spectra produced via high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) was acquired in the Linear Ion Trap with a resolution of 0.05 FWHM (full-width half maximum) with an Ultra Zoom-Scan between m/z 50-2000. A maximum injection volume of 5 µl was used during data acquisition with partial injection mode. The mass spectrometer was controlled in a data-dependent mode that toggled automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition. MS/MS data acquisition and processing were performed by XcaliburTM software, ver. 2.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA).

### Publication Abstract
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a receptor on an immune cell that can recognize the invasion of bacteria through their attachment with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Hence, LPS is a pro-immune response stimulus. On the other hand, statins are lipid-lowering drugs and can also lower immune cell responses. We used human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells engineered to express HA-tagged TLR-4 upon treatment with LPS, statin, and both statin and LPS to understand the effect of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. We performed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) of HA-tagged TLR4 and its interacting proteins in the HEK 293 extracted proteins. We utilized an ETD cleavable chemical cross-linker to capture weak and transient interactions with TLR4 protein. We tryptic digested immunoprecipitated and cross-linked proteins on beads, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the peptides. Thus, we utilized the label-free quantitation technique to measure the relative expression of proteins between treated and untreated samples. We identified 712 proteins across treated and untreated samples and performed protein network analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to reveal their protein networks. After filtering and evaluating protein expression, we identified macrophage myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKSL1) and creatine kinase proteins as a potential part of the inflammatory networks of TLR4. The results assumed that MARCKSL1 and creatine kinase proteins might be associated with a statin-induced anti-inflammatory response due to possible interaction with the TLR4.
