### Title
Function of constitutively active AtCPK1

### Description
One of the main Ca2+ decoders in plants are calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). Among them, AtCPK1 is one of the best studied as a positive regulator in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. Inactivation of the autoinhibitory domain of AtCPK1 (the mutated form of AtCPK1-Ca) provides constitutive activity of the kinase via imitation of the stress-induced Ca2+ increase. For the first time in the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of the overexpressed mutant AtCPK1-Ca form of Arabidopsis thaliana in transformed Vitis amurensis calli. In our previous studies, we have shown that overexpression of this mutated form led to dramatically enhanced specialised metabolism in plant cell cultures, including resveratrol in V. amurensis.

### Sample Protocol
We analysed upregulated and downregulated proteins in control and transgenic cell cultures using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI mass spectrometry. In the AtCPK1-Ca-transformed cells, we found an increased amount of pathogenesis-related proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed their overexpression in the AtCPK1-Ca-transformed cells. We hypothesised that various defence systems are activated by mutated AtCPK1. We believe that autoinhibitory domains in CDPKs could be promising targets for improving plant defence regulation. Our proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with an identifier.

### Data Protocol
All mass spectra were acquired with an Autoflex (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with a nitrogen laser operated in the positive reflector mode (standard method RP 700-3500 Da.par) under the control of FlexControl software (version 3.4; Bruker Daltonics). The analysis was performed in the automatic mode (AutoXecute â€“ automatic Run). The spectra were externally calibrated using the CalibratePeptideStandards.FAMSMethod and a standard calibration mixture (Protein Calibration Standard I, Bruker Daltonics). The data files were transferred to Flexanalysis software version 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics) for automated peak extraction. Assignment of the first monoisotopic signals in the spectra was performed automatically using the signal detection algorithm SNAP (Bruker Daltonics). For MS and MS/MS analyses, we used the PMF.FAMSMethod and SNAP_full_process.FALIFTMethod, respectively. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging 1500-5000 laser shots (300 shots on a step) acquired at the minimum laser power. The data were analyzed using BioTools (version 3.2; Bruker Daltonics). A peptide mass tolerance of 0.5 Da and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da were adopted for database searches. The m/z spectra were searched against the Arabidopsis thaliana NCBInr and SwissProt databases using the Mascot search engine. Further data were analyzed using UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) and other specialized databases and programs as indicated below.

### Publication Abstract
Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are one of the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> decoders in plants. Among them, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana AtCPK1</i> is one of the most studied CDPK genes as a positive regulator of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The mutated form of <i>AtCPK1</i>, in which the autoinhibitory domain is inactivated (<i>AtCPK1-Ca</i>), provides constitutive kinase activity by mimicking a stress-induced increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of <i>Vitis amurensis</i> calli overexpressing the <i>AtCPK1-Ca</i> form using untransformed calli as a control. In our previous studies, we have shown that the overexpression of this mutant form leads to the activation of secondary metabolism in plant cell cultures, including an increase in resveratrol biosynthesis in <i>V. amurensis</i> cell cultures. We analyzed upregulated and downregulated proteins in control and transgenic callus cultures using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). In calli transformed with <i>AtCPK1-Ca</i>, an increased amounts of pathogenesis-related proteins were found. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed this result.
