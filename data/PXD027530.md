### Title
Adsorptive microtiter plates as solid supports in affinity purification workflows

### Description
Affinity ligands such as antibodies are widely used in (bio)medical research for purifying proteins from complex biological samples. These ligands are generally immobilized onto solid supports which facilitate the separation of captured protein from sample matrix. Adsorptive microtiter plates are commonly used as solid supports prior to immunochemical detection (e.g. immunoassays) but hardly ever prior to LC-MS-based detection, and here we describe some applications, opportunities, and challenges of corresponding workflows.

### Sample Protocol
Various protocols described in supporting information of article entitled "Adsorptive microtiter plates as solid supports in affinity purification workflows".

### Data Protocol
DDA data were processed using PEAKS Studio software (version 8.5), and peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB homo sapiens ‘UP000005640’ reference proteome (canonical; 40,742 entries; downloaded on August 6, 2018). Trypsin was selected as protease (≤3 missed cleavages), cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. Up to 6 modifications per peptide, ≤10.0 ppm precursor mass deviation (using monoisotopic mass), ≤0.02 Da fragment ion mass deviation, and ≤0.1% false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), peptides, and proteins were allowed, and at least one unique peptide was required for protein identification.

### Publication Abstract
Affinity ligands such as antibodies are widely used in (bio)medical research for purifying proteins from complex biological samples. These ligands are generally immobilized onto solid supports which facilitate the separation of a captured protein from the sample matrix. Adsorptive microtiter plates are commonly used as solid supports prior to immunochemical detection (e.g., immunoassays) but hardly ever prior to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-)-based detection. Here, we describe the use of adsorptive microtiter plates for protein enrichment prior to LC-MS detection, and we discuss opportunities and challenges of corresponding workflows, based on examples of targeted (i.e., soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) in human serum) and discovery-based workflows (i.e., transcription factor p65 (NF-&#x3ba;B) in lysed murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5 (FKBP5) in lysed human A549 alveolar basal epithelial cells). Thereby, we aim to highlight the potential usefulness of adsorptive microtiter plates in affinity purification workflows prior to LC-MS detection, which could increase their usage in mass spectrometry-based protein research.
