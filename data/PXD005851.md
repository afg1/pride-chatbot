### Title
Acetylation of Diverse Bacteria

### Description
We sampled global bottom up proteomics data from 48 diverse bacteria and searched for sites of lysine acetylation. Bacteria came from 6 phyla: proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, and fibrobacteres.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline
