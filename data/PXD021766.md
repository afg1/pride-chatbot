### Title
Proteome of testicular extracellular vesicles

### Description
We have isolated highly pure testicular extracellular vesicles using a newly established testis dissociation method. We then used shotgun proteomic approach to examine the proteins carried by and expressed on the testicular extracellular vesicles.

### Sample Protocol
Protein were extracted from testicular extracellular vesicles. Samples were subjected to filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). The samples were fun in Chromxp C18 column using Triple TOF 6600 system (SCIEX).

### Data Protocol
The raw data was analyzed in PEAKS Studio 8.5. Protein query was performed in Uniprot database. The mass tolerance of the primary mass spectrum is 20 ppm and 30 ppm, and of the secondary mass spectrium is 0.1Da.
