### Title
Host proteins interacting with T. gondii Mitochondrial Association Factor 1

### Description
This is a quantitative mass spectrometry experiment to identify host proteins that associate with the T. gondii effector protein MAF1b, which drives the association between the T. gondii vacuole and host mitochondria

### Sample Protocol
Samples were collected and immunoprecipitated using magnetic beads coupled to anti HA antibodies.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified by searching against the GenPept Database

### Publication Abstract
None
