### Title
Proteomic data of the Trypanosoma cruzi RNA-binding protein UBP1 induction and knockdown in insect-dwelling epimastigotes

### Description
We used a system based on the Tetracycline-inducible expression of the U-rich RNA-binding protein 1 (TcUBP1) and performed CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of TcUBP1 to monitor proteome changes in Trypanosoma cruzi cells expressing different levels of the protein.

### Sample Protocol
This data file describes the biological analysis of three distinct proteomic samples: WT (wiltype), UBP1-KD (UBP1 knockdown), and UBP1-OE (UBP1 overexpression), with three biological replicates each, higlighting differential protein abundances.

### Data Protocol
The obtained spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer program, utilizing the database specific to the Trypanosoma cruzi (strain CL Brener) UP000002296.
