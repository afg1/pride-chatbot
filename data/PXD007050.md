### Title
Mature B cell homeostasis, B cell activation and antibody response require protein O-GlcNAcylation

### Description
Proteins identified in sWGA versus anti-IgM pull-down assay.

### Sample Protocol
Collected proteins from mouse splenic B cells stimulated with anti-IgM and sWGA lectin purification. After SDS-PAGE separation, the whole lane was cut into 8 pieces for comprehensive protein profilling.

### Data Protocol
Mascot (ver. 2.5) for MS/MS analysis based on SwissProt Mouse protein database.
