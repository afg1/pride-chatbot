### Title
A pancreatic cancer cells spectral library and the phenotype analysis of gemcitabine-sensitive and -resistant pancreatic cell lines by the data-independent acquisition proteome strategy

### Description
Based on data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS) strategies for in-depth proteome analysis, we established a high-coverage spectrum library from seven human pancreatic cell lines and evaluated performance of the library by exploring the molecular change between gemcitabine (GEM) sensitivity and resistance phenotypes .

### Sample Protocol
Seven commonly used human pancreatic cell lines were selected to generate the spectral library: the pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, HPAC, and PANC-1; human pancreatic stellate cells HPaSteC (HPSC); and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells HPDE6-C7 (H6C7).

### Data Protocol
Eighty-four original MS data files were obtained from the pre-fractioned peptide by basic reversed-phase chromatography. We analyzed the proteomics of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells before and after GEM treatment using DIA strategy based on the spectrum library. The Cell Counting Kit-8 cytotoxicity test combined with proteomics data analyzed the GEM sensitivity and drug resistance phenotypes.
