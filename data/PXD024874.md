### Title
DOT1L AP-MS in human K562 cells to characterize its associated proteins

### Description
we performed large-scale co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using a DOT1L antibody with nuclear extract from K562 cells, and characterized immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
we performed large-scale co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using a IgG/DOT1L antibody with nuclear extract from K562 cells followed by mass spectrometry analyses.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were searched using MASCOT engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.2) against the Human UniProt database (downloaded at May 2019; 171145 sequences). For protein identification, the following options were used: Peptide mass tolerance=20 ppm, MS/MS tolerance=0.1 Da, Enzyme=Trypsin, Missed cleavage=2, Fixed modification: Carbamidomethyl (C), Variable modification: Oxidation(M) ; score > 20.
