### Title
Analysis of  the Byssus of Chinese Green Mussel proteomics by LC-MS/MS

### Description
Here, we integrated high-throughput transcriptome and proteome sequencing to construct a comprehensive protein database for the byssus of Chinese green mussel (Perna viridis), aiming at providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of byssal binding to heavy metals.

### Sample Protocol
Fresh specimens of P. viridis (6-8 cm in the shell length) were collected from a local market in Yantian District, Shenzhen, China (Latitude 22˚35’ N and Longitude 114˚17’ E). The foot area (near the foot gland; Figure 1a) was collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80℃. Total RNA of each sample was extracted using RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA samples, treated with RNase-Free DNase I (Thermo, USA) to eliminate genomic DNAs, were subsequently used to construct a cDNA library for further transcriptome sequencing. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board on Bioethics and Biosafety of BGI, China.

### Data Protocol
Acquired MS data were converted to MGF files by Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the exported MGF files were searched using Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience; London, UK) against the byssal transcriptome-annotated database (see more details in the section 4.2.). Mascot parameters were set as follows: Trypsin was selected as the specific enzyme with a maximum of one missed cleavages permitted per peptide; fixed modifications of Carbamidomethyl(C); variable modifications consisting of Oxidation (M),Deamidatioin (N, Q) and Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q); peptide charge, 2+, 3+, and 4+; 20 ppm of peptide mass tolerance; 0.05 Da of fragment mass tolerance.
