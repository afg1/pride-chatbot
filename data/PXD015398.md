### Title
Impact of abacavir and abacavir analogues on HLA-B*57:01 peptide presentation

### Description
Characterisation of peptide ligands of the Major histocompatibility class (MHC) I allele, HLA-B*57:01, expressed in the C1R (Class I reduced) B-lymphoblastoid cell line, after exposure to the anti-retroviral abacavir or abacavir analogues.

### Sample Protocol
Snap frozen cell pellets of 4-5x10^8 cells were lysed by mechanical and detergent based lysis, the lysates cleared by ultracentrifugation, HLA class I complexes isolated by immunoaffinity purification using solid-phase bound pan class I antibody W6/32. Complexes were dissociated using 10 % acetic acid and fractionated by RP-HPLC. Peptide-containing fractions were vacuum concentrated, pooled into 9-12 pools, and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid. Reconstituted fraction pools were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) via a data dependent acquisition strategy using a NanoUltra cHiPLC system (Eksigent) coupled to an SCIEX 5600+ TripleTOF mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray III ion source.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were searched against the reviewed human proteome (UniProt/Swiss-Prot accessed November 2017) using ProteinPilot™ software (version 5.0, SCIEX) using the following settings: Sample Type - Identification, Cys. Alkylation - None, Digestion - None, Instrument - TripleTOF 5600, ID Focus - Biological modifications, Search Effort – Thorough, FDR Analysis – Yes.
