### Title
Investigating HMGB1 as a Potential Serum Biomarker for Early Diabetic Nephropathy Monitoring by Quantitative Proteomics

### Description
Current diagnostic methods for diabetic nephropathy (DN) lack precision, especially in early stages and monitoring progression. This study aims to find potential biomarkers for DN progression and evaluate their accuracy. Using serum samples from healthy controls (NC), diabetic patients (DM), early-medium stage DN (DN-EM), and late-stage DN (DN-L), researchers employed quantitative proteomics and Mfuzz clustering analysis revealed 15 proteins showing increased expression during DN progression, hinting at their biomarker potential. Combining Mfuzz clustering with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted five candidates (HMGB1, CD44, FBLN1, PTPRG, and ADAMTSL4). HMGB1 emerged as a promising biomarker, closely correlated with renal function changes. Experimental validation supported HMGB1’s upregulation under high glucose conditions, reinforcing its potential as an early detection biomarker for DN. This research advances DN understanding and identifies five potential biomarkers, notably HMGB1, as a promising early monitoring target. These findings set the stage for future clinical diagnostic applications in DN.

### Sample Protocol
Serum samples from fasting blood were collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and stored at − 80 °C until assayed. The cell debris was removed by centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, then depleted of high-abundance proteins using the Pierce™ Top 12 Abundant Protein Depletion Spin Columns Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 85164) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentration was determined using BCA kit (Beyotime, P0011).  An equivalent quantity of protein was utilized for enzymatic hydrolysis in every sample. The volume was standardized, and subsequently, dithiothreitol (DTT) was introduced to achieve a final concentration of 5 mM. This mixture was then subjected to reduction at 56°C for a duration of 30 minutes. Subsequent to that, iodoacetamide (IAA) was incorporated to attain a final concentration of 11 mM. This concoction was left to incubate in darkness for a duration of 15 minutes at room temperature. Afterward, the samples were carefully transferred into ultrafiltration tubes and subjected to centrifugation at 12000 g for a span of 20 minutes, all at room temperature. Following this centrifugation step, the samples underwent a thorough washing process, involving three successive washes with 8M urea, followed by an additional three rounds of washing with the replacement buffer. In the final step, trypsin was incorporated at a proportion of 1:50 (trypsin to protein, m/m) to facilitate an overnight digestion process. Following centrifugation at 12000 g for a duration of 10 minutes at room temperature to recover the peptides, they were also recovered using ultrapure water once and then mixed together. For the examination of serum samples, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach was employed. This involved utilizing an Orbitrap Exploris™ 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in tandem with an EASY-nLC 1200 Ultra high-performance liquid phase system (UHPLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometry was used to analyze the ionized peptides after they had been separated by the UHPLC and introduced into the NSI ion source for ionization. Mass spectrometry was set for primary scan range of 400-1200 m/z, at 60000 resolution; secondary scan range of 100 m/z, at 30000 resolution, without TurboTMT. Data-dependent scanning (DDA) software was utilized in the data collecting mode. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 75% to maximize the effective use of the mass spectrum. The signal threshold was defined at 1E4 ions/s, with a maximum injection time of 100ms. Additionally, a dynamic exclusion time of 30s was applied to tandem mass spectrometry scans to ensure avoidance of duplicate scanning for parent ions.
