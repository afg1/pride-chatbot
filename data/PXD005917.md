### Title
Arabidopsis katanin mutants LC-MSMS

### Description
Shot-gun proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis katanin mutants reveals new processes occurring downstream of microtubule severing

### Sample Protocol
For proteomic and immunoblotting analyses, 14 days old seedlings of ktn1-2, fra2 mutants and Col-0 (in four biological replicates) were used.

### Data Protocol
The raw files were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm of the Proteome Discoverer software.

### Publication Abstract
Microtubule organization and dynamics are critical for key developmental processes such as cell division, elongation, and morphogenesis. Microtubule severing is an essential regulator of microtubules and is exclusively executed by KATANIN 1 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> In this study, we comparatively studied the proteome-wide effects in two <i>KATANIN 1</i> mutants. Thus, shotgun proteomic analysis of roots and aerial parts of single nucleotide mutant <i>fra2</i> and T-DNA insertion mutant <i>ktn1-2</i> was carried out. We have detected 42 proteins differentially abundant in both <i>fra2</i> and <i>ktn1-2</i> KATANIN 1 dysfunction altered the abundance of proteins involved in development, metabolism, and stress responses. The differential regulation of tubulins and microtubule-destabilizing protein MDP25 implied a feedback microtubule control in <i>KATANIN 1</i> mutants. Furthermore, deregulation of profilin 1, actin-depolymerizing factor 3, and actin 7 was observed. These findings were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis of actin and by microscopic observation of actin filaments using fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Results obtained by quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that changed protein abundances were not a consequence of altered expression levels of corresponding genes in the mutants. In conclusion, we show that abundances of several cytoskeletal proteins as well as organization of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton are amended in accordance with defective microtubule severing.
