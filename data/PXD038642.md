### Title
The HAPSTR2 retrogene buffers stress signaling and resilience in mammals

### Description
Standard anti-FLAG magnetic beads for co-immunoprecipitations, elution in 2x SDS sample buffer, loaded into a stacking gel and then in-gel digested

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified from the MS raw files using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK. version 2.5.1). MS/MS spectra were searched against the SwissProt huam database. All searches included carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidized Methionine, deamidated asparagine and aspartic Acid, and acetylated N-term as variable modifications. Three missed tryptic cleavages were allowed. A 1% false discovery rate cutoff was applied at the peptide level. Only proteins with a minimum of two peptides above the cutoff were considered for further study. Identified peptides/protein were visualized by Scaffold software (version 5.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR

### Publication Abstract
We recently identified HAPSTR1 (C16orf72) as a key component in a novel pathway which regulates the cellular response to molecular stressors, such as DNA damage, nutrient scarcity, and protein misfolding. Here, we identify a functional paralog to HAPSTR1: HAPSTR2. HAPSTR2 formed early in mammalian evolution, via genomic integration of a reverse transcribed HAPSTR1 transcript, and has since been preserved under purifying selection. HAPSTR2, expressed primarily in neural and germline tissues and a subset of cancers, retains established biochemical features of HAPSTR1 to achieve two functions. In normal physiology, HAPSTR2 directly interacts with HAPSTR1, markedly augmenting HAPSTR1 protein stability in a manner independent from HAPSTR1's canonical E3 ligase, HUWE1. Alternatively, in the context of HAPSTR1 loss, HAPSTR2 expression is sufficient to buffer stress signaling and resilience. Thus, we discover a mammalian retrogene which safeguards fitness.
