### Title
Acetylomics data of the Anti-Proliferative Activity of Safranal on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell

### Description
We conducted a combining isobaric tag-based TMT labeling followed by enrichment of lysine acetylated peptides by Acetyl-Lysine Immunoprecipitation (IP) method as Acetylomics study on MDA-MB-231 treated with safranal.

### Sample Protocol
A total of 2×106 MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Safranal and collected in three different time points of 30min, 12h and 24h with three replicates in each time point. Moreover, the cells were incubated 12h with the cell culture medium containing 0.15% DMSO in two replicates as control conditions. The cells were lysed in 250 µL lysis buffer (1% SDC, 5 mM TCEP) by probe sonicating in 2 cycles of 10 seconds at 60% amplitude. Proteins were digested using Trypsin and Lys-C and peptides were labeled with the TMT 11 plex kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The acetylated peptides were enriched using PTMScan ® Acetyl-Lysine Motif [Ac-K] Immunoaffinity Beads.

### Data Protocol
peptides identification was performed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4.0.305 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The search was performed against the Swissprot Homo sapiens database using in-house Mascot server (version 2.6). Search parameters were set to false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for proteins and peptides, fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da and precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm. The acetylated peptides search included the parameters:Maximum missed cleavages of the acetylated peptides search were set on 4 and we also set the TMT6plex (K), Acetylation (K) as dynamic modifications and TMT6plex (N-term), Carbamidomethyl (C) as static modifications. All datasets from PD were exported to Excel (Microsoft) for further processes.
