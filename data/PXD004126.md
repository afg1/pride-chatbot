### Title
Proteomics needs better chromatography

### Description
Examination of relationship between chromatographic peak capacity and MS/MS scan rate.

### Sample Protocol
Entire yeast proteome was digested with trypsin, separated over a 90 minute gradient, and analyzed using different MS/MS scan rates.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant with default settings and advance “Calculate peak properties” option selected.

### Publication Abstract
From plant research to biomedicine, proteome analysis plays a critical role in many areas of biological inquiry. Steady improvement in mass spectrometer (MS) technology has transformed the speed and depth of proteome analysis. Proteomes of simple organisms can now be sequenced to near completion in just over an hour. Comparable coverage of mammalian proteomes, however, still requires hours or even days of analysis. Here we ask why current technology fails to achieve comprehensive and rapid analysis of the more complex mammalian proteomes. We propose that further advancements in MS technology alone are unlikely to solve this problem and suggest that concomitant improvements in peptide separation technology will be critical.
