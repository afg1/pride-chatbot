### Title
Human in vitro proteome - To establish a platform for genome-wide targeted proteomics, we synthesized 18040 recombinant proteins (in vitro proteome) from human full-length cDNA libraries. Obtained proteins were digested with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Description
To establish a platform for genome-wide targeted proteomics, we synthesized 18040 recombinant proteins (in vitro proteome) from human full-length cDNA libraries. Obtained proteins were digested with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
A total of 18,040 Gateway entry clones were selected from HuPEX (Human Proteome Expression resource) and ORFeome which is the Gateway entry clone set harboring the ORF of cDNAs for producing proteins. In vitro translation was performed by mixing the mRNA with wheat germ extract WEPRO7240 (CellFree Sciences, Co., Ltd., Japan). To obtain peptides mixture for mass spectrometry, typically 96 proteins were mixed and purified. Resulting protein mixture were digested with trypsin and labeled with mTRAQd4. Each peptide mixture was analyzed by TripleTOF5600 instrument.

### Data Protocol
Peak lists (mgf) were obtained by using AB SCIEX MS Data Converter. MASCOT search was performed against in house protein sequence database containing FLJ, ORFeome, and wheat germ proteins concatenated with reverse decoy sequeces (81,480 entries) with following parameter settings: Trypsin was selected as enzyme used, allowed number of missed cleavages was set 2 and mTRAQï�„4-label on NH2-terminus/Lys, carbamidomethylation on Cys were selected as fixed modification. Oxidized methionine and mTRAQï�„4-label on Tyr were searched as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerances were 50 ppm and tolerance of MS/MS ions was 0.02 Da.
