### Title
Proteomic in Extracellular Vesicles produced by T-ALL and B-ALL cells

### Description
The goal of the project was to discover proteines expressed in Extracellular Vesicles secreted by T-ALL or B-ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) cancer cells, when cells were amplified in vivo in Patient Derived Xenotransplanted (PDX) mice.

### Sample Protocol
BM cells were recovered from PDX mice developing ALL leukemia, bones were crushed in PBS1X and filtrated. Extracellular Vesicles were purified following Extracellular Vesicles purification procedure.

### Data Protocol
Pre-analytic (gel 1D, protein extraction, precipitation, purification, protein dosage), nanoLC-MS/MS (Orbitrap)

### Publication Abstract
None

### Keywords
