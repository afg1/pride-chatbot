### Title
Label-free proteomics reveal that plasma protein expression differs between colorectal cancer patients according to tumor stage, location, patient survival, preoperative radiotherapy status, or gender.

### Description
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and is a heterogeneous disease, with differences between cancer in the right colon, left colon, and rectum. In this study, plasma samples from CRC patients with varying stage (II or III), primary tumor location (right colon, left colon, or rectum) and survival (survived or died due to CRC) were studied with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MSE. Patients were also divided into subgroups based on preoperative radiotherapy status and gender. Further analysis subsequently identified multiple plasma proteins whose expression differed depending on tumor stage, location, patient survival, preoperative radiotherapy status, or gender.

### Sample Protocol
Plasma samples were Top 12 protein depleted, reduced, alkylated, digested and run into Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer in UDMSE-mode.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were imported to Progenesis QIP with lock mass correction, aligned and normalized to the Hi3 internal standard.
