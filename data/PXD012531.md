### Title
The yeast AIF homolog Nde1 integrates metabolic and proteostatic signals on the mitochondrial surface and executes cell death

### Description
Little is known about the proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins under static growth conditions. Combining dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry in yeast cells, we found an exceptionally high turnover for the NADH dehydrogenase Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor AIF forms two distinct topomers in mitochondria, one residing in the intermembrane space and one cytosol-exposed form that spans the outer membrane. The latter serves as pro-apoptotic factortrigger of cell death with the potential to kill yeast cells in response pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is strongly enriched in respiratory deficient cells and its turnover is executed cooperatively by the cytosolic proteasome and the mitochondrial protease Yme1. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised individuals from growing cell populations.

### Sample Protocol
Wild type yeast YPH499 (auxotrophic for arginine and lysine) was grown in synthetic lactate medium containing light arginine and lysine. When the culture was in mid-logarithmic growth phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with medium without amino acids and resuspended in medium containing heavy arginine (Arg10) and lysine (Lys8). At indicated time points, samples were drawn, harvested by centrifugation, snap froyen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C. After all samples were taken, mitochondria were isolated as described.  Mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis was performed basically as described by Hammel et al. (2018)  with minor modifications. In brief, proteins were digested in solution and desalted on home made STAGE-tips. For peptide LC-MS/MS analysis, a nano-LC 425 HPLC coupled to a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (Eksigent and ABSciex) was employed, but using a longer (68 min) gradient for separation. Data were acquired using one MS survey scan (350 - 1400 m/z, 250 ms accumulation time) triggering 30 MS/MS scans (100 â€“ 1500 m/z, 50 ms accumulation time, rolling collision energy) on the most intense precursors with an intensity >300 cps resulting in a 1.8 s cycle time. After MS/MS analysis, the selected precursors were excluded for 12 s from analysis.

### Data Protocol
Acquired data were analyzed using MaxQuant 1.5.8.3 using a reverse UniProt FASTA Saccharomyces cerevisiae database (UP000002311) including common contaminants. The following modifications were taken into account: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (N-term, variable), Oxidation (M, variable) and Arg10 and Lys8 as SILAC labels for quantification. MaxQuant standard settings were used for mass tolerances. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. A minimum of 2 unique peptides with a peptide length of at least seven amino acids and a false discovery rate below 0.01 were required on the peptide and protein level.

### Publication Abstract
The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in mitochondria, one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised cells from growing populations.
