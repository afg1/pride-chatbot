### Title
TMT Screening of Human Samples:SiHa cell

### Description
A screen for APOA1 downstream proteins affecting platinum-based chemoresistance using Tandem Mass Tag revealed 64 differentially expressed proteins in SiHa cells, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, subcellular localization, structural domain annotation and enrichment, clustering, and interaction network analyses

### Sample Protocol
He Yue: A screen for APOA1 downstream proteins affecting platinum-based chemoresistance using Tandem Mass Tag revealed 64 differentially expressed proteins in SiHa cells, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, subcellular localization, structural domain annotation and enrichment, clustering, and interaction network analyses  He Yue: We chose the common squamous cervical cell type SiHa cells for further tests. The samples were divided into four group (OE, NCï¼ŒNC+CBP and OE+CBP), four group labeled with different isotopes and three independent trials were conducted. The types of isotope used in the analysis were following: NC1-126, NC2-127N, NC3-127C, NC+CBP1-128N, NC+CBP2-128C, NC+CBP3-131N, OE1-131C, OE2-132N, OE3-132C, OE+CBP1-133N, OE+CBP2-133C, OE+CBP3-134N.

### Data Protocol
Biological analyses included Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis (http://geneontology.org/), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation and enrichment analysis, subcellular localization analysis, domain annotation and enrichment analysis, and clustering and interaction network analysis.
