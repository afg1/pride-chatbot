### Title
Quantitative and dynamic catalogs of proteins released during apoptotic and necroptotic cell death

### Description
The inflammatory functions of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rely on its ability to induce cytokine production and to induce cell death. Caspase dependent and independent pathways Ã¢â‚¬â€œ apoptosis and necroptosis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ respectively, regulate immunogenicity by the release of distinct sets of cellular proteins. To obtain an unbiased, systems-level understanding of this important process, we here applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to dissect protein release during apoptosis and necroptosis. We report hundreds of proteins released from human myeloid cells in time-course experiments. Both cell death types induce receptor shedding, but only apoptotic cells released nucleosome components. Conversely, necroptotic cells release lysosomal components by activating lysosomal exocytosis at early stages of necroptosis- induced membrane permeabilisation and show reduced release of conventionally secreted cytokines.

### Sample Protocol
Supernatants were spun for 5 minutes at 500 x g to remove cells and filtered through 0.22 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµm filters to remove cell debris. Addition of 8 M Urea in 40 mM Hepes to bring the sample to a final concentration of 2.7 M Urea was followed by sonication (Biorupter) for 20 minutes. Proteins were reduced by addition of 10 mM DTT followed by a 30 minutes incubation at room temperature. Proteins were alkylated by addition of 55 mM Iodoacetamide followed by a 20 minutes incubation at room temperature in the dark. 100 mM Thiourea were added before addition of 1 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµg LysC and Trypsin and digestion over night at room temperature. Enzyme activity was stopped by addition of 2% ACN and 0.6% TFA and proteins were cleaned up on C18 StageTips.

### Data Protocol
MS raw files were processed by the MaxQuant software version 1.5.0.38 (Cox and Mann, 2008) and fragments lists were searched against the human Uniprot Reference Proteome without isoforms (August 2015) by the Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011). All bioinformatics analyses were done with the Perseus software (version 1.5.3.0) (Tyanova, 2016) of the MaxQuant computational platform.
