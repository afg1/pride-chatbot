### Title
Identification of myelin basic protein interactome using TurboID proximity labeling proteomics

### Description
The protein environment of myelin basic protein (MBP), its uncharged form, and cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21Cip1) were analyzed using two different approaches to identify protein partners thereof. The first one was a state-of-the-art enzymatic approach (TurboID), which utilizes an engineered biotin ligase that uses ATP to convert biotin to reactive biotin-AMP that covalently attaches to nearby proteins, followed by enrichment of biotin-labeled proteins on streptavidin beads and MS analysis of the resulting protein pool. Classical immunoprecipitation with Flag-tag fused to the target protein in combination with MS analysis was used as a reference method. As a result, two pools of potential interactors of MBP and uncharged MBP were identified. It was shown that TurboID, although giving a high level of background biotinylation, is a more reproducible technique compared to the immunoprecipitation, possibly due to higher affinity during the fraction enrichment process and easier maintaining of uniform conditions for the process, as well as interaction conditions being closer to in vivo conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Cells and Transfection HEK 293T cells were obtained from the Russian Cell Culture Collection (RCCC, In-stitute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St-Petersburg, Russia). HEK 293T cells were maintained by passage in Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagleâ€™s medium supplemented with 100 Î¼g/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (pH 7.2â€“7.4) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. HEK293T cells were transfected with the MBP_Flag_TurboID, MBPCit_Flag_TurboID, p21_Flag_TurboID and Flag_TurboID (as negative control) expression plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with PLUS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. All the labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted at 48 h after transfection. Proximity labeling in mammalian cells with TurboID and preparation of proteomic samples Fresh HEK293T cells were plated on 6-well plates pre-coated with human fibronectin and grown to confluence. The cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 3000TM reagent with the appropriate fusion constructs carrying MBP_Flag_TurboID, MBP-Cit_Flag_TurboID, and p21_Flag_TurboID and Flag_TurboID control construct. After 24 hours, the medium was changed to a new with 50Î¼M biotin. The reaction was stopped after 30 minutes of labeling by washing with ice-cold PBS. Next, the cells pellets were lysed using RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13000g for 20 minutes at 4Â°C. The supernatant was incubated with Streptavidinâ€“agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) resin (pre-washed with RIPA buffer) overnight at 4Â°C with constant rotation. Next, the resin was centrifuged at 2000g for 2 minutes at 4Â°C. The resin was washed twice with 1ml of RIPA buffer, once with 1 ml of 1M KCl (incubation for 2 minutes at RT), then once with 0.1 M Na2CO3 (incubation for 10 seconds at RT), then twice in a buffer containing 10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 2M (incubation for 10 seconds at RT) and, finally, washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The supernatant was removed, and the resin was resuspended in 100 Âµl of 1x Sample buffer with 2mM biotin and 20mM DTT. Finally, the samples were heated for 10 minutes at 95C. Immunoprecipitation The cleared lysates were incubated with 20 Î¼L of anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sig-ma-Aldrich, USA) or Pierce Protein A/G Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) slurry at 4 Â°C for overnight. Following incubation, agarose beads with immu-nocomplexes were washed with TNE buffer five times, and immunocomplexes were eluted from agarose beads with sample buffer (65.8 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue) at 65 Â°C for 5 min. The supernatants were treated with 5 Î¼L of 2-mercaptoethanol at 95 Â°C for 5 min. Supernatants containing immunocomplexes were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and obtained gels were stained using Coomassie blue. Mass Spectrometry Analysis The strips from the bands stained by Coomassie blue were excised and subjected to a trypsin in-gel digestion procedure. After overnight tryptic digestion, the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel blocks. Samples were loaded to in house-made trap column (20 Ã— 0.1 mm), packed with Inertsil ODS3 3 Î¼M sorbent (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), in the loading mobile phase (2% acetonitrile (ACN), 98% H2O, 0.1% TFA) at flow rate 10 Î¼L/min and separated in a in house-made fused-silica column (300 Ã— 0.1 mm) packed with Reprosil PUR C18AQ 1.9 at RT into an emitter made using P2000 Laser Puller. Re-verse-phase chromatography was performed using an Ultimate 3000 Nano LC System, which was connected to the Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer via a nanoelectrospray source. As mobile phase A, water containing 0.1% (v/v) formamide was used and, as mobile phase B, acetonitrile containing 0.1% formamide (v/v), 20% water (v/v) was used. Peptides were eluted from the trap column with a linear gradient: 3â€“6% of B for 3 min; 6â€“25% of B for 30 min, 25â€“40% of B for 25 min, 40â€“60% of B for 4 min, 60% of B for 3 min, 60â€“99% of B for 0.1 min, 99% B during 10 min, 99â€“2%B for 0.1 min at 500 nL/min flow rate. After each gradient run, the column was preequilibrated with the buffer A for 10 min. MS data was collected in DDA mode. MS1 parameters were the following: resolutionâ€”70 K, scan rangeâ€”350â€“1500, max injection timeâ€”30 s, AGC targetâ€”3 Ã— 106. Ions were isolated with 1.4 m/z window, preferred peptide match and isotope exclusion. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s. MS2 fragmentation was performed in HCD mode at 17.5 K resolution with normalized colli-sion energy (NCE) of 29%, max injection time of 50 s, AGC targetâ€”2 Ã— 105, loop countâ€”10. Other settings were the following: charge exclusionâ€”unassigned, 1, >7.

### Data Protocol
Raw LC-MS/MS data from the Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer were converted to mgf peak lists with MSConvert software (ProteoWizard Software Foundation). The following parameters were used for this procedure, â€œ--mgf --filter peakPicking true [1,2]â€�. For an exhaustive protein identification, obtained peak lists were processed by MASCOT (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) and X! Tandem (ALANINE, 2017.02.01, The Global Proteome Machine Organization) against the UniProt Knowledgebase, taxon human, (http://www.uniprot.org, 12.05.2021) with the concatenated reverse decoy dataset. The precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set at 20 ppm and 50 ppm, respectively. The database search parameters were settled as follows: tryptic digestion with one possible missed cleavage, static modification for car-bamidomethyl (C), and dynamic/flexible modifications for oxidation (M) and biotinylation (K or N-terminal). Selected parameters for X! Tandem allowed to rapidly detect protein N-terminal acetylation, peptide N-terminal glutamine ammonia loss or peptide N-terminal glutamic acid water loss. The resulting files were subjected to Scaffold 5 (version 5.1.0, Proteome Software Inc, Portland, OR, USA) for validation and further analysis.
