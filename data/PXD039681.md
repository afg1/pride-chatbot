### Title
Peptide and MUC5B hydrolysis by the Mucin Degrading Protease (MdpL) from Limosilactobacillus fermentum

### Description
MUC5B is the predominant glycoprotein in saliva and is instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of multi-species eubiotic biofilms in the oral cavity. Investigations of the aciduric Lactobacillaceae family, and its role in biofilms emphasizes the diversity across different genera of the proteolytic systems involved in the nutritional utilization of mucins. We have characterized a cysteine protease from Limosilactobacillus fermentum, MdpL (Mucin degrading protease from Limosilactobacillus) with a high protein backbone similarity with commensals that exploit mucins for attachment and nutrition. MdpL was shown to be associated with the bacterial cell surface, in close proximity to MUC5B, which was sequentially degraded into low molecular weight fragments. Mapping the substrate preference revealed multiple hydrolytic sites of proteins with a high O-glycan occurrence, although hydrolysis was not dependent on the presence of O-glycans. However, since proteolysis of immunoglobulins was absent, and general protease activity was low, a preference for glycoproteins similar to MUC5B in terms of glycosylation and structure is suggested. MdpL preferentially hydrolyzed C-terminally located hydrophobic residues in peptides larger than 20 amino acids, which hinted at a limited sequence preference. To secure proper enzyme folding and optimal conditions for activity, L. fermentum incorporates a complex system that establishes a reducing environment. The importance of overall reducing conditions was confirmed by the activity boosting effect of the added reducing agents L-cysteine and DTT. High activity was retained in low to neutral pH 5.5-7.0, but the enzyme was completely inhibited in the presence of Zn2+. Here we have characterized a highly conserved mucin degrading protease from L. fermentum. MdpL, that together with the recently discovered O-glycanase and O-glycoprotease enzyme groups, increases our understanding of mucin degradation and complex biofilm dynamics.

### Sample Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis of peptide hydrolysis The peptides Neuromedin U-25, MOG (Bachem, Switzerland), and Insulin Chain B Oxidized (IOB) (Sigma, United States) were incubated with MdpL (18 h, 37 C) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, with 20 mM L-cys to detect any preferential sites permitting MdpL hydrolysis.  LC-MS/MS analysis of MUC5B degradation Human MUC5B purified from whole saliva as previously described (Wickström and Svensäter, 2008) was incubated with MdpL (20 h, 37 C) and 20 mM L-cys in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The enzyme was inhibited using 2 mM Zn2+, before running the sample over an Immobilized PNGase-F column (Genovis AB). The sample was incubated with Lys-C (Thermo Scientific) in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 (5% SDS) (18 h, 37 C)

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis of peptide hydrolysis Fragments were separated using LC (Agilent Technologies 1290 Infinity, C18) and analyzed by MS/MS (Bruker Impact II). MdpL hydrolysis sites were mapped using the Bruker Compass Data Analysis 5.2 and BioPharma Compass 4.0 software. A sequence logo (WebLogo 3, University of Berkeley) illustrating the most occurring amino acid +/– three positions from the MdpL hydrolytic site was created by entering the 89 detected high score (>30) peptides generated from the hydrolysis of Neuromedin U-25, MOG, and Insulin Chain B Oxidized.  LC-MS/MS analysis of MUC5B degradation The fragments were separated using LC (Evosep ONE, nano-UHPLC, C18), and analyzed by MS/MS (Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadropole-Orbitrap). The MdpL digestion sites were mapped using Xcalibur 4.1 (Thermo Scientific) for data acquisition and MaxQuant 1.6 (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Germany) for data analysis.

MUC5B is the predominant glycoprotein in saliva and is instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of multi-species eubiotic biofilms in the oral cavity. Investigations of the aciduric <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> family, and its role in biofilms emphasizes the diversity across different genera of the proteolytic systems involved in the nutritional utilization of mucins. We have characterized a protease from <i>Limosilactobacillus fermentum</i>, MdpL (Mucin degrading protease from <i>Limosilactobacillus</i>) with a high protein backbone similarity with commensals that exploit mucins for attachment and nutrition. MdpL was shown to be associated with the bacterial cell surface, in close proximity to MUC5B, which was sequentially degraded into low molecular weight fragments.
