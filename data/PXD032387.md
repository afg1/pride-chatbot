### Title
Metaproteomic profiling of the intestinal microbiota of the participants of the AGBRESA study

### Description
Application of a mass spectrometry -based approach to assess the gut microbiota composition and the associated metaproteomic functionality of subjects exposed to simulated microgravityduring the Artificial Gravity Bed Rest study (AGBRESA)

### Sample Protocol
Following precipitation of the proteins with chloroform-methanol, protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were assigned to taxa using in house scripts using NCBI references, with spectral counts as taxon abundance proxy.

### Publication Abstract
The Artificial Gravity Bed Rest - European Space Agency (AGBRESA) study was the first joint bed rest study by ESA, DLR, and NASA that examined the effect of simulated weightlessness on the human body and assessed the potential benefits of artificial gravity as a countermeasure in an analog of long-duration spaceflight. In this study, we investigated the impact of simulated microgravity on the gut microbiome of 12 participants during a 60-day head-down tilt bed rest at the :envihab facilities. Over 60&#x2009;days of simulated microgravity resulted in a mild change in the gut microbiome, with distinct microbial patterns and pathway expression in the feces of the countermeasure group compared to the microgravity simulation-only group. Additionally, we found that the countermeasure protocols selectively increased the abundance of beneficial short-chain fatty acids in the gut, such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Some physiological signatures also included the modulation of taxa reported to be either beneficial or opportunistic, indicating a mild adaptation in the microbiome network balance. Our results suggest that monitoring the gut microbial catalog along with pathway clustering and metabolite profiling is an informative synergistic strategy to determine health disturbances and the outcome of countermeasure protocols for future space missions.
