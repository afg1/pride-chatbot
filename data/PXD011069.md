### Title
RawTools Parsing of Orbitrap Raw Data Files -Quality control analysis

### Description
RawTools is a software that provides parsing and quantification of raw Thermo Orbitrap mass spectrometer data. RawTools software was used to process a set of injections (n = 140) from a prepared HeLa digest that were analyzed on an Orbitrap Velos to get summarized instrument performance metrics for quality control.

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cell pellets were processed using a guanidinium lysis with bead-based disruption using a FastPrep instrument. Proteins were digested using trypsin, and cleaned up using standard C18 approaches. Peptide samples were analyzed using a low micro-flow chromatography approach on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using a RawTools. Search files were generated on-the-fly by IdentiPy.
