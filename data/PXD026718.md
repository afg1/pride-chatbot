### Title
APEX-Gal1 Labeled C2C12 Myoblasts

### Description
Myogenic differentiation is influenced by interactions at the cell surface involving the glycan binding protein galectin-1. Using a proximity labeling galectin-1 construct, we biotinylated and enriched galectin-1 interactors in mouse myoblasts, and analyzed them by LC/MS/MS to determine relevant galectin-1 interactors.

### Sample Protocol
2mg/ml cell lysate was precipitated overnight in methanol and dissolved in Urea. Dissolved proteins were reduced in TCEP before free thiols were alkylated with iodoacetamide. Biotinylated proteins were enriched on streptavidin beads, and digested in proteomics grade trypsin. Samples were labeled with TMT reagents and combined for injection. Samples were analyzed on a Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer from an EASY PepMapTM RSLC C18 column.

### Data Protocol
Peptide sequences were determined by matching protein databases with fragmention patterns by SEQEST HT algorithm. Spectra were searched against the mus musculus proteome database with a target false discovery rate of 1%. All processing performed on Proteome Discoverer.

### Publication Abstract
Myogenic differentiation, the irreversible developmental process where precursor myoblast muscle stem cells become contractile myotubes, is heavily regulated by glycosylation and glycan-protein interactions at the cell surface and the extracellular matrix. The glycan-binding protein galectin-1 has been found to be a potent activator of myogenic differentiation. While it is being explored as a potential therapeutic for muscle repair, a precise understanding of its glycoprotein interactors is lacking. These gaps are due in part to the difficulties of capturing glycan-protein interactions in live cells. Here, we demonstrate the use of a proximity tagging strategy coupled with quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to capture, enrich, and identify the glycan-mediated glycoprotein interactors of galectin-1 in cultured live mouse myoblasts. Our interactome dataset can serve as a resource to aid the determination of mechanisms through which galectin-1 promotes myogenic differentiation. Moreover, it can also facilitate the determination of the physiological glycoprotein counter-receptors of galectin-1. Indeed, we identify several known and novel glycan-mediated ligands of galectin-1 as well as validate that galectin-1 binds the native CD44 glycoprotein in a glycan-mediated manner.
