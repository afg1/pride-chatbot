### Title
Candida albicans Proteome profiling data

### Description
Proteomic analysis of the effects of SWL-1 on C. albicans  showed that several enzymes were downregulated in the glycolytic pathway

### Sample Protocol
Take an appropriate amount of Candida albicans extracts protein for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, then take the protein solution for FASP enzymatic peptide quantification, take 100 μg peptide for iTRAQ labeling, and the labeled peptides for SCX classification and mass spectrometry analysis

### Data Protocol
Use Mascot2.2 and Proteome Discoverer1.4 to perform database identification and quantitative analysis, and use Blast2GO to perform GO annotation on the target protein collection，The FASTA protein sequences of differentially changed proteins were blasted  against the online Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database  to retrieve their KOs and were subsequently mapped to  pathways in KEGG11. The corresponding KEGG pathways were extracted.

### Publication Abstract
<i>Candida albicans</i> is a ubiquitous clinical fungal pathogen. Prolonged use of the first-line antifungal agent fluconazole (FLC) has intensified fungal resistance and limited its effectiveness for the treatment of fungal infections. The combined administration of drugs has been extensively studied and applied. SWL-1 is a lignin compound derived from the Traditional Chinese Medicine <i>Schisandra chinensis</i>. In this study, we show that SWL-1 reverses resistance to fluconazole in <i>C. albicans</i> when delivered in combination, with a sharp decrease in the IC<sub>50</sub> of fluconazole from &gt;200 to 3.74 &#xb1; 0.25 &#x3bc;g/ml, and also reverses the fluconazole resistance of <i>C. albicans in vitro</i>, with IC<sub>50</sub> from &gt;200 to 5.3 &#xb1; 0.3 &#x3bc;g/ml. Moreover, killing kinetics curves confirmed the synergistic effects of fluconazole and SWL-1. Intriguingly, when SWL-1 was administered in combination with fluconazole in a mouse model of systemic infection, the mortality of mice was markedly decreased and fungal colonization of the kidney and lung was reduced. Further mechanistic studies showed that SWL-1 significantly decreased intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels and inhibited the function of the efflux pump responsible for fluconazole resistance of <i>C. albicans</i>. Proteomic analysis of the effects of SWL-1 on <i>C. albicans</i> showed that several enzymes were downregulated in the glycolytic pathway. We speculate that SWL-1 significantly decreased intracellular ATP levels by hindering the glycolysis, and the function of the efflux pump responsible for fluconazole resistance of <i>C. albicans</i> was inhibited, resulting in restoration of fluconazole sensitivity in FLC-resistant <i>C. albicans</i>. This study clarified the effects and mechanism of SWL-1 on <i>C. albicans in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, providing a novel approach to overcoming fungal resistance.
