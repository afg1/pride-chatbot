### Title
Genomic Survey of Aspergilli Proteases

### Description
We have performed a combined analysis of comparative genomics, proteomics and enzymology tests on seven Aspergillus species grown on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp to identify the various proteases and their productivities in Aspergilli.

### Sample Protocol
Culture media from seven Aspergillus species were grown for 72 hours at 30 degrees Celcius on a shaker at 250 rpm. For Proteamics analysis; media was precipitated in cold TCA-Acetone, pellet resuspended in 100 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate with 0.1% Acid Labile Detergent (AALS II), reduced, alkylated and digested overnigth with trypsin. Samples were desalted with c18 ziptips prior to MSMS injection.

### Data Protocol
MSMS raw data was processed using the precursor ion detection workflow of Proteome Discoverer Quant 1.3. Spectral counts and Protein Area values Normalized to the values for spiked predigested Bovine Serun Albumin was used to compare protease expression across different samples
