### Title
TBK1-mediated LC3C phosphorylation site identification

### Description
In order to identify TBK1-mediated LC3C phosphorylation sites, proteins were overexpressed in SILAC labelled cells.

### Sample Protocol
GFP-LC3C was tranfected into SILAC labelled HEK293T cells and GFP immunoprecipitated. SILAC conditions were: heavy label - TBK1 WT overexpression; light label - TBK1 kinase dead overexpression.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 software. The database used to identify the peptides was the human reference protein database (uniprot downloaded december 2017) and the FDR 1%, 1% PSM and 1% site decoy level.
