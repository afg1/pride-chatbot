### Title
Matrix reverses immortalization-mediated stem cell fate determination

### Description
Primary cell culture in vitro suffers from cellular senescence. We hypothesized that expansion on decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) deposited by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 LT) transduced autologous infrapatellar fat pad stem cells (IPFSCs) could rejuvenate high-passage IPFSCs in both proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation. In the study, we found that SV40 LT transduced IPFSCs exhibited increased proliferation and adipogenic potential but decreased chondrogenic potential. Expansion on dECMs deposited by passage 5 IPFSCs yielded IPFSCs with dramatically increased proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation capacity; however, this enhanced capacity diminished if IPFSCs were grown on dECM deposited by passage 15 IPFSCs. Interestingly, expansion on dECM deposited by SV40 LT transduced IPFSCs yielded IPFSCs with enhanced proliferation and chondrogenic capacity but decreased adipogenic potential, particularly for the dECM group derived from SV40 LT transduced passage 15 cells. Our immunofluorescence staining and proteomics data identify matrix components such as basement membrane proteins top candidates for matrix mediated IPFSC rejuvenation. Both cell proliferation and differentiation were endorsed by transcripts measured by RNASeq during the process. This study provides a promising model for in-depth investigation of matrix protein influence on surrounding stem cell differentiation.

### Sample Protocol
dECMs (C5E, S5E, C15E and S15E), expanded cells (CC, C5C, S5C, C15C and S15C) and pellet samples (CP, C5P, S5P, C15P and S15P) from Experiment 2 were chemically and enzymatically digested prior to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described [19] with the following exceptions. Digested samples were desalted and concentrated on a Thermo Scientific Pierce C18 tip and analyzed on a Thermo nanoEasy LC II coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on an in-house made 20 cm C18 analytical column (100 μm ID) packed with 2.7 μm Phenomenex Cortecs C18 resin. Gradient conditions and MS acquisition parameters were described previously [20].

### Data Protocol
Raw files were directly loaded into the Proteome Discoverer 2.2 and searched against the human uniprotKB database (release date 2018.08) utilizing the Mascot search engine. Mass tolerances were set to +/- 10 ppm for MS parent ions and +/- 25 ppm for MS/MS fragment ions. Trypsin specificity was used allowing for 1 missed cleavage. Cys carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and variable modifications included Met oxidation, Pro hydroxylation, protein N-terminal acetylation and peptide N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formation. Search results were exported into a spreadsheet for further processing with figures generated utilizing GraphPad.
