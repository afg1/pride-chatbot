### Title
TOFIMS mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics refines tumor antigen identification

### Description
T cell recognition of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-presented tumor-associated peptides is central for cancer immune surveillance. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics represents the only unbiased method for directly identifying and characterizing naturally presented tumor-associated peptides, which represent a key prerequisite for the development of T cell-based immunotherapies. This study reports on the de novo implementation of ion mobility separation-based timsTOF MS for next-generation immunopeptidomics, enabling high-speed and sensitive detection of HLA peptides. A direct comparison of timsTOF-based with state-of-the-art immunopeptidomics using orbitrap technology showed significantly increased HLA peptide identifications from benign and malignant primary samples of solid tissue and hematological origin. First application of timsTOF immunopeptidomics for tumor antigen discovery enabled (i) the expansion of benign reference immunopeptidome databases with more than 150,000 HLA peptides from 94 primary benign tissue samples, (ii) the refinement of previously described tumor antigens, and (iii) the identification of a vast array of novel tumor antigens comprising low abundant neoepitopes that might serve as targets for future cancer immunotherapy development.

### Sample Protocol
HLA class I and II molecules were isolated using standard immunoaffinity purification as described (DOI: 10.1007/978-1-62703-218-6_12) using the pan-HLA class IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“specific mAb W6/32, the pan-HLA class IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“specific mAb TuÃƒÅ’Ã‹â€ 39, and the HLA-DRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“specific mAb L243 (produced in-house). HLA ligand extracts were analyzed in 3 technical replicates using the timsTOF Pro device (Bruker). In brief, samples were separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (nanoElute, Bruker) using an acclaim TM PepMap (thermo Fisher Scientific) and a 75Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµmx25cm Aurora emitter column (IonOpticks) and a gradient ranging from 0-60% over 55 min folowed by 5 min 95% acetonitril with 0.01% formic acid (total 60 min). Eluting peptides were analyzed on-line timsTOF Pro in PASEF mode and collision induced dissociation. Ten samples were additionally analyzed using prevously described methods(DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1416389112). In brief, peptide samples were separated by nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano UHPLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 75 ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼m ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€� 2 cm PepMap Nanotrap and a 50 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµm x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a gradient ranging from 2.4% to 32.0% acetonitrile over the course of 90 minutes. Eluting peptides were analyzed in an on-line coupled Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) employing a top-speed collisional-induced dissociation or higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed using Bioinformatics Solutions Inc. PEAKS Studio 10.6. Three DDA runs, i.e. three technical replicates, were co-processed. For precursor mass an error tolerance of 20.0 ppm (monoisotopic mass) and 0.02 for fragment ions was allowed. For enzymatic digest, "none" was selected in unspecific digest mode. As a variable PTM, methionine oxidation (+15.9949) was selected with maximum 3 PTMs allowed per peptide. As database the human reference proteome datase was selected/ downloaded prior from Uniprot (14.10.2020). A False-discovery-rate was estimated with a decoy-fusion. Filters post-processing included: 1% FDR for Peptides with a PTM Ascore >20; -10lgP 0 abd 0 unique peptides with significant peptides for proteins; De Novo score >80.
