### Title
Human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells LC-MSMS

### Description
Identification of proteins interacting with vimentin in A549 cells by using LC-MSMS

### Sample Protocol
A549 cells which express highly amount of endogenous vimentin were lysis with NP40 buffer (50mM pH8.0 Tris-HCl; 150mM NaCl; 0.5%NP40; 1mM EDTA; protease Inhibitor) on ice for 15 min. Scrape cells and harvest the supernatant by centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ℃.  Then proceed immunoprecipitation according to the protocol of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher, #10004D). Briefly, incubate Dynabeads Protein G with anti-vimentin antibody (Abcam, #ab137321) with rotation for 30 min at RT. Place the tube with Dynabeads-Ab complex on the magnet to remove the supernatant. Then add the cell supernatant and incubate with rotation for 30 min at RT or overnight at 4 ℃ to allow antigen to bind to the beads-Ab complex. Wash the Dynabeads-Ab-Ag complex 3 times. Then elute target antigen with SDT buffer (4%SDS; 100mM pH8.0 Tris-HCl; 1mM DTT). After reduction and alkylation, the sample was hydrolyzed by trypsin at 37 ℃ for 20 hours. After desalination, the enzymatic hydrolysate was freeze-dried, re-dissolved in 0.1% formic acid solution and stored at-20 ℃ for use.The peptide mixture was load onto reverse phase trap column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100,100 μm×2 cm, nanoViper C18)connected to the C18-reversed phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific Easy Column, 10 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter, 3 μm resin) in buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (84% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid).

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) that was coupled to Easy nLC(Proxeon Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The raw file of LC-MS/MS was processed in Proteome Discoverer1.4 software.
