### Title
Protein neighborhood of the pseudokinase SCYL1

### Description
12 BioID experiments were performed. Quantification was done by classical triple SILAC. The neighborhoods of SCYL1-WT were compared to SCYL1-Ser754Ala and SCYL1-Ser754Glu mutants. “BirA-only” cells were used as negative control.

### Sample Protocol
Streptavidin APs were performed. Beads of BioID experiments were mixed, proteins were digested in solution with trypsin, peptides purified by STAGE tips and analysed by data dependent LC-MSMS.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed with MaxQuant 1.6.2.10 and searched against a full length human uniprot database, version March 2016. Triple SILAC (0/0, 4/6, 8/10) was chosen as quantification mode.
