### Title
Oxidative Stress and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling Are  Signature Pathways of Extracellular Vesicles Released upon Morphine Exposure on Human Brain Microvascular  Endothelial Cells

### Description
Morphine, a commonly used antinociceptive drug in hospitals, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by first passing through brain endothelial cells. Despite its pain-relieving effect, morphine also has detrimental effects, such as the potential induction of redox imbalance in the brain. However, there is still insufficient evidence of these effects on the brain, particularly on the brain endothelial cells and the extracellular vesicles that they naturally release. Indeed, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized bioparticles produced by almost all cell types and are currently thought to reflect the physiological state of their parent cells. These vesicles have emerged as a promising source of biomarkers by indicating the functional or dys-functional state of their parent cells and, thus, allowing a better understanding of the biological processes involved in an adverse state. However, there is very little information on the mor-phine effect on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), and even less on their released EVs. Therefore, the current study aimed at unraveling the detrimental mechanisms of morphine exposure (at 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 µM) for 24 h on human brain microvascular endothe-lial cells as well as on their associated EVs. Isolation of EVs was carried out using an affini-ty-based method. Several orthogonal techniques (NTA, western blotting and proteomics analy-sis) were used to validate the EVs enrichment, quality and concentration. Data-independent mass spectrometry (DIA-MS)-based proteomics was applied in order to analyze the proteome modu-lations induced by morphine on HBMECs and EVs. We were able to quantify almost 5500 pro-teins in HBMECs and 1500 proteins in EVs, of which 256 and 148, respectively, were found to be differentially expressed in at least one condition. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the “cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling” process and the “HIF1 pathway”, a pathway related to oxidative stress responses, were significantly modulated upon morphine exposure in HBMECs and EVs. Altogether, the combination of proteomics and bioinformatics findings high-lighted shared pathways between HBMECs exposed to morphine and their released EVs. These results put forward molecular signatures of morphine-induced toxicity in HBMECs that were also carried by EVs. Therefore, EVs could potentially be regarded as a useful tool to investigate brain endothelial cells dysfunction, and to a different extent, the BBB dysfunction in patient cir-culation using these “signature pathways”.

### Sample Protocol
10 µg of proteins were reduced using TCEP for each sample of cells and EVs at morphine concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM (final concentration 5 mM, 30 min, 37 °C) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), alkylated using iodoacetamide (final concentration 15 mM, 60 min, RT, in dark conditions) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and digested by an overnight tryptic digestion (w/w ratio 1:50) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The RapiGest surfactant was cleaved by incubating samples with 0.5% trifluoacetic acid (Sig-ma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples were then desalted on a C18 reverse phase column (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA), peptides were dried under vacuum and subsequently resuspended in 5% ACN 0.1% FA (peptides final con-centration of 0.5 µg/µL and spiked with iRT peptide (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland) (1:20)).

### Data Protocol
the equivalent of 2 µg of peptides for each sample (cells and EVs) were analyzed using Liquid Chromatography–Electrospray ionization-MS/MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an EASY nLC1200 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scien-tific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptides were trapped on a 2 cm × 75 μm i.d. PepMap C18 pre-column packed with 3 μm particles and 100 Å pore size. Separation was performed using a 50 cm × 75 μm i.d. PepMap C18 column packed with 2 μm and 100 Å particles and heated at 50 °C. Peptides were separated using a 160 min segmented gradient of 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 80% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) was performed with a MS1 full scan at a resolution of 60,000 (FWHM) followed by 30 DIA MS2 scan with variable windows. MS1 was performed in the Orbitrap with an AGC target of 1 × 106, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and a scan range from 400 to 1250 m/z. DIA MS2 was performed in the Orbitrap using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 30%. Isolation windows (30) were variables with an AGC target of 2 × 106 and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. DirectDIA performance was used in Spectronaut™ (Biognosys AG, Zurich, Switzerland) to match DIA MS raw data. For the analysis of cells and EVs, protein abundances were exported from Spectro-naut™, and selected proteins were tested for significance using Student’s two-tailed t-test. Protein and peptide intensities were exported and analyzed using mapDIA. No further normalization was applied. The following parameters were used: min peptides = 2, max peptides = 10, min correl = −1 min DE = 0.01, max DE = 0.99 and experimental design = replicate design. Proteins were considered to have significantly changed in abundance with a LFDR < 0.05 and an absolute fold change (|FC|) > 1.2.
