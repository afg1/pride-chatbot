### Title
Characterization of LysargiNase peptide fragmentation

### Description
Comparison of Lyarginase and tryptic digests with regard to fragmentation behaviour/effect of inclusing a ion in peptide assignment scoring

### Sample Protocol
Solube E.coli proteome, denatured, reduced and Cys alkylated was digested with Lysarginase and trypsin (1:100 w/w enzyme:substrate). Peptides were desalted using C18 stage tips before analysis.

### Data Protocol
Acquired QStar data was converted from ABSciex .wiff format to mzXML and analyzed using Comet. Search parameters included precursor tolerance of 200 ppm, 0.2 Da fragment ion tolerance, fixed Cys alkylation and var Met oxidation. Searches were performed in duplicate inccluding a-ions in scoring or not.

### Publication Abstract
To improve proteome coverage and protein C-terminal identification, we characterized the Methanosarcina acetivorans thermophilic proteinase LysargiNase, which cleaves before lysine and arginine up to 55 &#xb0;C. Unlike trypsin, LysargiNase-generated peptides had N-terminal lysine or arginine residues and fragmented with b ion-dominated spectra. This improved protein C terminal-peptide identification and several arginine-rich phosphosite assignments. Notably, cleavage also occurred at methylated or dimethylated lysine and arginine, facilitating detection of these epigenetic modifications.
