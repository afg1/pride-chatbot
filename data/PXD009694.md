### Title
Analysis of the Chlamydomonas proteome with UPS1 spike-in

### Description
Benchmarking dataset for the objective evaluation of quantitative and statistical workflows.

### Sample Protocol
Wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain CC-2895 6145c mt- was grown photoheterotrophically in 250 mL flasks holding 100 mL of Tris-acetate-phosphate medium. Cultures were maintained at 22°C on a platform shaker at 120 rpm under continuous illumination and grown to mid-log phase (OD750 0.4-0.5). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen before storage at -80°C.  Protein lysate was split into technical replicates and spiked with the appropriate amount of UPS1 standard (Sigma), either 25, 50, or 100 fmol standard per 1 µg Chlamydomonas protein. All reversibly oxidized cysteine residues were reduced using dithiothreitol and nascent thiols were alkylated using iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis to survey the global proteome.

### Data Protocol
Label-free quantification using Progenesis QI for proteomics v2.0, database searching with Mascot v2.5.1, and bioinformatics using R.
