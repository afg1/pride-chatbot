### Title
PrimPol primase mediates replication traverse of DNA interstrand crosslinks

### Description
Human cancer cells rely on PRIMPOL primase activity to mediate ICL traverse, sustain DNA synthesis and complete DNA replication

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitation. 8M Urea 100mM Tris-HCl elution. FASP digestion Lysc-Trypsin. Stage-Tip c18 desalting. LC-MSMS analysis Orbitrap-Velos

### Data Protocol
Raw data was analyzed by MaxQuant against a H. sapiens database supplemented with the sequences of the contaminants most frequently detected in the proteomics lab (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, 20,599 sequences). Minimal peptide length was set to 6 amino acids and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Peptides and proteins were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Student’s T-test statistics were used for determining the significance of the intensity of each protein.
