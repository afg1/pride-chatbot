### Title
H1299 Cell Line LC-MSMS plus 29 synthetic peptides corresponding putative UTR peptides

### Description
H1299 cell line proteome for searching novel UTR(untranslated region)peptides. This project includes 29 synthetic peptides corresponding putative UTR peptides.

### Sample Protocol
H1299: 1 mg proteins, cysteine blocking by iodoacetamide, trypsinization, C18 desalting, basic reversed-phase fractionation of 24 fractions. Synthetic peptides have heavy (arg10 or lys8) c-term amino acid residues.

### Data Protocol
Searched with proteome discoverer 2.3. Sequest module with human uniprot reference database. Detailed protocol is decribed in PDresult file.

### Publication Abstract
