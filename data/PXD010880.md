### Title
OxRAC Analysis of Cysteine Oxidation After EGF stimulation in A431 Cells

### Description
Analysis of cysteine redox networks 0, 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after stimulation with EGF in A431 cells using a new workflow 'OxRAC' optimized to assess dynamic redox regulation.

### Sample Protocol
Free thiols are blocked with NEM, followed by reduction and binding of previously oxidized cysteines to thiolpropylsepharose. After on-resin trypsin digestion, samaples are eluted and labeled with iodoacetamide to differentially alkylate cysteines. Samples were analyzed by DDA and DIA.

### Data Protocol
MS2 database searches were performed with Mascot and Maxquant against the human reference proteome in Uniprot. DIA data was processed using Skyline.
