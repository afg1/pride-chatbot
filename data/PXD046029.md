### Title
De novo identification of bacterial antigens of a clinical isolate by combining use of proteosurfaceomics, secretomics, and BacScan technologies

### Description
Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant threat to both human and animal populations. Rapid de novo identification of protective antigens from a clinical isolate and development of an antigen-matched vaccine is a golden strategy to prevent the spread of emerging novel pathogens. Here, we have developed a universal pipeline by integrating proteosurfaceomics, secretomics, and BacScan technologies for the rapid de novo identification of bacterial protective proteins from a clinical isolate without prior knowledge of the pathogenic bacterium. As a proof of concept, we identified 3 novel protective proteins of A. pleuropneumoniae. Using the protective protein HBS1_14 and toxin proteins, we have developed a promising multivalent subunit vaccine against A. pleuropneumoniae. We believe that our strategy can be applied to any bacterial pathogen and has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of antigen-matched vaccines to prevent the spread of an emerging novel bacterial pathogen.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, and the gel slices were distained, dehydrated, and then subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated and analyzed using a Q ExactiveTM series mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with Nanospray Flexâ„¢ (ESI).

### Data Protocol
The acquired spectra were searched against the Uniprot database using the search engines: Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (PD 2.2, Thermo). The protein identification lists were filtered to maintain a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1% for ensuring high accuracy.
