### Title
CEGS Proteomics -  A multiregional proteomic survey of the postnatal human brain

### Description
Here we exploit label-free quantitative tandem mass-spectrometry proteomics to create the first in-depth quantitative proteomic survey of regions of the postnatal human brain.  We adopted a dual approach to analysing these human brain samples similar to that of a recent high-quality study of the mouse brain proteome by Sharma et al, 2015.  First was the discovery phase, designed to create a highly sensitive, heavily fractionated spectral library for each adult brain region.  Then, to produce a quantitative run for each adult and postnatal development sample, single shot LC-MS/MS runs were used to accurately quantify proteins based on detected precursor peptide ion mass.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation Frozen brain samples were weighed and added to lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate, Complete Protease inhibitor (Roche)) at 1:10 weight:volume.  Samples were homogenised by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4oC, 10 minutes on a desktop centrifuge.  Lysates were quantified by BCA assay, and adjusted to 100 μg protein in 50 μL 8 M Urea, 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate.  pH was confirmed to be ~8. Dithiothreitol (45 mM at 1/10th sample volume) was added to lysates for 30 minutes at 37oC, followed by addition of iodoacetamide (100 mM at 1/10th sample volume) for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature.  Samples were diluted to 2 M urea with deionised water, before addition of trypsin at 1:20 trypsin:protein ratio.  Proteins were digested overnight for 16 hours at 37oC.  The digestion was quenched by adjusting the pH to below 3 by the addition of 20 % trifluoroacetic acid, desalted using C18 Macro Spin Columns (Nest Group) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Peptides eluted from the column were dried in a SpeedVac and stored at -20oC.  Dried peptides were dissolved in 3.5% formic acid (FA) / 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and peptide concentrations were estimated from A280 absorbance using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000.  Aliquots were diluted accordingly with additional 0.1%TFA to a final concentration of 0.04 μg/μl, with 0.2 μg loaded on column for mass spectrometric analysis.  This procedure was used for both fractionated and single-shot runs.  Fractionation of samples Master region pools were produced by adding 40 μg of homogenate from each of the adult (period 13) subjects, to make 200 μg total per region.  Pooled lysates were processed for proteomic analysis as described above.  Peptides were dissolved in 53 μL 0.1% TFA and injected onto a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (BEH) C18 column (130 Angstrom, 1.7 μL, 2.1 mm x 100 mM) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. A Waters H-class UPLC system with Buffers (A:100% water with 10mM ammonium acetate, pH 10; B: 90% water/10% acetonitrile (ACN) with 10mM ammonium acetate, pH10) were used to separate the peptides with a gradient 0.0 min - 2% B, 2.19 min - 2% B, 19.83 min - 37% B, 28.65 min - 75% B, 33.06 min - 98% B, 34.53 min - 98% B, 37.47 min - 2% B, 40min - 2% B. 48 fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.  Fractions from each brain region were then pooled based on their estimated concentration from analysis of the chromatogram into 15 pools, and each pool was subsequently analysed individually by LC MS/MS.  Mass-spectrometry analysis (LC MS/MS) For both the pooled fractionated runs and the single shot quantitative runs, MS analyses were performed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled online to a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC in “low pH” condition.  Peptides were separated over a 180-minute gradient run using a Waters Symmetry C18 (1.7 μM, 180 μM x 20 mM) and a 1.7 μm (75 μm id x 250 mm) ACQUITY UPLC PST (BEH) C18 column at 37oC.  Trapping was carried out for 3 minutes at 5 μL/min, 99% Buffer A (99% water, 0.1% FA) and 1% Buffer B (0.0075% FA in ACN) prior to eluting with linear gradients that reached 30% B at 140 min, 40% B at 155 min, and 85% B at 160 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min.  MS1 (300 to 1500 m/z, target value 3E6, maximum ion injection times 45 ms) were acquired and followed by higher energy collisional dissociation based fragmentation (normalised collision energy 28).  A resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 was used for MS1 scans, and up to 20 dynamically chosen, most abundant, precursor ions were fragmented (isolation window 1.7 m/z).  The MS2 scans were acquired at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200 (target value 1E5, maximum ion injection times 100 ms).

### Data Protocol
Data analysis Mass spectra were processed using MaxQuant35 (v1.5.2.1).  Spectra were searched against the full set of human protein sequences annotated in Gencode46 (version 21; hg38) using the Andromeda search engine47.  This search included a fixed modification, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and two variable modifications, N-acetylation and methionine oxidation. Peptides shorter than 7 amino-acids were not considered for further analysis due to lack of uniqueness and a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) was used to filter poor identifications at both the peptide and protein level. Where possible, peptide identification information was matched between runs of the fractionated and single-shot samples within MaxQuant35. This exploits the accurate mass and retention times across liquid chromatography (LC)-MS runs to infer the identity of a peptide in a particular run in which the precursor ion is detected but was not selected for identification by MS2. For the single shot spatio-temporal analysis of human brain samples, mass spectra were matched against the full peptide library of the brain-region-specific proteome (Table S2) as well as the other single shot runs. To be included in the region-specific dataset, peptides were required to have at least 2 MS/MS scans. Protein identification required at least one unique or razor peptide per protein group. Quantification in MaxQuant was performed using the label free quantification (maxLFQ) algorithm48.  Downstream analysis All downstream analysis was performed using R/Bioconductor50.   Normalisation / pre-processing Human mass spectrometry data were obtained from the ‘proteinGroups.txt’ and ‘peptides.txt’ tables which are output from MaxQuant.  As spectra were mapped to gencode isoforms, Ensembl transcript IDs were generalised to their corresponding Ensembl gene IDs.  Entries corresponding only to reverse DB hits or to common mass-spectrometry contaminants were removed.  Label Free Quants (LFQ) for the single shot samples were extracted and duplicated rows (redundant gene entries) were summed.  Sample LFQ distributions were log10 transformed, scaled by their 75th percentile, and batch corrected using ComBat51.  Batch correction was employed as the single shot samples were prepared and run in two discrete batches due to sample availability.

### Publication Abstract
Detailed observations of transcriptional, translational and post-translational events in the human brain are essential to improving our understanding of its development, function and vulnerability to disease. Here, we exploited label-free quantitative tandem mass-spectrometry to create an in-depth proteomic survey of regions of the postnatal human brain, ranging in age from early infancy to adulthood. Integration of protein data with existing matched whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) from the BrainSpan project revealed varied patterns of protein-RNA relationships, with generally increased magnitudes of protein abundance differences between brain regions compared to RNA. Many of the differences amplified in protein data were reflective of cytoarchitectural and functional variation between brain regions. Comparing structurally similar cortical regions revealed significant differences in the abundances of receptor-associated and resident plasma membrane proteins that were not readily observed in the RNA expression data.
