### Title
Respiratory effects of exposure to aerosol from the candidate modified-risk tobacco product THS 2.2 in an 18-month systems toxicology study with A/J mice [Lung data]

### Description
Smoking cessation is the most effective measure for reducing the risk of smoking-related diseases but switching to less harmful products (modified-risk tobacco products) can be an alternative for smokers who would otherwise not quit. In an 18-month chronic carcinogenicity/toxicity study in A/J mice (OECD Test Guideline 453), we assessed aerosol from the Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS 2.2), a candidate modified-risk tobacco product based on the heat-not-burn principle, compared with 3R4F cigarette smoke (CS). To capture toxicity- and disease-relevant mechanisms, we complemented standard toxicology endpoints with in-depth systems toxicology analyses. Briefly, female A/J mice were exposed to fresh air (Sham), three concentrations of THS 2.2 aerosol corresponding to nicotine concentrations of 6.7 (Low; L), 13.4 (Medium; M), and 26.8 (High; H) µg nicotine\L test atmosphere, or to one concentration of 3R4F CS (13.4 µg nicotine\L test atmosphere) in whole-body exposure chambers for 6 h per day, 5 days per week, and up to 18 months. Interim dissections were scheduled for months 1, 5, and 10. Male mice were exposed to either fresh air (Sham) or to the high THS 2.2 aerosol concentration for 15 months. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity endpoints outlined in the OECD protocol were assessed; detailed findings will be reported separately (Wong et al.). For evaluation of non-OECD endpoints following a systems toxicology approach (proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics), several tissues were collected for further analysis. Housing and all procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol in an Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore-licensed and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility, where the care and use of the animals for scientific purposes were in accordance with the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR) Guideline (NACLAR, 2004). Animals allocated to the omics endpoints (N=8-20) were dissected within 16-24 h of the last exposure and following randomization of all planned necropsies for the dissection time point in question. All efforts to minimize potential nucleic acid and protein degradation were made, and samples were frozen as rapidly as possible once ex vivo. Lungs collected after month 1 were snap-frozen and the right caudal lobe was used for proteomics analysis.  These are the protein expression data for lung tissue assessed by iTRAQ®-based quantitative proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were processed and analyzed in randomized order. Frozen right lung tissue samples were homogenized by using a bead-assisted procedure in a Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in tissue lysis buffer (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) before acetone precipitation. Protein precipitates were resuspended in 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich). Next, 50 ug aliquots of the suspension were processed by using the iTRAQÂ® 8-plex labeling procedure in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). A trypsin/Lys C mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the samples at a 1:10 ratio (w/w). This was followed by overnight digestion at 37C. Peptides were labeled with reporter-ion tags for different exposure groups. For each exposure time point, a single multiplexed iTRAQ set layout was defined, with one sample of each exposure type. A pooled reference mix was also included. The biological replicates of each sample type were assigned to separate iTRAQ labeling sets. For this, the replicate samples of each type were assigned randomly to the different iTRAQ labeling sets. If applicable, missing samples were replaced by placeholder samples of the same sample type that were subsequently removed during data processing. Within each iTRAQ set, the sample-to-channel mapping was randomized, including for the reference mix sample. All labeled samples that belonged to one iTRAQ(R) replicate set were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator (RVC 2-25 CD Plus; Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The samples were desalted by using 0.5-mL bed detergent-removal columns (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and then with 1-cc C18 reversed-phase Sep-Pak columns (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac evaporator and resuspended in nanoLC buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid; Sigma-Aldrich). They were analyzed in random order by using an Easy nanoLC 1000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected online to a Q Exactiveâ„¢ mass analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm Acclaimâ„¢ PepMapâ„¢ 100 C18 LC column (2-Î¼m particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min, with a 200-min gradient from nanoLC buffer A to 40% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid. Each sample was injected twice, with two different analytical methods on the same column (one fast and one sensitive method), as previously described (Kelstrup et al. 2014).

### Data Protocol
The outputs of both MS runs were combined as merged mass-lists and interrogated against the mouse reference proteome set (UniProt, version July 2014, canonical isoforms only) by using Proteome Discoverer, version 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SequestHT (implemented in Proteome Discoverer) was used as the search tool, and iTRAQ(R) reporter-ion intensities were determined from Proteome Discoverer. The Percolator node of Proteome Discoverer was used to estimate peptide-level FDR-adjusted p values (q values). iTRAQ(R) peptide-level quantification data were exported and further processed in the R statistical environment (R Development Core Team 2007). Quantification data were filtered for q values <0.01 and 'unique' quantification results, as defined by Proteome Discoverer. A global variance-stabilizing normalization was performed with the corresponding Bioconductor package in R (Huber et al. 2002; Hultin-Rosenberg et al. 2013). Each iTRAQ(R) reporter-ion set was normalized to its median, and protein expression values were calculated as the medians of these normalized peptide-level quantification values (Herbrich et al. 2013).

### Publication Abstract
Smoking cessation is the most effective measure for reducing the risk of smoking-related diseases. However, switching to less harmful products (modified-risk tobacco products [MRTP]) can be an alternative to help reduce the risk for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. In an 18-month chronic carcinogenicity/toxicity study in A/J mice (OECD Test Guideline 453), we assessed the aerosol of Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS 2.2), a candidate MRTP based on the heat-not-burn principle, compared with 3R4F cigarette smoke (CS). To capture toxicity- and disease-relevant mechanisms, we complemented standard toxicology endpoints with in-depth systems toxicology analyses. In this part of our publication series, we report on integrative assessment of the apical and molecular exposure effects on the respiratory tract (nose, larynx, and lungs). Across the respiratory tract, we found changes in inflammatory response following 3R4F CS exposure (eg, antimicrobial peptide response in the nose), with both shared and distinct oxidative and xenobiotic responses. Compared with 3R4F CS, THS 2.2 aerosol exerted far fewer effects on respiratory tract histology, including adaptive tissue changes in nasal and laryngeal epithelium and inflammation and emphysematous changes in the lungs. Integrative analysis of molecular changes confirmed the substantially lower impact of THS 2.2 aerosol than 3R4F CS on toxicologically and disease-relevant molecular processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress responses, and xenobiotic metabolism. In summary, this work exemplifies how apical and molecular endpoints can be combined effectively for toxicology assessment and further supports findings on the reduced respiratory health risks of THS 2.2 aerosol.
