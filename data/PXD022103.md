### Title
Dimerisation of the PICTS complex via LC8/Cut-up drives co-transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila

### Description
In animal gonads, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guards genome integrity in part through the co-transcriptional gene silencing of transposon insertions. In Drosophila ovaries, piRNA-loaded Piwi detects nascent transposon transcripts and instructs heterochromatin formation through the Panoramix-induced co-transcriptional silencing (PICTS) complex, containing Panoramix, Nxf2 and Nxt1. Here, we report that the highly conserved dynein light chain LC8/Cut-up (Ctp) is an essential component of the PICTS complex. Loss of Ctp results in transposon de-repression and a reduction in repressive chromatin marks specifically at transposon loci. In turn, Ctp can enforce transcriptional silencing when artificially recruited to RNA and DNA reporters. We show that Ctp drives dimerisation of the PICTS complex through its interaction with conserved motifs within Panoramix. Artificial dimerisation of Panoramix bypasses the necessity for its interaction with Ctp, demonstrating that conscription of a protein from a ubiquitous cellular machinery has fulfilled a fundamental requirement for a transposon silencing complex.

### Sample Protocol
For 3xFLAG-Ctp IP-MS, 1 x 107 OSCs were seeded in 10cm dishes, and transfected with 20 µg 3xFLAG- fusion expression plasmid (Xfect) the following day. Cells were harvested 48 hours post transfection and lysed in IP Lysis Buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) for 45 minutes at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 16,500g for 10 minutes at 4 °C, lysates (with 5% saved as input) were incubated with 50 µl anti-FLAG M2 magnetic agarose beads (Sigma M8823) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed three times for 15 minutes in IP Lysis Buffer, twice in ice-cold PBS and twice in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate before being submitted for mass spectrometry analysis. Samples were digested with trypsin and analysed on a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin and analysed on a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectral .raw files were processed with the SequestHT search engine on Thermo ScientificTM Proteome Discoverer™ 2.2. Data was searched against a custom database derived from FlyBase (“dmel-all-translation-r6.24”) at a 1% spectrum level FDR criteria using Percolator (University of Washington). The node for SequestHT included the following parameters: Precursor Mass Tolerance 20 ppm, Fragment Mass Tolerance 0.02 Da, Dynamic Modifications were methionine oxidation (+15.995 Da), asparagine and glutamine deamination (+0.984 Da). The Precursor Ion Quantifier node (Minora Feature Detector) included a Minimum Trace Length of 5, Max. ΔRT of Isotope Pattern 0.2 minutes. The consensus workflow included peptide validator, protein filter and scorer. For calculation of Precursor ion intensities, Feature mapper was set True for RT alignment, with the mass tolerance of 10ppm. Precursor abundance was quantified based on intensity and the level of confidence for peptide identifications was estimated using the Percolator node with a Strict FDR at q-value < 0.01. Analysis of label-free quantification protein intensity data was carried out in R (version 3.5.1) using the qPLEXanalyzer package (version 1.0.3) (Papachristou et al., 2018). Only unique peptides identified with high confidence (peptide FDR < 1%) and mapping to a single protein were used for analysis. Peptide intensities were normalised between samples by median scaling within sample groups. For proteins with fewer than three unique peptides identified, peptides for which all control (mCherry) samples lacked measurements or for which more than 1 target protein sample lacked measurements were discarded. Remaining missing values were then imputed using the nearest neighbour averaging (knn) imputation method provided in the R package MSnbase (version 2.8.3) (Gatto L & Lilley K 2012). Peptide data was summarised to protein level by summing intensities for all peptides. Differential analysis was then carried out by linear modelling using the limma based methods provided by the qPLEXanalyzer package. Multiple testing correction of p-values was applied using the Benjamini & Yekutieli method to control FDR (Benjamini et al., 2001).
