### Title
Synthetic mutated KRAS peptide KLVVVGAVG

### Description
The peptide was synthesized to support General Commentary submitted to Frontiers in Immunology.

### Sample Protocol
The peptide was dissolved and diluted to a final amount of 0.5 pmol in 5 ul 0.1% formic acid. LC-MSMS analysis was performed using a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The MSMS data was analysed by X! Tandem against the canonical Uniprot human library without specifying any enzymatic digestion. In the output file seq65775.mzid, scan 7573 (doubly charged) represents the most intense peak of the synthetic peptide KLVVVGAVG. It was annotated as Pep_4777_1_1, with evidence PepEv_4876_1_1.
