### Title
Project Grandiose, cell surface protein capture

### Description
The aim of Project Grandiose has been to examine the process of somatic cell (specifically, murine fibroblast) conversion to induced pluripotent stem cells, at many levels (proteome, mRNA, DNA methylation, etc.), over the time course of the conversion. This dataset represents the cell surface proteome portion of the project, namely the set of cell surface glycoproteins that were detected over theproject time course.

### Sample Protocol
A simplified version of the cell surface capture protocol introduced by Bernd Wollscheid* was applied to identify N-glycosylated surface proteins over the project time course. Surface glycoproteins were labeled prior to cell lysis. Following digestion of the proteins in the general lysate, glycopeptides were retained on an affinity column while the rest of the sample was washed away. The peptides were then cleaved off using PNGASE F and analyzed on a Orbitrap mass spectrometer.  * Wollscheid, B.; Bausch-Fluck, D.; Henderson, C.; Oâ€™Brien, R.; Bibel, M.; Schiess, R.; Aebersold, R.; Watts, J.D. Mass-spectrometric identification and relative quantification of N-linked cell surface glycoproteins. Nature Biotechnology 2009. 27, 378.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified through a SEQUEST search of the mass spectrometry data (general search results are included). The list of identified proteins was subsequently filtered according to STATQUEST* confidence level, 20 ppm accuracy and asparagine deamidation.  * Kislinger, T.; Rahman, K.; Radulovic, D.; Cox, B.; Rossant, J.; Emili, A.

### Publication Abstract
Somatic cell reprogramming to a pluripotent state continues to challenge many of our assumptions about cellular specification, and despite major efforts, we lack a complete molecular characterization of the reprograming process. To address this gap in knowledge, we generated extensive transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data sets describing the reprogramming routes leading from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotency. Through integrative analysis, we reveal that cells transition through distinct gene expression and epigenetic signatures and bifurcate towards reprogramming transgene-dependent and -independent stable pluripotent states. Early transcriptional events, driven by high levels of reprogramming transcription factor expression, are associated with widespread loss of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) trimethylation, representing a general opening of the chromatin state. Maintenance of high transgene levels leads to re-acquisition of H3K27me3 and a stable pluripotent state that is alternative to the embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like fate. Lowering transgene levels at an intermediate phase, however, guides the process to the acquisition of ESC-like chromatin and DNA methylation signature. Our data provide a comprehensive molecular description of the reprogramming routes and is accessible through the Project Grandiose portal at http://www.stemformatics.org.
