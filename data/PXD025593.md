### Title
Heart extracellular vesicle proteome mechanical

### Description
Cardiac function is dynamically regulated by intercellular signalling. As an important intercellular signalling mediator, this study focused on isolating and defining membrane bound signalling packages termed extracellular vesicles (EVs) directly from heart using mechanical approaches (direct tissue).

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples (heart-derived EVs and in-depth heart proteome) were digested with trypsin, and the peptide mixture analyzed on a nanoflow UPLC instrument (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano, ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to an Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Label-free MS-based validation study was performed on a separate cohort using single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample separation (SP3) and independently analyzed on an Q-Exactive HF-X Orbitrap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Peptide identification and quantification were performed using MaxQuant (v1.6.14.0) with its built-in search engine Andromeda. Perseus was used to quantify proteins whose expression was identified in at least 60% in at least one group; normalized intensities were log2 transformed, with statistical analyses performed using Studentâ€™s T-test (P < 0.05 considered significant). Gene Ontologies (biological processes) were obtained using DAVID. EnrichmentMap analysis was performed using Cytoscape.
