### Title
ii. Analysing the effects of glycosylation knockdown via CRISPR interference in Burkholderia multivorans

### Description
To determine the effect of CRISPR interference-mediated silencing of glycosylation in Burkholderia multivorans harbouring a pglL-targeted guide, and a nontarget guide using Data Independent Acquisition

### Sample Protocol
Burkholderia cenocepacia cells were grown for 16 hours in the presence or absence of 1% L-Rhamnose at 37 degrees Celsius (with aeration), and 1mL of cells at stationary phase (approx OD600nm 1.5) were harvested and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed in 4% Sodium Deoxycholate (SDC; in 100mM Tris (pH 8.5) through boiling at 95*C, 2000rpm on a ThermoMixer). Protein was quantified by a BCA assay, and 50ug of protein was reduced with 10mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and alkylated with 40mM 2 â€“ Chloroacetamide (CAA). Proteins were digested with 1:100 (wt/wt) trypsin for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Peptides were cleaned up using housemade Styrenedivinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched using Spectronaut 15 using default parameters with the following modifications: Protein LFQ method set to MaxLFQ, single hit proteins excluded, and Major and Minor Group Top N unselected
