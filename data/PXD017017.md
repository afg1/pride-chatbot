### Title
Proteogenomics of Gammarus fossarum individual male and female samples

### Description
Shotgun proteomics dataset for the selection of protein candidates used in a highly-multiplexed targeted Scout-MRM assay.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, and proteins were quantified based on the use of spectral counts.
