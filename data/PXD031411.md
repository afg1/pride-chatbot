### Title
Molecular architecture of the augmin complex

### Description
Haus DSSO CX-MS analysis to validate Cyro-EM analysis of Haus multimer

### Sample Protocol
Crosslinked peptides were digested with trypsin (in-gel or insolution), reduced and alkylated with TCEP and CAA. Followed by desalting with Pierce C18 spin tips and mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
Identification of disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO) crosslinked peptides was performed with Metamorphous V0.0.320 (Lu et al. J. Proteome Res. 2019)
