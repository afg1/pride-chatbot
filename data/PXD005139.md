### Title
Podocyte degradomics -  N-Degradomic Analysis Reveals a Proteolytic Network Processing the Podocyte Cytoskeleton

### Description
Regulated intracellular proteolysis is essential in maintaining the integrity of podocytes and the glomerular filtration barrier of the kidney. Altered proteolytic substrate turnover has been associated with various glomerular diseases ranging from diabetic nephropathy to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, thus far it has not been possible to systematically identify proteolytically cleaved proteins although some of the proteases have been characterized. Here we applied TAILS to map N-termini in the mouse glomeruli proteome and to determine and quantify N termini in podocyte cell cultures challenged with PAN.

### Sample Protocol
Male mice (age 8 weeks, BL6 background) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and kidneys were perfused with magnetic beads to isolate glomeruli as  described (Rinschen et al J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2014). Acetone precipitation was performed and pellets were washed three times with ice-cold methanol. Then, pellets were dried and resuspended with 1mL 6M GHCl and HEPES 200mM, pH 7.5 with a protease inhibitor cocktail, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further processed. N-termini were enriched by Terminal Amine Isotope Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) as described (Kleifeld et al Nature Protocols 2011), using formaldehyde isotopes for light (+28.0313) or heavy (+34.063117) dimethylation of primary amines at protein N termini and Lys side chains. Enriched N terminal peptides were desalted using home made C18 STAGE tips and analyzed on a nano-LC-MS/MS (2.5h Gradient) on line coupled to a Q ExactivePlus mass spectroemter as previously described (Rinschen et al Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016)

### Data Protocol
Spectra were matched to peptide sequences at a false discovery rate of 0.01 using the Andromeda algorithm 40 as implemented in the MaxQuant Software package v.1.5.3.30. Glomeruli datasets were searched against the UniProt mouse proteome with enzyme specificity set as semi-specific (free N-terminus) ArgC, Cys carbamidomethylation and Lys dimethylation (+28.031300) as fixed modifications and var N-terminal dimethylation (+28.031300), N-terminal acetylation (+42.010565) or N-terminal pyroGlu formation from Glu (-18.010565) or Gln (-17.026549).

### Publication Abstract
Regulated intracellular proteostasis, controlled in part by proteolysis, is essential in maintaining the integrity of podocytes and the glomerular filtration barrier of the kidney. We applied a novel proteomics technology that enables proteome-wide identification, mapping, and quantification of protein N-termini to comprehensively characterize cleaved podocyte proteins in the glomerulus <i>in vivo</i> We found evidence that defined proteolytic cleavage results in various proteoforms of important podocyte proteins, including those of podocin, nephrin, neph1, <i>&#x3b1;</i>-actinin-4, and vimentin. Quantitative mapping of N-termini demonstrated perturbation of protease action during podocyte injury <i>in vitro</i>, including diminished proteolysis of <i>&#x3b1;</i>-actinin-4. Differentially regulated protease substrates comprised cytoskeletal proteins as well as intermediate filaments. Determination of preferential protease motifs during podocyte damage indicated activation of caspase proteases and inhibition of arginine-specific proteases. Several proteolytic processes were clearly site-specific, were conserved across species, and could be confirmed by differential migration behavior of protein fragments in gel electrophoresis. Some of the proteolytic changes discovered <i>in vitro</i> also occurred in two <i>in vivo</i> models of podocyte damage (WT1 heterozygous knockout mice and puromycin aminonucleoside-treated rats). Thus, we provide direct and systems-level evidence that the slit diaphragm and podocyte cytoskeleton are regulated targets of proteolytic modification, which is altered upon podocyte damage.
