### Title
RUNX1 isoforms in leukemogenesis

### Description
Aneuploidy and structural aberrations affecting chromosome 21 (Hsa21) are the most frequent in cytogentic events in acute myeloid leukemia. However, it remains unclear why leukemic blasts select for amplifications of Hsa21 or parts of it and why children with Down syndrome (i.e. trisomy 21) are at a high risk of developing leukemia. Here, we propose that disequilibrium of the RUNX1 isoforms and resultant RUNX1A dominance are key to trisomy 21-associated leukemogenesis. Using a Hsa21-focussed CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we uncovered a strong and specific RUNX1 dependency in myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS). High levels of RUNX1A – as seen in ML-DS – synergized with the pathognomonic Gata1s mutation in ML-DS pathogenesis, an effect that was reversed upon restoration of the normal RUNX1A:RUNX1C equilibrium. Mechanistically, RUNX1A displaces RUNX1C from its endogenous binding sites and recruits the MYC cofactor MAX to induce oncogenic programs and perturb normal differentiation. This presents a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited by interfering with MYC:MAX dimerization. Our study highlights the importance of alternative splicing in leukemogenesis, and paves the way for developing specific and targeted therapies for ML-DS as well as for other leukemias with Hsa21 aneuploidy or RUNX1 isoform disequilibrium.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes were proteolyzed with trypsin following the FASP (filter aided sample preparation) protocol. Samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using 180-min gradients on an U3000 nano-HPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus or an orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on reversed phase C18 columns (trapping column: Acclaim PepMap 100, 300 μm × 5 mm, 5μm, 100 Å (Thermo Fisher Scientific); separation column: µPAC™ 50 cm C18 (Pharmafluidics) or self-packed RP C18 separation column (PicoFrit, 75 μM × 250–500 mm, 15 µm tip diameter (New Objective), packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, 120 Å, Dr. Maisch, Germany). After desalting the samples on the trapping column, peptides were eluted and separated using linear gradients from 3% to 40% B (solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, solvent B: 0.08% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) with a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min over 180 or 240 min. For data acquisition with the orbitrap Fusion MS, a data-dependent top 5s method was applied. FTMS survey scans were performed in the m/z range 350-1500 (R = 120,000 at m/z 200, target of the automatic gain control (AGC) 400,000, maximum injection time (IT) 50 ms). MS/MS scans of the most abundant signals of the survey scan were acquired in parallel by FTMS (HCD (higher energy collision-induced dissociation) at 28% NCE (normalized collision energy), AGC 50,000, IT 120 ms) and ITMS (CID (collision induced dissociation), 35% NCE, AGC 10,000, IT 35 ms), isolation window was 1.5 Th. For MS data acquisition with the Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer, high-resolution full scans (m/z 375 to 1799, R = 140,000 at m/z 200) in the orbitrap were followed by high-resolution product ion scans (R = 17,500) of the 10 most intense signals in the full-scan mass spectrum (isolation window 2 Th); AGC was set to 3,000,000 (MS) and 200,000 (MS/MS), IT were set to 100 ms (MS) and 150 ms (MS/MS). For acquisitions on both instruments, precursor ions with charge states <2+ and >6+ or were excluded from fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (duration 60 seconds, window 3 ppm).

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS data were searched against the Uniprot database (version Nov. 2019, tax. homo sapiens, 73801 entries) using SequestHT. Label-free quantification of proteins was based on extracted peak areas of corresponding peptide precursor ions, quantitative data were normalized on total protein abundance. Protein were selected on at a minimum of 3 unique measured peptides. Contaminates were excluded. An abundance log2 ratios of either RUNX1A or RUNX1C versus empty control of greater than 1 (p-value < 0.05) were assumed as significant bound.

### Publication Abstract
Gain of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) is among the most frequent aneuploidies in leukemia. However, it remains unclear how partial or complete amplifications of Hsa21 promote leukemogenesis and why children with Down syndrome (DS) (ie, trisomy 21) are particularly at risk of leukemia development. Here, we propose that RUNX1 isoform disequilibrium with RUNX1A bias is key to DS-associated myeloid leukemia (ML-DS). Starting with Hsa21-focused CRISPR-CRISPR-associated protein 9 screens, we uncovered a strong and specific RUNX1 dependency in ML-DS cells. Expression of the RUNX1A isoform is elevated in patients with ML-DS, and mechanistic studies using murine ML-DS models and patient-derived xenografts revealed that excess RUNX1A synergizes with the pathognomonic Gata1s mutation during leukemogenesis by displacing RUNX1C from its endogenous binding sites and inducing oncogenic programs in complex with the MYC cofactor MAX. These effects were reversed by restoring the RUNX1A:RUNX1C equilibrium in patient-derived xenografts in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo. Moreover, pharmacological interference with MYC:MAX dimerization using MYCi361 exerted strong antileukemic effects. Thus, our study highlights the importance of alternative splicing in leukemogenesis, even on a background of aneuploidy, and paves the way for the development of specific and targeted therapies for ML-DS, as well as for other leukemias with Hsa21 aneuploidy or RUNX1 isoform disequilibrium.
