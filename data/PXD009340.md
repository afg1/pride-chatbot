### Title
Jurkat T-cell Shotgun Proteomics

### Description
Shotgun proteomics to comprehensively identify proteins extracted from Jurkat T-cells in the resting state.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples in PBS (pH 7.4) were extracted from Jurkat T-cells (resting) by ultra-sonication. The protein extracts were digested with trypsin (1:50, by weight) overnight. THe resulting tryptic peptides were directly analysed by EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo)online connected to an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo). The tryptic peptides were separated on a MonoCap C18 HighResolution 3000 column (GL Sciences) using a 380 min gradient.

### Data Protocol
Orbitrap RAW data were converted to an MGF peak list using Mascot Distiller, and the peak list was searched against the decoy Swiss-Prot database (taxonomy = Homo sapiens). Fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (C); variable modifications: oxidation (M), acetylation (protein N-term/K).
