### Title
Molecular analysis of Super oxide dismutase purified from Trachyspermum  ammi

### Description
Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) (SOD) is a standout amongst the most critical metal containing enzymes that can act as a main line of defense against oxidative stress. There has always been an increased interest globally to identify new plant sources with high SOD activity that are pharmacologically potent and have minimum side effects for their use as preventive medicine and in food industry. Trachyspermum  ammi  seeds showed  high SOD activity and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity using various downstream processing techniques like; Salt precipitation, dialysis, IEX, Gel permeation, NATIVE- & SDS-PAGE.

### Sample Protocol
Sample purified from the crude extract was processed for In-gel digestion stained with CBB. The spots/ bands from the PAGE were undergone for MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data will be processed further to analyse different structural and functional parameters like domain, motif and cleavage site etc.,
