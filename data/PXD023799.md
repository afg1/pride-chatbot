### Title
Rnmt cKO versus control activated CD4 T cells

### Description
We aim to find the gene-specific effects of Rnmt KO in mouse CD4 T cells. TMT proteomics datasets were generated to find out which proteins are dependent on RNMT for their expression.

### Sample Protocol
Na√Øve CD4 T cells were FACS sorted, thena ctivated for 20 hours on plate bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Protein purified using SP3 beads, and digested with trypsin. Peptides labelled ith TMT reagents and pooled. Pooled sample was fractionated by high pH reverse phase chromatography. Analysis of peptides was performed using a Q-exactive-HF.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were quantified using M. musculus reviewed SwissProt dataset. Data was normalised using the summed signals of histones and statistical significance calculated using limma.
