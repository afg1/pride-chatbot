### Title
Proteomic analysis of Flavobacterium johnsoniae

### Description
The soil bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae was grown on agar plates with or without pectin,bacteria were harvested, lysed, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis

### Sample Protocol
The samples were subjected to in-solution tryptic digestion using FASP followed by a desalting step. The resulting peptides were analyzed using nanoflow liquid chromatography (nanoAcquity) coupled to high resolution, high mass accuracy mass spectrometry (Q Exactive HF). Each sample was analyzed on the instrument separately in a random order in discovery mode.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was searched against the Flavobacterium Jonhsoniae (Strain 172804) protein database, to which a list of common lab contaminants was added. Database search was done using the Mascot algorithm, and quantitative analysis was performed using the Expressionist software from GeneData
