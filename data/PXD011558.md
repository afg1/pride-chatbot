### Title
Shotgun Proteomic Analysis of ESBL and non ESBL Producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae Clinical Isolates

### Description
Shotgun Proteomic Analysis of ESBL and non ESBL Producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae Clinical Isolates

### Sample Protocol
Each sample was reduced by adding 2μl of 200Mm DTT, vortexing, and then spinning down. The samples were then incubated 30 min at room temperature. For alkylation, 2 µl of 1 M iodoacetamide (IAA) were added to each sample and then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in dark followed by addition of 100mM Tris pH 8.5.  Modified procain trypsin (Sigma, Germany) was added at 50:1 (protein: protease mass ratio) along with 1mM CaCl2 and incubated overnight in a thermo-shaker at 600 rpm at 37°C.

### Data Protocol
Mascot generic format (mgf) files were generated from raw file using script supplied by AB Sciex. MS/MS spectra were searched using X Tandem in Peptide shaker (version 1.16.26) against Klebsiella pneumonia UniProtKB/TrEMBL database (789728 entries) with reversed sequences.
