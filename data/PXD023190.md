### Title
Human blood microRNAs and their potential effect on mosquitoes

### Description
Blood is a rich source of proteins for mosquitoes, but also contains many other molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we found that human blood miRNAs are transported in abundance into the fat body tissue of Aedes aegypti, a key metabolic center in post-blood feeding reproductive events, where they target and regulate mosquito genes.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted, prepared with FASP, reduced/alkylated, tryptic digested, and measured with DDA and DIA/SWATH-MS.

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified by ProteinPilot (SCIEX). The results from ProteinPilot were used to produce an ion library using PeakView (SCIEX). The data output was reformatted with a Python script ReformatMS and proceeded to analyze with MSstats (v3.7.3)
