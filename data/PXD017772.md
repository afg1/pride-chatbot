### Title
DICER-interacting partners in juvenile mouse testes

### Description
DICER has a well-characterized role in the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that are important for post-transcriptional gene regulation. Emerging evidence suggests that DICER also has several non-canonical functions beyond miRNA/siRNA biogenesis, for example in transcriptional gene silencing at the chromatin level, as well as in RNA degradation and maintenance of genomic integrity. We have shown that the function of DICER in germ cells is essential for normal spermatogenesis; male mice lacking DICER in postnatal male germ cells are infertile due to severe defects in haploid differentiation. To better understand the function of DICER in male germ cells, we immunoprecipitated DICER from juvenile mouse testes and performed mass spectrometric analysis to identify DICER-interacting proteins.

### Sample Protocol
DICER was immunoprecipitated from testes lysate of juvenile mice (17-18 days old). Beads were washed with Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and digested with Trypsin at the Turku Proteomics Facility (https://bioscience.fi/services/proteomics/services/) according to the standard protocol. Digested peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and samples were submitted to LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed on a nanoflow HPLC system (Easy-nLC1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. Peptides were first loaded on a trapping column and subsequently separated inline on a 15 cm C18 column (75 μm x 15 cm, ReproSil-Pur 5 μm 200 Å C18-AQ, Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) or acetonitrile/water (80:20 (v/v)) with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). A 30 min gradient from 8 to 43% B was used to elute peptides. MS data was acquired automatically by using Thermo Xcalibur 3.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An information dependent acquisition method consisted of an Orbitrap MS survey scan of mass range 300-2000 m/z followed by HCD fragmentation for 10 most intense peptide ions.

### Data Protocol
Data files were searched for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an in-house server running the Mascot 2.6.1 software (Matrix Science). Data was searched against SwissProt database (version 2018_04) with a taxonomy filter ´mus´.

### Publication Abstract
Constitutive heterochromatin at the pericentric regions of chromosomes undergoes dynamic changes in its epigenetic and spatial organization during spermatogenesis. Accurate control of pericentric heterochromatin is required for meiotic cell divisions and production of fertile and epigenetically intact spermatozoa. In this study, we demonstrate that pericentric heterochromatin is expressed during mouse spermatogenesis to produce major satellite repeat (MSR) transcripts. We show that the endonuclease DICER localizes to the pericentric heterochromatin in the testis. Furthermore, DICER forms complexes with MSR transcripts, and their processing into small RNAs is compromised in Dicer1 knockout mice leading to an elevated level of MSR transcripts in meiotic cells. We also show that defective MSR forward transcript processing in Dicer1 cKO germ cells is accompanied with reduced recruitment of SUV39H2 and H3K9me3 to the pericentric heterochromatin and meiotic chromosome missegregation. Altogether, our results indicate that the physiological role of DICER in maintenance of male fertility extends to the regulation of pericentric heterochromatin through direct targeting of MSR transcripts.
