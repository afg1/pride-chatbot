### Title
A Proteomic Analysis of the Myocardium in Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

### Description
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterised by a complex phenotype that is only partly explained by the biological  effects of individual genetic variants. The aim of this study was to use proteomic analysis of myocardial tissue to explore thepostgenomic phenotype.

### Sample Protocol
Label-free proteomic analysis was used initially to compare protein profiles in myocardial samples from eleven patients with  HCM undergoing surgical myectomy with control samples from six healthy unused donor hearts

### Data Protocol
Differentially expressed proteins of interest were validated in myocardial samples from 65 unrelated individuals [HCM (n=51),  controls (n=7) and aortic stenosis (n=7)] by the development and use of targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) based triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.
