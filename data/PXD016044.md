### Title
H3K9bhb identification of CD8+Tm cells

### Description
MS/MS spectra of a tryptic H3K9 peptide identified from BHB-treated CD8+ Tm cells or 13C-labled BHB-treated memory T cells

### Sample Protocol
To measure β-hydroxybutyrylation of Histone H3, IL-15-derived CD8+ Tm cells were cultured with 10 mM BHB or [U-13C] BHB for 48 hours. Histones were using Histone Purification Kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Histone proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining. Histone bands were sliced into 2 mm sections and then destained, dried, and incubated with trypsin overnight at 37 °C as described previously. Finally, the peptide extract were submitted to nano-UPLC separation using a nanoACQUITY system.

### Data Protocol
MS raw data files were converted into MGF files for identification and relative quantitation using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific)
