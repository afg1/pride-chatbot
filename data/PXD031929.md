### Title
Proteomic Alterations Associated with Residual Disease in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Treated Ovarian Cancer Tissues

### Description
Optimal cytoreduction to no residual disease (R0) correlates with improved disease outcome in the management of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) offers an alternate approach to management of HGSOC patients to achieve complete resection. This study assessed proteomic alterations in matched, chemotherapy naïve and NACT-treated patients tumors obtained from HGSOC patients with suboptimal (R1) versus optimal (R0) debulking at IDS. We describe distinct proteome profiles in pre- and post-NACT HGSOC tumors correlating with residual disease status providing prognostic biomarkers for residual disease at IDS as well as candidate proteins associated with NACT resistance warranting further pre-clinical investigation.

### Sample Protocol
Tumor cells were harvested from paired chemotherapy naïve and NACT-treated FFPE tissues by laser microdissection. Collections were processed by adding buffered acetonitrile solution and incubated in a thermocycler at 99 °C for 1 h followed by 65 °C for 2 h. Proteins were digested by adding 1 µg of trypsin (SMART Digest Trypsin, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubating at 50 °C overnight. Protein digests were vacuum dried and resuspended in LC-MS grade water. Final digest concentrations were determined by colorimetric assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were labeled with tandem-mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling reagents (TMT10plex™ Isobaric Label Reagent Set, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TMT-labeled samples were combined, vacuum dried, and fractionated offline (1260 Infinity II offline liquid chromatography system, Agilent Technologies). Fractions were pooled into twelve concatenated fractions and analyzed in duplicate by RPLC-MS/MS employing a nanoflow LC system (EASY-nLC 1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptide and global protein-level identifications were generated by searching raw data files against a publicly-available, non-redundant human proteome database (Swiss-Prot, http://www.uniprot.org/) using Mascot (v2.6.0, Matrix Science), Proteome Discoverer (v2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and in-house tools.
