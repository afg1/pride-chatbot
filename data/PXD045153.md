### Title
standard protein trifluoromethylation

### Description
standard proteins were trifluoromethylated and the residue sites trifluoromethylation ratios were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis

### Sample Protocol
protein samples were digested by using general routine

### Data Protocol
Thermo Proteome Discoverer (version 2.4.1.15). Variable modifications were set as mono-oxidation (+ [O]) (+ 15.995 Da) to Met and Trp, di-oxidation (+ 2[O]) (+ 31.990 Da) to Trp, mono-trifluoromethylation (+ [CF3]) (+ 67.987 Da) to Trp, Tyr, Phe and His, di-trifluoromethylation (+ 2[CF3]) (+ 135.975 Da) to Trp and Tyr, mono-trifluoromethylation-mono-oxidation (+ [CF3] + [O]) (+ 83.982 Da) and mono-trifluoromethylation-di-oxidation (+ [CF3] + 2[O]) (+ 99.977 Da) to Trp. Static modification was carbamidomethyl (+ 57.021 Da) to Cys. The enzyme was selected as chymotrypsin (FLMWY, full) for haloalkane dehalogenase and trypsin (KR, full) for other proteins. The number of maximum missed cleavage site was 2 for both trypsin and chymotrypsin. Other parameters were set as default values.
