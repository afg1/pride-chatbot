### Title
Glorund corsslinked IP-MS in Drosophila late stage oocyte enriched ovary

### Description
Identification of interaction partners of the sole Drosophila hnRNP F/H homolog, Glorund, during late oogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
Dissected ovaries expressing GFP-Glo were incubated in PBS containing 1 mM DSP (Thermo Scientific) or in PBS without DSP (control) for 30 min at room temperature, quenched by addition of Tris-HCl pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 20 mM, and incubated for 15 min. Ovaries were then homogenized in IP buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL-CA630, 1x cOmplete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF) supplemented with 20 µL of RNase A/T1 Mix (Thermo Scientific) and 20 U of RNase ONE (Promega) per 1 mL of IP buffer and cleared by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 30 min at 4° C. The supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap_A beads (Chromotek) at 4°C for 1.5 hours and the beads were then washed with IP buffer with 1M NaCl and without IGEPAL-CA630. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris base, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT) which also cleaves the disulfide linker in DSP to reverse-crosslink.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was done by the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core at Princeton University. The resulting MS datasets were analyzed using Scaffold 4/5.
