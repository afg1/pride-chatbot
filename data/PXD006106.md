### Title
Aldehyde exposure unmasks genome instability in cells heterozygous for clinically relevant BRCA2 mutations

### Description
Abnormalities provoked in human cells heterozygous for clinically relevant truncating mutations in BRCA2 by their exposure to naturally occurring aldehydes define a mechanism promoting carcinogenesis in mutation carriers.  The ubiquitous metabolite and environmental toxin, formaldehyde, triggers replication fork instability and structural chromosomal aberrations in BRCA2 heterozygous cells. These abnormalities arise from a previously unrecognized effect of formaldehyde to selectively induce the proteasomal degradation of BRCA2, inducing functional haploinsufficiency only in cells where BRCA2 expression is already compromised by a heterozygous mutation. Similar effects are observed with acetaldehyde, a toxic product of alcohol catabolism. Replication fork instability and chromosomal aberrations in aldehyde-exposed cells arise from the unscheduled accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids, revealing a mechanism driving genomic instability in BRCA2 heterozygous cells. We propose a model for cancer pathogenesis in which aldehyde exposure unmasks the carcinogenic potential of heterozygous BRCA2 mutations, with public health implications in mutation carriers.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were suspended in 10M Urea lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and lysed by sonication at 4°C for 2 minutes using a VialTweeter device (Hielscher-Ultrasound Technology).  Peptide samples after digested were measured by SWATH mass spectrometry with previously published Liquid chromatographic (LC) settings.

### Data Protocol
The SWATH-MS identification was performed by OpenSWATH software searching against a previously established SWATH assay library which contains mass spectrometric query parameters for 10,000 human proteins with unique Swiss-Prot identities. To quantify the protein abundance levels across samples, we summed up the most abundant peptides for each protein (i.e., top 3 peptide groups based on intensity were used for those proteins identified with more than three proteotypic peptide signals whereas all the peptides were summarized for other proteins) which allow for reliable estimation of global protein levels.

### Publication Abstract
Mutations truncating a single copy of the tumor suppressor, BRCA2, cause cancer susceptibility. In cells bearing such heterozygous mutations, we find that a&#xa0;cellular metabolite and ubiquitous environmental toxin, formaldehyde, stalls and destabilizes DNA replication forks, engendering structural chromosomal aberrations. Formaldehyde selectively depletes BRCA2 via proteasomal degradation, a mechanism of toxicity that affects very few additional&#xa0;cellular proteins. Heterozygous BRCA2 truncations,&#xa0;by lowering pre-existing BRCA2 expression, sensitize to BRCA2 haploinsufficiency induced by&#xa0;transient exposure to natural concentrations of formaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, an alcohol catabolite detoxified by ALDH2, precipitates similar effects. Ribonuclease H1 ameliorates replication fork instability and chromosomal aberrations provoked by aldehyde-induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency, suggesting that BRCA2 inactivation triggers spontaneous mutagenesis during DNA replication via aberrant RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). These findings suggest a model wherein carcinogenesis in BRCA2 mutation carriers can be incited by compounds found pervasively in the environment and generated endogenously in certain tissues with implications for public health.
