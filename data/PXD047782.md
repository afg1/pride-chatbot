### Title
Ubiquitinome of Plasmodium yoelii lines NSS and NSR

### Description
Ubiquitinome profiling of blood stages of Plasmodium yoelii lines NSS and NSR

### Sample Protocol
To enrich Ub-modified peptides, we used an anti-diglycine-lysine antibody conjugated to agarose beads to capture peptides containing the ubiquitin remnant motif (K-Îµ-GG). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) analysis of trypsin-digested proteins identified ubiquitinated peptides belonging to specific Plasmodium yoelii proteins.

### Data Protocol
The peptides were subjected to a nano-electrospray ion source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) in Q ExactiveTM Plus (Thermo) coupled online to the UPLC. The resulting MSMS data were processed using MaxQuant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against PlasmoDB database (https://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/) concatenated with reverse decoy database.
