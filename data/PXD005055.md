### Title
Molecular determinants of tumor response to hyperthermia

### Description
Proteomic data from ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and SKOV3); treated cells with or without hyperthermia (46 deg C for 1 hr); 2 biological replicates for each cell line/condition

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, labeled with 10-plex TMT, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline

### Publication Abstract
Even though hyperthermia is a promising treatment for cancer, the relationship between specific temperatures and clinical benefits and predictors of sensitivity of cancer to hyperthermia is poorly understood. Ovarian and uterine tumors have diverse hyperthermia sensitivities. Integrative analyses of the specific gene signatures and the differences in response to&#xa0;hyperthermia between hyperthermia-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells identified CTGF as a key regulator of sensitivity. CTGF silencing sensitized resistant cells to hyperthermia. CTGF small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment also sensitized resistant cancers to localized hyperthermia induced by copper sulfide nanoparticles and near-infrared laser in orthotopic ovarian cancer models. CTGF silencing aggravated energy stress induced by hyperthermia and enhanced apoptosis of hyperthermia-resistant cancers.
