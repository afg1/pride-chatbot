### Title
LYSET/TMEM251 SILAC Co-IP from MIA PaCA-2

### Description
Endogenous LYSET/TMEM251 was isolated via Co-IP from MIA PaCa-2 cells. LYSET KO cells were used as controls. Cells were grown in SILAC medium for 3 passages

### Sample Protocol
Lysates were pooled prior to Co-IP according to SILAC labels. Proteins were run for 0.5 cm into an SDS gel. After Coomassie staining, the total sample was cut out and digested with trypsin according to Shevchenko et al. (A. Shevchenko et al., In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes. Nature protocols 1, 2856-2860, 2006), adapted to on a DigestPro MSi robotic system (INTAVIS Bioanalytical Instruments AG). Analysis was carried out on an Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher) connected to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. Analysis time and method were chosen according to expected sample complexity or dynamic range and set to 120 min. Prior to the analytical separation, peptides were online desalted on a trapping cartridge (Acclaim PepMap300 C18, 5 µm, 300 Å pore; Thermo Fisher) for 3 min using 30 µl/min flow of 0.05 % TFA in water. The analytical multistep gradient was carried out on a nanoEase MZ Peptide analytical column (300 Å, 1.7 µm, 75 µm x 200 mm, Waters) using solvent A (0.1 % formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile). The concentration of solvent B was linearly ramped up from 2 % to 30 % within 102 min, followed by a quick ramp up to 78 % B. After 2 min, the concentration of solvent B was lowered back to 2 % and a 10 min equilibration step appended. Eluting peptides were analyzed in the mass spectrometer using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. A full scan at 120k resolution, 380-1400 m/z, 300 % AGC target, 45 ms maxIT, was followed by 2 sec of MS/MS scans. Peptide features were isolated with an isolation width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented using 26 % NCE. Fragment spectra were recorded at 15k resolution (100 % AGC target, 54 ms). Unassigned and singly charged eluting features were excluded from fragmentation and dynamic exclusion was set to 35 s.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis was carried out with MaxQuant (version 1.6.14.0, S. Tyanova et al., The MaxQuant computational platform for mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics. Nature protocols 11, 2301-2319, 2016) using an organism-specific database extracted from Uniprot.org with default settings (download 03.01.2022, 79,057 entries). Identification FDR cutoffs were 0.01 on peptide level and 0.01 on protein level. Match between runs (MBR) option was enabled to transfer peptide identifications across RAW files based on accurate retention time and m/z. MBR was performed over all samples. SILAC quantification was done using a duplex approach with medium channel Arg6, Lys4 and heavy channel Arg10, Lys9; a minimum of 1 quantified peptide per protein was required for protein quantification. Re-quantify option was enabled to stabilize very large or small ratios (J. Cox et al., A practical guide to the MaxQuant computational platform for SILAC-based quantitative proteomics. Nature protocols 4, 698-705, 2009). Advanced ratio estimation was turned off to avoid interference with ratio inversion due to label swap.

### Publication Abstract
Mammalian cells can generate amino acids through macropinocytosis and lysosomal breakdown of extracellular proteins, which is exploited by cancer cells to grow in nutrient-poor tumors. Through genetic screens in defined nutrient conditions, we characterized LYSET, a transmembrane protein (TMEM251) selectively required when cells consume extracellular proteins. LYSET was found to associate in the Golgi with GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which targets catabolic enzymes to lysosomes through mannose-6-phosphate modification. Without LYSET, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase was unstable because of a hydrophilic transmembrane domain. Consequently, LYSET-deficient cells were depleted of lysosomal enzymes and impaired in turnover of macropinocytic and autophagic cargoes. Thus, LYSET represents a core component of the lysosomal enzyme trafficking pathway, underlies the pathomechanism for hereditary lysosomal storage disorders, and may represent a target to suppress metabolic adaptations in cancer.
