### Title
Proteomic analysis of the aggregated proteins in cerebral vessles from MYPT1SMKO mice

### Description
To comprehensively understand the mechanism by which MYPT1 modulates the phenotypic switching of VSMCs after ischemic stroke, the proteins of cortical small vessel from MYPT1SMKO and WT mice subjected to MCAO or sham group were collected for proteomic screening.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins of cortical arterioles were prepared immediately after cortical vessel collection.After trypsin digestion, the peptides were desalted with a Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex) and vacuum-dried. The peptides were reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB and processed according to the protocol of the TMT kit/iTRAQ kit (Thermo Fisher).

### Data Protocol
he tryptic peptides were fractionated by high pH reverse-phase HPLC using a Thermo Betasil C18 column (5 Î¼m particles, 10 mm ID, 250 mm long). The peptides were subjected to a nanospray ionization (NSI) source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with a Q ExactiveTM Plus mass spectrophotometer (Thermo) coupled online to the UPLC. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using the MaxQuant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of overlapping differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was conducted with InterProScan, the KEGG database and the STRING database version 10.1.
