### Title
Proteomic analysis of  seed germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

### Description
In this study, we performed the first dynamic proteome analysis of wheat seed germination using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based proteomic approach. A total of 166 differentially expressed protein (DEP) spots representing 73 unique proteins were identified.

### Sample Protocol
Elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L.) Jimai 20 was used in this study. Seeds with similar size and weight were selected, and were washed with distilled water three times. Wheat germination was triggered by seed imbibition, according to seed imbibition time and morphological characteristics. Seed samples with three biological replicates were collected at 0 hours after imbibition (HAI, dry seeds), 12 HAI (seeds were soaked in water for 12 h), 24 HAI (radicles were about to emerge), 36 HAI (radicles come up to half of seed), and 48 HAI (germs become green). Collected samples were stored at -80oC prior to analysis.

### Data Protocol
Protein spots with statistically significant 2-fold or greater differences in abundance between samples were determined with Student’s t-test (p < 0.05). Differentially expressed protein (DEP) spots were excised from gels, and identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS). Tryptic peptides were analyzed with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (SM, Shimadzu Biotech, Kyoto, Japan). Subsequent identifications were performed using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). Spectra were acquired in a positive reflectron mode. The calibration mixtures (Applied Biosystems) were used to calibrate the spectrum to a mass tolerance within 0.1 Da. The parameters for database searching were peptide tolerance of 0.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance of 0.3 Da; one missed cleavages; variable modifications of Carbamidomethyl (Cys), oxidation (Met). GPS Explorer™software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystem) was used to create and search files against the NCBI nonredundant green plant database. All the proteins identified have MASCOT report total ion scores greater than 42 and identification probabilities of more than 95%. Phosphorylated protein spots detected by Pro-Q Diamond were selected and collected from gels. After digested, they were further identified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).For MS analyses, peptides were resuspended in 0.1% FA and analyzed by LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online to an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the data-dependent mode. The sample was trapped on a 150μm×0.5mm precolumn and eluted to an analytical 75μm × 150 mm column. Peptides were separated by a linear gradient formed by 2% ACN, 0.1% FA (mobile phase A) and 98% ACN, 0.1% FA (mobile phase B), from 3 to 30% of mobile phase B in 90 min. The mass spectrometer was operated with full scan acquisition in the Orbitrap at 24,000 resolutions (350–1800 m/z). The mass spectrometer was operated acquiring CID MS/MS scans after each MS1 scan on the 25 most abundant ions with MSA central losses of m/z 98, 49, and 32.6. With regard to the identification of phosphorylated proteins, we also identified the 2-D spots just with MALDI-TOF/TOF as the other proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the oldest cultivated crops and the second most important food crop in the world. Seed germination is the key developmental process in plant growth and development, and poor germination directly affects plant growth and subsequent grain yield. In this study, we performed the first dynamic proteome analysis of wheat seed germination using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based proteomic approach. A total of 166 differentially expressed protein (DEP) spots representing 73 unique proteins were identified, which are mainly involved in storage, stress/defense/detoxification, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, cell metabolism, and transcription/translation/transposition. The identified DEPs and their dynamic expression profiles generally correspond to three distinct seed germination phases after imbibition: storage degradation, physiological processes/morphogenesis, and photosynthesis. Some key DEPs involved in storage substance degradation and plant defense mechanisms, such as globulin 3, sucrose synthase type I, serpin, beta-amylase, and plastid ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) small subunit, were found to be phosphorylated during seed germination. Particularly, the phosphorylation site Ser(355) was found to be located in the enzyme active region of beta-amylase, which promotes substrate binding. Phosphorylated modification of several proteins could promote storage substance degradation and environmental stress defense during seed germination. The central metabolic pathways involved in wheat seed germination are proposed herein, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cereal seed germination.
