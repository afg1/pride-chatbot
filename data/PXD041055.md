### Title
In vivo characterization of a podocyte-expressed short podocin isoform

### Description
The most common genetic causes of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) are mutations in the NPHS2 gene, which encodes the lipid-binding protein podocin. Mass spectrometry and cDNA sequencing revealed the existence of a second shorter isoform in the human kidney in addition to the well-studied canonical full-length protein. Distinct subcellular localization of the shorter isoform that lacks part of the conserved PHB domain suggested a physiological role. Here we analyzed whether this protein can substitute for the canonical full-length protein. The short isoform of podocin is not found in other organisms except humans. We therefore now analysed a mouse line expressing the equivalent podocin isoform (podocinΔexon5) by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. We characterized the phenotype of these mice expressing podocinΔexon5 and used targeted mass spectrometry and qPCR to compare protein and RNA levels of podocinwildtype and podocinΔexon. After immunolabeling slit diaphragm components, STED microscopy was applied to visualize alterations of the podocytes’ foot process morphology. Mice homozygous for podocinΔexon5 were born heavily albuminuric and did not survive past the first 24 hours after birth. Targeted mass spectrometry revealed massively decreased protein levels of podocinΔexon5, whereas RNA abundance was not different from the canonical form of podocin. STED microscopy revealed the complete absence of podocin at the podocytes’ slit diaphragm and severe morphological alterations of podocyte foot processes. Mice heterozygous for podocinΔexon5 were phenotypically and morphologically unaffected despite decreased podocin and nephrin protein levels.The murine equivalent to the human short isoform of podocin cannot stabilize the lipid-protein complex at the podocyte slit diaphragm. Reduction of podocin levels at the site of the slit diaphragm complex has a detrimental effect on podocyte function and morphology. It is associated with decreased protein abundance of nephrin, the central component of the filtration-slit forming slit diaphragm protein complex.

### Sample Protocol
One half of kidney per mouse at P 0 (= day of birth) was processed for mass spectrometry. Samples were homogenized in 550 µl urea buffer 8 M containing 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, placed in a bioruptor for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 60 minutes at 20.000 x g and 4°C. 10 µl supernatant per sample was used the protein concentration in each sample. For reduction and alkylation, respectively, the remaining supernatant was incubated in 10mM DTT and 50 mM CAA for 60 minutes at room temperature each. After this, 50 µg protein per sample was digested with 1 µg Trypsin at room temperature overnight. After acidic elution of the pepites, a stage-tip clean-up protocol was performed as previously described [Rappsilber, J., Ishihama, Y. & Mann, M. Stop and Go Extraction Tips for Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization, Nanoelectrospray, and LC/MS Sample Pretreatment in Proteomics. Anal. Chem. 75, 663–670 (2003)].

### Data Protocol
Samples were measured on a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy-nLC 1200 (both Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on a self-packed C18 column (50 cm length, 75 µm inner diameter) on the following gradient running 0.1 % formic acid (buffer A) against 80 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid (buffer B) at a constant flow of 250 nl/min: initial 4 % B, up to 29 % B in 42 min, up to 55 % B in 8 min, up to 95 % B in 2 min, followed by column washing and recalibration. The mass spectrometer was operated in PRM mode with a resolution of 30,000, an AGC target of 2E5 and 200 ms maximum injection time. Isolation of peptides of interest was done in a 1 Th window with a 0.2 Th offset and fragmentation of them was performed at 35 normalized collision energy. Target peptides were afterwards analyzed in Skyline against a Prosit-simulated library [Gessulat et al. 2019 Nat. Methods, 10.1038/s41592-019-0426-7] and only peptides with the highest dotp were used to compare peptide abundances.

### Publication Abstract
The most common genetic causes of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) are mutations in the NPHS2 gene, which encodes the cholesterol-binding, lipid-raft associated protein podocin. Mass spectrometry and cDNA sequencing revealed the existence of a second shorter isoform in the human kidney in addition to the well-studied canonical full-length protein. Distinct subcellular localization of the shorter isoform that lacks part of the conserved PHB domain suggested a physiological role. Here, we analyzed whether this protein can substitute for the canonical full-length protein. The short isoform of podocin is not found in other organisms except humans. We therefore analysed a mouse line expressing the equivalent podocin isoform (podocin<sup>&#x394;exon5</sup>) by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. We characterized the phenotype of these mice expressing podocin<sup>&#x394;exon5</sup> and used targeted mass spectrometry and qPCR to compare protein and mRNA levels of podocin<sup>wildtype</sup> and podocin<sup>&#x394;exon5</sup>. After immunolabeling slit diaphragm components, STED microscopy was applied to visualize alterations of the podocytes' foot process morphology.Mice homozygous for podocin<sup>&#x394;exon5</sup> were born heavily albuminuric and did not survive past the first 24&#xa0;h after birth.
