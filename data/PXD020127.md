### Title
DIA based HCP detection in protein A purified IgG1

### Description
Detection and quantitation of host cell proteins in monoclonal antibody drug products using automated sample preparation and data independent acquisition LC-MS/MS

### Sample Protocol
100 ug of protein A purified anti-IL8 IgG1 samples were digested using Thermo Fisher Scientific's SMART digest trypsin kit as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Following digestion, disulphide bonds were reduced and alkylated using DTT and IAA, respectively. Hi3 Phos B standard was added to the samples to obtain a final concentration of 3 pmol on column.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed using Progenesis QI version 2.2. Generated ion intensity maps were used for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer 2.1. Database searching was performed using SequestHT against a Cricetulus Griseus database appended with the sequence of the HI3 standard.
