### Title
The HDAC inhibitor SAHA regulates CBX2 stability via a SUMO-triggered ubiquitin-mediated pathway in leukemia

### Description
Leukemias are characterized by bone marrow failure due to oncogenic mutations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or blood precursor cells. HSC differentiation and self-renewal properties are tightly regulated by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, a well-characterized family of transcriptional epigenetic regulators. PcG proteins form two canonical complexes: Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1),  and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).CBX proteins link the activity of PRC1 with PRC2, serving as critical regulators of PcG-mediating activity. While the functional role of some CBX proteins in cancer has been largely explored, recent reports support the specific role of CBX2 in human tumors, thus it represent a promising new target for anti-cancer strategies. To date, chromodomain inhibitors have been identified for CBX7 , but no molecules inhibiting CBX2 have been described. Nevertheless, different chromatin-modulating drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are reported to regulate CBX2 targets on chromatin, suggesting that HDACi might be used to indirectly modulate aberrant effects of CBX2 in cancer. We describe a novel SAHA-mediated mechanism of CBX2 post-translational regulation. We found that CBX2 undergoes SAHA-induced SUMO2/3 modification and that CBX2 SUMOylation promotes its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. We also identified the specific molecular pathway and key players regulating CBX2 stability, demonstrating that CBX4 and RNF4 act as the E3 SUMO and E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively. Additionally, CBX2-depleted leukemic cells display impaired proliferation, showing that CBX2 is required for leukemia cell clonogenicity. Our study provides the first evidence of a non-canonical SAHA-mediated anti-tumorigenic activity via CBX2 SUMOylation and degradation

### Sample Protocol
HeLa expressing GFP-CBX2 and wild-type HeLa cells were harvested and homogenized using a tight pestle in the presence of 0.15% NP-40 (Roche) and complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Then samples were incubated in hypotonic buffer. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and incubated with lysis buffer (420mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 and complete protease inhibitors) for 1h to extract nuclear proteins. The nuclear extract was obtained by a final centrifugation step at 13.000RPM for 30min at 4C. The GFP-CBX2 HeLa and HeLa WT nuclear extracts were subjected to GFP-affinity enrichment using GFP-trap beads (Chromotek). For each pull-down, 1mg of nuclear extract was incubated with 15 ul beads in incubation buffer (300mM NaCl, 0.15% NP-40, 0.5mM DDT, 20mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.9)) containing ethidium bromide at a final concentration of 50mg/ml. Ethidium bromide was added to the reaction to prevent indirect, DNA-mediated interactions. Beads were then washed two times with incubation buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, two times with PBS containing 0.5% NP-40 and finally two times with PBS. Precipitated proteins were subjected to on-bead trypsin digestion. 50ul of elution buffer (2M Urea, 10mM DTT and 50mM Tris– HCl pH 7.5) was added to the beads in order to partially denature the proteins. After incubation, for 20min at RT in a thermoshaker, the supernatant was collected in a separate tube and iodoacetamide (IAA)(Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 50mM. The beads were then incubated with 50ul of elution buffer containing 50mM IAA instead of DTT for 10 min at RT.  Proteins on the beads were then partially digested from the beads by adding 0.25mg trypsin (Promega) for 2h at RT in a thermoshaker. The supernatant was then collected and added to the first supernatant. A total of 0.1mg of fresh trypsin was added and proteins were digested overnight at RT. Tryptic peptides were finally acidified and desalted using Stagetips prior to mass spectrometry analyses. After elution from the Stagetips, the tryptic peptides were applied to online nanoLC-MS/MS, using a 120-min gradient from 7% until 32% acetonitril followed by stepwise increases up to 95% acetonitril. Mass spectra were recorded on a LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), selecting the 15 most intense precursor ions of every full scan for fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.2.2.5) using standard settings with the additional options match between runs, LFQ and iBAQ selected. The generated “proteingroups.txt” table was filtered for contaminants, reverse hits, number of unique peptides (>0) and number of peptides (>1) in Perseus (from MaxQuant package). For interactor identification, the logarithm (log2) of the LFQ values were taken, resulting in a Gaussian distribution of the data. This allowed imputation of missing values by normal distribution (width=0.3, shift=1.8), assuming these proteins were close to the detection limit. Statistical outliers for the GFP pull-down of the GFP-CBX2 HeLa compared to HeLa WT were then determined using two-tailed t-test. Multiple testing correction was applied by using a permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) method in Perseus.
