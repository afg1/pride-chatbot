### Title
Proteome profiling reveals key insights about the mechanisms under low-temperature stress in sea buckthorn

### Description
Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is well adapted to extreme temperatures ranging from −43 to 40°C and is ideal material to study mechanisms related to low-temperature stress tolerance

### Sample Protocol
Under the low-temperature treatments 7 d and 14 d, samples taken at 7 and 14 d were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for further studies.

### Data Protocol
Total proteins quantified using the Bradford method. 2D-DIGE were performed to separate peptides.
