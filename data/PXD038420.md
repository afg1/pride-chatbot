### Title
Different proteins expression were dectected by iTRAQ assay in NGB/HCT116 and Vector/HCT116

### Description
Different proteins expression were dectected by iTRAQ assay in HCT116 cell line over-expression NGB or not.

### Sample Protocol
1)NGB stable cell construction; 2)Quality control of protein extraction (Bradford quantification, SDS-PAGE);3)Protein digestion;4)Peptide labeling;5)Peptide fractionation;5)HPLC；6）Mass Spectrometry Detection

### Data Protocol
After getting raw data, we will do each bioinformitics analysis as the client appoints on contract. Figure4 demonstrates a complete pipeline for iTRAQ (Quantification) project.The raw MS/MS data is converted into MGF format by the corresponding tool, and the exported MGF files are searched by the local Mascot server against the database described above. In addition, quality control (QC) is performed to determine if a reanalysis step is needed. An automated software, named IQuant, was applied to the quantification of proteins. All the proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1% will proceed with downstream analysis including GO, COG/KOG and Pathway. Further, we also can perform deep analysis based on differentially expressed proteins, including Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, COG/KOG function annotation, cluster analysis, protein interaction analysis and subcellular localization analysis.
