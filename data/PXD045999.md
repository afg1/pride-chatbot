### Title
Black, red and white: characterization of painting materials on a group of Bwa masks from Burkina Faso, proteomics

### Description
The distinctive and visually striking wooden masks associated with the Bwa culture in Burkina Faso, West Africa, are carved from a soft wood into different shapes and display various geometrical patterns and symbols according to the purpose. One of their characteristic features is the use of the colors black, red and white, which evoke the three major rivers crossing the country: the Black, Red and White Voltas. According to published accounts of scholars who have worked directly with the artists, the materials used to obtain these colors include reptile excrement for the white, iron-rich stones powdered and mixed with egg or plant gums for the red, and boiled Acacia seed pods for the black, as well as modern materials such as enamel paint in some cases. A group of four Bwa masks in the Arts of Africa collection of the Art Institute of Chicago was investigated using a complement of analytical techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry, and mass spectrometry based proteomics to characterize their painting materials. The results obtained corroborate the published accounts, while also providing new insights into the nature of the coloring materials and the selection and substitution of pigments and binders. These findings highlight the complementary value of scientific research, in combination with field work and artists’ accounts, to generate a fuller understanding and appreciation of this traditional artistic practice.

### Sample Protocol
Each sample was incubated in 100 μL of an aqueous buffer containing guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) 2 M, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine 10 mM, chloroacetamide 20 mM, and Tris 100 mM, for 3 hours at 80 °C. A first digestion was performed by incubating the samples for 2 hours at 37 °C with 0.2 μg rLysC (Promega, Sweden). The solution was diluted to a final concentration of 0.6 M by adding a Tris 25 mM in 10% acetonitrile (ACN) solution, and samples were digested with 0.8 μg trypsin (Promega, Sweden) overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was recovered after centrifugation, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 100 μL of 5% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA) and the pH adjusted to 2 by adding FA. Peptides were desalted on C18 spin columns (Pierce), dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 30 μL of 5% ACN/0.1% FA prior to analysis. The extracted peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a DionexUltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation nano LC coupled to a Q Exactive HF (QE) Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, San Jose, CA). 2 μL of the peptide solution was loaded onto a trap column, 150 μm × 3 cm in-house packed with 3 μm ReproSil-Pur® beads (New Objective, Inc. Woburn, MA), followed by the analytical column (75 μm × 10.5 cm PicoChip column packed with 3 μm ReproSil-Pur® beads). The flow rate was 300 nL min−1, solvent A was 0.1% FA in water and solvent B was 0.1% FA in ACN. Peptides were separated on a 120 min analytical gradient from 5% ACN/0.1% FA to 40% ACN/0.1% FA. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, source voltage was 2.40 kV and the capillary temperature was kept 275 °C. MS1 scans were acquired from 375–2000 m/z at 60 000 resolving power and automatic gain control (AGC) set to 1 × 106. The top fifteen most abundant precursor ions in each MS1 scan were selected for fragmentation in the ion trap. Precursors were selected with an isolation width of 1 m/z and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation at 30% normalized collision energy. Previously selected ions were dynamically excluded from re-selection for 60 seconds. The MS2 AGC was set to 3 × 105.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed with the MaxQuant software [8] version 2.0.3.0. Peptides spectra were first searched against a wide database (SwissProt from Uniprot, January 2017) [9]. Following these results, MS/MS spectra were searched against more restricted databases: peptides from the red paint samples were searched against a database including all the birds under the order Galliformes (downloaded from Uniprot, April 2023), while peptides from the white paint sample S3 from mask #1958.116  were searched against different databases containing protein sequences from birds (infraclass Neognathae), snakes (infraorder Serpentes) and iguana lizards (family Agamidae) (downloaded from Uniprot, February 2023). The database search was performed by setting the following modifications: carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modification; methionine (C) oxidation, deamidation of glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N), conversion of N-terminal Q and glutamic acid (E) to pyroglutamic acid (pyro-E) as variable modifications. Trypsin was set as the digestion enzyme. Peptides were searched with maximum two missed cleavages, minimum peptide length was set at 7, minimum score for both modified and unmodified peptides set to 40 and protein false discovery rate (FDR) set at 1. The contamination.fasta provided by MaxQuant, which includes common laboratory contaminants (“MaxQuant Downloads -contaminants.fasta” - http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:start_downloads.htm), was used to assess contaminant proteins, which were omitted from further analysis. Proteins were considered as confidently identified when two unique and non-overlapping peptides were at least observed, unless differently specified. Each peptide was searched against the entire NCBI protein database using the pBLAST alignment tool [10] and considered species-specific only when it could be assigned to a single species, or a limited number of species among which only one could be probable, depending on the geographical origin and date of the material investigated. A different taxonomic category above the species level  (e.g. genus, family etc.) was reported when species specificity was not available.
