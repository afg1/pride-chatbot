### Title
Calcitriol promotes differentiation of glioma stem-like cells and increases their susceptibility to temozolomide

### Description
Cancer cells with a stem-like phenotype are commonly described in glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain cancer, that are thought to be highly tumorigenic. This phenotype comprimes high self renewal capacity and resistance against chemotherapy and radiation therapy, thereby promoting tumor progression and disease relapse. Here we show for the first time that calcitriol, the hormonally active form of the “sun hormone” vitamin D3, effectively suppresses stemness properties in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), supporting the hypothesis that cal-citriol sensitizes them to additional chemotherapy. Indeed, a physiologically relevant organotypic brain slice model was used to monitor tumor growth of GSCs and the effectiveness of combined treatment with temozolomide, the current standard-of-care, and calcitriol was proven. These findings indicate that further research on applying calcitriol, a well known and safe drug, as a potential adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma is both justified and necessary.

### Sample Protocol
Peptides were resuspended in 3% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid and separated on an Easy nLC 1200 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and a 22 cm long, 75 μm ID fused-silica col-umn, which had been packed in house with 1.9 μm C18 particles (ReproSil-Pur, Dr. Maisch), and kept at 45°C using an integrated column oven (Sonation). Peptides were eluted by a non-linear gradient from 5%–60% acetonitrile over 155 min and directly sprayed into a Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoFlex ion source (ThermoFisher Scientific) at a spray voltage of 2.3 kV {Hosp, 2015 #2885}{Kelstrup, 2012 #2823}. For analysis 1/10 of each fraction was loaded onto the column. Each analysis used the Multi-Notch MS3-based TMT method {McAlister, 2014 #2886} to reduce ion in-terference compared to MS2 quantification {Paulo, 2016 #2887}. The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum (Orbitrap analysis; resolution 120,000 at 200 Th; mass range 350-1400 m/z; automatic gain control (AGC) target 400000; normalized AGC target 100%; maximum injection time 100 ms). Precursors for MS2 analysis were selected using 10 ms activation time method. MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced dissociation (quad-rupole ion trap analysis; Turbo scan rate; AGC 15000; normalized AGC target 150%; iso-lation window 0.7 Th; normalized collision energy (NCE) 35; maximum injection time 50 ms). Monoisotopic peak assignment was used and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (150 s ± 7 ppm) and dependent scans were per- formed on a single charge state per precursor. Following acquisition of each MS2 spec-trum, a synchronous-precursor-selection (SPS) MS3 scan was collected on the top 10 most intense ions in the MS2 spectrum {McAlister, 2014 #2886}. MS3 precursors were frag-mented by high energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) and analyzed using the Or-bitrap (NCE 65; AGC 100000; normalized AGC target 200%; maximum injection time 150 ms, resolution was 15,000 at 200 Th).

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and SequenceHT node was selected for database searches. Human trypsin digested pro-teome (Homo sapiens SwissProt database [TaxID:9606, version 2020-03-12]) was used for protein identifications. Contaminants (MaxQuant "contamination.fasta") were determined for quality control. TMT6 (+229.163) at the N-terminus, TMT6 (K, +229.163) at lysine and carbamidomethyl (+57.021) at cysteine residues were set as fixed modifications. Methio-nine oxidation (M, +15.995) and acetylation (+42.011) at the protein N-terminus were set for dynamic modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. Default Percolator settings in PD were used to filter perfect spectrum matches (PSMs). Reporter ion quantification was achieved with default settings in consensus workflow. Protein file from PD was then exported to Excel for further pro-cessing. Normalized abundances from protein file were used for statistical analysis after contaminations and complete empty values removed. Significantly altered proteins were determined by a two-sided, unpaired Student`s t-test (p-value < 0.05) adding minimum fold-change cut-off (> = 0.5) with R version 4.0.2 in RStudio. Gplots version 3.1.1  was used to visualize heatmaps and EnhancedVolcano version 1.6.0 was used for volcano plot. Figures later then edited with Adobe Illustrator CS5.
