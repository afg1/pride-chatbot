### Title
Human Brain LC-MS/MS -  Dementia-linked amyloidosis is associated with brain protein deamidation as revealed by proteomic profiling of human brain tissues

### Description
Brian Protein Deamidation Associated with Amyloidosis Revealed by Soluble and Amyloidal Brian Proteome Profiling

### Sample Protocol
Post-mortem brain samples of 69-year-old male diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and dementia obtained from Fukushimura Brain Bank, Japan, were used in this study. The brain tissue was dissected, large blood vessels were removed, cut into small pieces and homogenized. In control experiment, we used 12.5 ml of ice cold homogenization buffer [(2% (w/v) SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4)] supplemented with Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail. However, processing protein sample at mild acidic condition minimizes deamidation artifact and also eliminates false positive identification [13], therefore, in another experiment, proteins were extracted using 2% SDS, 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. After homogenization,  cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 10 ºC for 10 min and filtrate was ultracentrifuge at 112000×g, 10 ºC for 1 h. The collected supernatant was further ultracentrifuged twice at 112000×g 10 ºC for 1 h. The pellet portion enriched with amyloidal proteins from the two ultracentrifugation steps was combined and resuspended in 12.5 ml of 2% SDS in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, mixed and ultracentrifuged at 112000 ×g, 10 ºC for 1 h. The supernatant was combined together with supernatants from previous steps for analysis. The pellet containing the insoluble amyloidal plaque was resuspended in 1 ml 70% formic acid (FA), vortexed for 2 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 18000×g, 4 °C. To dissolve completely, obtained pellet was resuspended in 1 ml 99 % formic acid, vortex for 2 min, and centrifuged at 18,000 ×g, 4 °C.

### Data Protocol
Label free quantitation (LFQ) method in Mascot uses emPAI [14] which is based on spectral counting while LFQ in Maxquant is based on the ion intensities of extracted ion chromatogram .  The raw data files of the soluble and aggregated protein fractions were searched with MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) as described above. In brief, standard search type was used with LFQ enabled for protein quantitation. For first main search, peptide mass tolerance were 20 ppm and 4.5 ppm respectively, while for MS/MS it was 20 ppm with FTMS de-isotoping enabled. Carbamidomethylation (C) was fixed modification while oxidation and deamidation were variable modifications. The search was performed in revert decoy mode with PSM FDR, protein FDR and site decoy fraction set at 0.01.
