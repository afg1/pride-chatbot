### Title
Identification of protective antigens by exploring the natural niche of Streptococcus pneumoniae

### Description
Proteome analysis of two S. pneumoniae strains grown in standardized chemically defined medium (CDM) and in CDM adapted to the human host in regard to infection related conditions (IVM)

### Sample Protocol
Two S. pneumoniae strains were cultivated in CDM or IVMCDM with adapted metall ion concentrations until late exponential phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and  disrupted with 8M urea-2M thiourea buffer. Protein concentrations were determined and after tryptic digestion, peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data were analysed using Proteome discoverer 2.2 against a Uniprot database limited to S. pneumoniae Tigr4 entries (03/2017).
