### Title
N-terminome analysis of tomato P69D knock-out mutant total leaf proteomes treated with and without recominant P69D

### Description
The intercellular space or apoplast constitutes the main interface in plant-pathogen interactions. Apoplastic subtilisin-like proteases -subtilases- may play an important role in defence and they have been identified as targets of pathogen-secreted effector proteins. However, most evidence is limited to the interaction of plants with non-vascular foliar pathogens. Here, we characterise the role of the Solanaceae-specific P69 subtilase family in the interaction between tomato and the vascular bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.

### Sample Protocol
The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) resistant line Hawaii 7996 and a CRISPR/Cas9 mutant line of P69D in the Hawaii7996 background were grown in controlled growth chambers at 60% humidity, 12h:12h, day:night and 27°C (light-emitting diode (LED) lighting) or 25°C (fluorescent lighting). Total leaf proteomes were isolated under native conditions with 1M HEPES, 5mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5uM E-64d, 1uM Pepstatin A, pH 7,5.  Recominant P69D was added at a proteome:enzyme ratio of 1:200 and incubated for 1h at 25°C. The proteomes were then purified by chloroform/methanol precipitation, denatured in 6M guanidine buffered with 100 mM HEPES to pH7.2, cysteine residues reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 30 mM IAA. HUNTER N-terminome analyses were performed as described in Demir et al. 2022 Methods Mol Biol. Briefly, free primary amines at the protein N-termini and lysine side chains were differentially stable isotope-labelled by reductive dimethylation, using the light isotopes for control-treated samples(20 mM CH2O and 20 mM NaBH3CN, +28.0313 Da) and heavy isotope for samples incubated with P69D (20 mM 13CD2O and 20 mM NaBH3CN, +34.0631 Da) for the in vivo experiment. Proteins were then digested with trypsin and new peptide alpha-amines generated by the tryptic digest modified with undecanal. N-terminal peptides were then selectively enriched by depletion of the undecanal-modified peptides using HRX reverse phase cartridges (Macherey and Nagel). Enriched N-terminal peptides were desalted with SDP-RPS STAGE tips. Peptides were analysed using an UltiMate 3000 RSCL nano-HPLC system (Thermo) online coupled to an Impact II Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) via a CaptiveSpray ion source boosted with an ACN-saturated nitrogen gas stream. Peptides were loaded on a µPAC pillar array trap column (1 cm length, PharmaFluidics) and separated on a µPAC pillar array analytical column (50 cm flowpath, PharmaFluidics) using a 2 h elution protocol that included an 80 min separation gradient from 5% to 35% solvent B (solvent A: H2O+0.1% FA, solvent B: ACN+0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 nl min–1 at 60 °C. Line-mode MS spectra were acquired in mass range 200–1400 m/z with a Top14 method.

### Data Protocol
Acquired tandem mass spectra were queried with MaxQuant v.2.0.3 against a database consisting of the UniProt R. solanacearum database (release 2022_04) and the Uniprot Solanum lycopersicum database (release 2023_03), with the 7 entries A0A3Q7HVI0; A0A3Q7HTM2; A0A3Q7HVI4; A0A3Q7F3D9; A0A3Q7HHX1; A0A3Q7HI18; A0A3Q7HKM1 (incorrect annotations of P69 sequences) replaced by the eight P69 sequences downloaded from the Solanaceae Genomics Network (see above) and entry A0A3Q7HXW1 (incorrect annotation of PR1 proteins as fusion protein) removed and replaced by manually annotated PR1 protein homolog sequences (12 entries). Search settings were semispecific (free Nterm) digestion with ArgC, duplex dimethyl labeling of Lys residues and N-termini, Cys carbamidomethlyation was set as fixed modification, N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal pyro-Glutamate formation from Gln or Glu and variable Met oxidation considered as variable modifications. All other settings used standard MaxQuant settings for Bruker Q-TOF instruments, MaxQuant results further analysed using MANTI v5.4.

### Publication Abstract
The intercellular space or apoplast constitutes the main interface in plant-pathogen interactions. Apoplastic subtilisin-like proteases-subtilases-may play an important role in defence and they have been identified as targets of pathogen-secreted effector proteins. Here, we characterise the role of the Solanaceae-specific P69 subtilase family in the interaction between tomato and the vascular bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. R. solanacearum infection post-translationally activated several tomato P69s. Among them, P69D was exclusively activated in tomato plants resistant to R. solanacearum. In vitro experiments showed that P69D activation by prodomain removal occurred in an autocatalytic and intramolecular reaction that does not rely on the residue upstream of the processing site. Importantly P69D-deficient tomato plants were more susceptible to bacterial wilt and transient expression of P69B, D and G in Nicotiana benthamiana limited proliferation of R. solanacearum. Our study demonstrates that P69s have conserved features but diverse functions in tomato and that P69D is involved in resistance to R. solanacearum but not to other vascular pathogens like Fusarium oxysporum.
