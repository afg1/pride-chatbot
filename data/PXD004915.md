### Title
RPE-1 and RPE-1 trisomic AHA p-c and steady state data

### Description
We developed a pulse-chase method in where fully SILAC (heavy, medium-heavy and Light) labelled cells were pulsed with Azidohomoalanine (AHA) and then chased for different length of times. In addition, steady state protein levels comparing the RPE- and RPE-1 trisomic cells by standard SILAC labeling was also acquired. These datasets contain data for the human RPE-1 and RPE-1 trisomic cell lines.

### Sample Protocol
AHA labelled cells where lyzed and newly synthesized proteins were enriched by click chemistry covalently linking the AHA-bearing proteins to alkyne-agarose beads. After stringent washing proteins where digested "on bead" by Lys-C and trypsin. Peptides where SCX fractionated before being separated on a HPLC system and analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Denatured and alkylated proteins from standard SILAC experiments were precipitated by Wessel-Flügge precipitation.  Protein pellets were re-suspended in Urea buffer and digested by Lys-C and trypsin. Resulting peptides were separated on a 15 cm column packed with C18 material before being analyzed on a Q-Exactive.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.5.1.2. Default settings were kept except that `match between runs` was turned on. Lys8, Arg10, Lys4, Arg6 were set as labels for the AHA p-c data and only Lys8 and Arg10 for the steady state measurements. Oxidation of methionines, n-terminal acetylation and deamidation of aspargine and glutamine residues were defined as variable modifications. Carbamidomethyl of c-termini was set as fixed modification. The in silico digests of the human Uniprot database (2014-10) was done with Trypsin/P. The false discovery rate was set to 1 % and both peptide and protein level.

### Publication Abstract
Do young and old protein molecules have the same probability to be degraded? We addressed this question using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry to obtain degradation profiles for thousands of proteins. We find that&#xa0;&gt;10% of proteins are degraded non-exponentially. Specifically, proteins are less stable in the first few hours of their life and stabilize with age. Degradation profiles are conserved and similar in two cell types. Many non-exponentially degraded (NED) proteins are subunits of complexes that are produced in&#xa0;super-stoichiometric amounts relative to their exponentially degraded (ED) counterparts. Within complexes, NED proteins have larger interaction interfaces and assemble earlier than ED subunits. Amplifying genes encoding NED proteins increases their initial degradation. Consistently, decay profiles can predict protein level attenuation in aneuploid cells. Together, our data show that non-exponential degradation is common, conserved, and has important consequences for complex formation and regulation of protein abundance.
