### Title
LC-MS/MS identification of interactors of the plant natriuretic peptide, AtPNP-A

### Description
Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) comprise a class of systemically mobile molecules functioning as hormonal regulators of ion and fluid balance. Since the molecular mode of action of PNPs remains unclear, a large-scale protein-protein interaction study has been undertaken to identify interactors of the model PNP present in Arabidopsis thaliana, termed AtPNP-A.

### Sample Protocol
Protoplasts isolated from wild-type (Col-0) A. thaliana plants were treated with biologically active biotinylated synthetic AtPNP-A peptide (pAtPNP-A; GenScript) in the presence or absence of 3,3'-dithiobis[sulfoccinimidylpropionate (DTSSP; Thermo Scientific) or with biotin in the presence of the crosslinking agent (control). Upon 1h incubation on ice the reactions were termianted, protoplasts were lysed, and affinity-based separation of the interactors was performed with streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen). Proteins eluted under denaturing conditions were separated on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin and subsequent LC-MS/MS analyses on Linear Trap Quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Data were recorded with the Xcalibur software (version 2.1; Thermo Scientific) and converted from 'raw' to 'mgf' with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.2.0.208; Thermo Scientific). Peptides were matched to the  Arabidopsis_TAIR10 protein database using MASCOT search engine (version 2.4.0; Matrix Science). Only proteins identified with high (at least 99%; FDR < 0.1%) confidence based on at least two unique peptides were subjected to relative quantification and a comparative analysis between the samples containing pAtPNP-A and crosslinker or AtPNP-A only, and between the control, using Scaffold 4 (version 4.10.0; Proteome Software).

### Publication Abstract
Interactors of the plant natriuretic peptide present in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, termed AtPNP-A, were affinity-based isolated from <i>A. thaliana</i> (Col-0) leaf mesophyll cell protoplasts by incubating the protoplasts with biologically active biotinylated peptide corresponding to amino acid sequence of the active site of AtPNP-A (pAtPNP-A), either in the presence or absence of a cross-linking agent, 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP), or with equimolar amount of biotin with DTSSP (negative control). Upon biotin/streptavidin-based isolation of proteins bound to the pAtPNP-A or biotin, the proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), digested with trypsin and subjected to identification with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Label-free quantification of identified proteins allowed identification of binding partners of AtPNP-A, paving the way for pinpointing novel signal transduction pathways AtPNP-A is involved in. The raw and processed LC-MS/MS data reported in this article have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD017925.
