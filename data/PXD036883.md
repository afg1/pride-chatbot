### Title
Mass spectrometry-based analysis of Muse cells from different origins

### Description
Multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells are nontumorigenic endogenous pluripotent-like stem cells easily collected from various adult or fetal tissues. The tissue regenerative effects of Muse cells have been demonstrated in many disease models, as they reach damaged sites after intravenous injection to exert pleiotropic effects.  Previous reports indicate that several human tissues are readily accessible for Muse cell isolation, including adult tissues such as bone marrow (BM) and embryonic tissues such as Wharton’s Jelly (WJ) from umbilical cord. Wa analyzed the protein repertoires of WJ-Muse and BM-Muse using mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Human adult bone marrow Mesenchymal Stem cells (BM-MSC) derived from healthy donors were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501). Human fetal MSC (WJ-MSC) were derived from Wharton’s jelly of umbilical cords (UC), obtained from normal full-term deliveries after maternal informed consent at Maternity unit from Bicêtre AP-HP Hospital (Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France). For Muse cell isolation, BM- or WJ-MSC were cultured at a 15,000 cells/cm2 density in a GibcoTM Low-glucose DMEM+GlutaMAX medium (#11570586, Fisher scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, #SH30071.03IH, HyCloneTM, Fisher scientific), 1 ng/ml human FGF-2 (#130-093-564, Miltenyi Biotec) and 0.1 mg/ml GibcoTM kanamycin sulfate (#11578876, Fisher scientific) at 37°C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells from passage 7 were used for Muse cell isolation. Three biological replicates (R1 to R3) of WJ-Muse and BM-Muse cells were analyzed. The proteins were directly solubilized in Laemmli buffer, heated for 10 min at 95°C and stacked in the top of a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). After staining with R-250 Coomassie Blue (Biorad), proteins were digested in-gel using trypsin (modified, sequencing purity, Promega). The resulting peptides were fractionated by tip-based strong cation exchange (3M Empore). For this, peptides were dissolved in 5% acetonitrile (ACN), 1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted in 4 fractions (F1: 100 mM ammonium acetate (AA), 20% ACN, 0.5 % formic acid (FA); F2: 175 mM AA, 20% ACN, 0.5 % FA; F3: 375 mM AA, 20% ACN, 0.5 % FA; F4: 80% ACN, 5% ammonium hydroxide) before desalting using C18 reverse phase chromatography (Ultra-Micro SpinColumns, Harvard Apparatus). NanoLC-MS/MS analyses of peptides eluted in each fraction were performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano coupled to a Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 240-min gradient. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 75 μm x 250 mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch). The MS and MS/MS data were acquired by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.6.0, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Uniprot database (Homo sapiens taxonomy, October 2019 version), a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (bovine albumin, keratins, trypsin, etc.), and the corresponding reversed databases. Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 ppm and 25 mmu. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable) and Oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 7 amino acids, peptide-spectrum-match score ≥ 25, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1% as calculated on peptide-spectrum-match scores by employing the reverse database strategy, and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group).
