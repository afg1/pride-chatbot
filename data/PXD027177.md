### Title
Proteomic analysis reveals low dose PARP inhibitor-induced differential protein expression in BRCA1-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells

### Description
To detect the off-target effects of PARP inhibition, a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis was conducted of a BRCA1-mutated HGSOC cell line treated with low doses of two PARPi, Niraparib and Rucaparib.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were resuspended in urea lysis buffer. For digestion, 50 µg of protein per sample was used for disulfide bond reduction with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 hour at 37 ºC and then alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The samples were diluted 1:4 with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and subsequently digested with Lys-C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 for 1 hour with shaking at room temperature, followed by trypsin digest at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 overnight with shaking at room temperature. The digestion reactions were acidified and quenched with 10% formic acid to a final concentration of 0.1% followed by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature.  The peptide samples were then desalted using 1cc C18 SepPak cartridges with a vacuum manifold (Waters). The eluates were dried using vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 prior to the measurement of peptide concentration with a BCA assay. The peptide samples were labeled with TMT-10plexTM Label Reagent set according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TMT 126 was used as a reference channel and TMT 127N, 128N, 128C, 129C, 130N, and 130C were used to label the four different conditions and their replicates: DMSO with replicate 129C and 128C, Niraparib with replicate 130C and 130N, Rucaparib with replicate 128N and 127N. Each TMT label was reconstituted in 52.5 µL of anhydrous acetonitrile and added at a concentration of 13.3 mM to 16 µg of peptide per sample for 1 hour at room temperature and then pooled, desalted, and dried using vacuum centrifugation. The TMT-labeled samples were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mM ammonium formate pH 10 in 98:2 water:acetonitrile) prior to high-pH reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation. A Shimadzu Prominance HPLC (Shimadzu) with a Hot Sleeve-25L Column Heater (Analytical Sales & Products, Inc.) was used with a Security Guard pre-column housing a Gemini NX C18 cartridge (Phenomenex) attached to a C18 XBridge column (5 µm particles, 2.1 mm ID, 150 mm length). The peptides were separated with a gradient of increasing buffer B (20 mM Ammonium formate, pH 10 in 10:90 water:acetonitrile) from 2-7% over 0.5 minutes, 7-15%  over 7.5 minutes, 15-35% over 45 minutes, and 35-60% over 15 minutes, all at a constant flow rate of 200 µL/min. Fractions were collected every 2 minutes and UV absorbances were monitored at 215 nm and 280 nm where peptide-containing fractions were divided into two equal numbered groups, “early” and “late”. A volume equal to 15 milli-absorbance unit of the first “early” fraction was concatenated with the first “late” fraction, and so on. The concatenated samples were then dried using vacuum centrifugation. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatography system (Dionex Ultimate 3000) coupled with an Orbitrap Fusion MS system (Thermo Fisher). The samples were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid and injected into a Luna C18 column (20 cm, 5 µm Phenomenex particles, 100 Å pores). Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a 10 µm spray tip (New Objective, ID 75µm, OD 360 µm, tip 10 um). The spray voltage was set to 2100 V. Peptides were separated using a gradient of buffer A (water and 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was as follows: 2-10% B over 6 minutes, 10-35% B over 84 minutes, 35-80% B over 4 minutes, at a constant flow rate of 0.3 µL/min. Data were acquired using a top 10 SPS MS3 method. MS1 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a scan range of 350-1800 m/z at a resolution of 120,000 and ions with charges 2+ to 7+ were selected for CID-based MS/MS fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30 seconds. MS3 fragmentation was conducted using HCD with a scan range of 100-500 m/z and a resolution of 30,000.

### Data Protocol
The MS data were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.5.0.400 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed with SEQUEST HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for protein identification using the following parameters: enzyme specificity:  trypsin;  maximum missed cleavage sites: 2; peptide and fragment mass tolerance: 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. A SwissProt human database downloaded on 11-23-2020 was used. Proteomic data were filtered based on the following parameters for proteins: high protein FDR confidence, grouped abundances in every sample: >0, ≥2 unique peptides per protein. The following parameters were set for peptide groups: confidence: high, grouped abundances in every sample: >0, PSM ambiguity: unambiguous, and each peptide group belongs to one protein group.

### Publication Abstract
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common form of ovarian cancer diagnosed in patients worldwide. Patients with <i>BRCA1/2</i>-mutated HGSOC have benefited from targeted treatments such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Despite the initial success of PARPi-based ovarian cancer treatment regimens, approximately 70% of patients with ovarian cancer relapse and the 5-year survival rate remains at 30%. PARPi exhibit variable treatment efficacy and toxicity profiles. Furthermore, the off-target effects of PARP inhibition have not yet been fully elucidated, warranting further study of these classes of molecules in the context of HGSOC treatment. Highly reproducible quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflows have been developed for the analysis of tumor tissues and cell lines. To detect the off-target effects of PARP inhibition, we conducted a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of a <i>BRCA1</i>-mutated HGSOC cell line treated with low doses of two PARPi, niraparib and rucaparib. Our goal was to identify PARPi-induced protein signaling pathway alterations toward a more comprehensive elucidation of the mechanism of action of PARPi beyond the DNA damage response pathway. A significant enrichment of nuclear and nucleoplasm proteins that are involved in protein binding was observed in the rucaparib-treated cells. Shared upregulated proteins between niraparib and rucaparib treatment demonstrated RNA II pol promoter-associated pathway enrichment in transcription regulation. Pathway enrichment analyses also revealed off-target effects in the Golgi apparatus and the ER. The results from our mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis highlights notable off-target effects produced by low-dose treatment of <i>BRCA1</i>-mutated HGSOC cells treated with rucaparib or niraparib.
