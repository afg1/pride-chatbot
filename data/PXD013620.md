### Title
The dynamics of Atm signalling dictate cellular fate decisions after DNA damage

### Description
DNA damage activates diverse cellular responses â€“ either protective or deleterious â€“that ultimately promote or inhibit proliferation. How the distinct responses conferring crucial cell fate decisions are chosen is unclear. Using a systems approach, we demonstrate that the dynamic features of Atm dependent DNA double-strand break (DSB) signalling response dictate cellular outcome. Combining temporal phosphoproteome and nascent transcriptome analyses after low or high DNA-damage-load, we discovered that some responses, such as Tp53 activation, have an activation threshold and others arise independently of DNA-damage-load. Using DSB repair deficient cells, we show that persistent DSBs alter the kinetics â€“ but not the amplitude â€“ of Atm signalling. Thus, we demonstrate that pathway choices are dictated by the signalling dynamics and hence cell fate decisions are responsive to DNA-damage-load and repair capacity of the cells.

### Publication Abstract
Cancer risk after ionizing radiation (IR) is assumed to be linear with the dose; however, for low doses, definite evidence is lacking. Here, using temporal multi-omic systems analyses after a low (LD; 0.1 Gy) or a high (HD; 1 Gy) dose of X-rays, we show that, although the DNA damage response (DDR) displayed dose proportionality, many other molecular and cellular responses did not. Phosphoproteomics uncovered a novel mode of phospho-signaling via S12-PPP1R7, and large-scale dephosphorylation events that regulate mitotic exit control in undamaged cells and the G2/M checkpoint upon IR in a dose-dependent manner. The phosphoproteomics of irradiated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair-deficient cells unveiled extended phospho-signaling duration in either a dose-dependent (DDR signaling) or independent (mTOR-ERK-MAPK signaling) manner without affecting signal magnitude. Nascent transcriptomics revealed the transcriptional activation of genes involved in NRF2-regulated antioxidant defense, redox-sensitive ERK-MAPK signaling, glycolysis and mitochondrial function after LD, suggesting a prominent role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in molecular and cellular responses to LD exposure, whereas DDR genes were prominently activated after HD. However, how and to what extent the observed dose-dependent differences in molecular and cellular responses may impact cancer development remain unclear, as the induction of chromosomal damage was found to be dose-proportional (10-200 mGy).
