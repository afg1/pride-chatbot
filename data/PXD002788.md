### Title
Bacillus cereus proteomics -  Deciphering the interactions between the Bacillus cereus linear plasmid, pBClin15, and its host by high-throughput comparative proteomics

### Description
This project contributes to the proteomic comparison of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 wild-type strain and the derivative strain cured of the linear plasmid, B. cereus ATCC 14579 -pBClin15, grown in aerobiosis condition and harvested at three growth stages.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE, sliced into polyacrylamide bands, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LTQ-Orbitrap XL tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab
