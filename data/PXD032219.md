### Title
Glycoproteomics Landscape of Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Human Alzheimer's Disease Brain

### Description
Alterations of protein abundance and post-translational modifications in patients with AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease (AD), such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, and their roles in disease progression and treatment outcome are areas of intense study. Little is known, however, about the overall N-glycosylation of proteins in human brains, and those from AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patients, particularly in regard to large-scale intact N-linked glycoproteomics analysis. To elucidate the glycoproteome landscape, we developed an approach based on multi-lectin affinity enrichment, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), and LC-MS-based glycoproteomics analysis. We analyzed 10 normal, 10 asymptomatic, and 10 symptomatic AD brains, in which we detected >300 glycoproteins and >1,900 glycoforms across the samples. The majority of glycoproteins have N-glycans that are high-mannosidic and complex chains that are fucosylated and bisected. The Man5 N-glycan was found to occur most frequently at >20% of the total glycoforms. Unlike the glycoproteomes of other tissues, sialylation is a minor feature of the brain glycoproteome, occurring at <9% of N-glycans . We observed changes in the number of antennae, frequency of fucosylation, bisection, and other monosaccharides at individual glycosylation sites among normal, asymptomatic, and symptomatic AD samples. Further analysis revealed glycosylation differences in subcellular compartments. We did not observe a statistical difference between male and female patients. These results represent the first glycoproteomics landscape of brains from multiple AD individuals, which will facilitate a deeper understanding of AD and possible disease treatment options.

### Sample Protocol
The brain tissues were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and cOmplete, mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) using a Brinkmann homogenizer twice at level 5 on ice, 20 seconds each. The samples were then sonicated three times with a Qsonica sonicator for 10 seconds each at 30 Amps with 30 seconds break between rounds. The lysates were centrifuged at 2000g for 20 minutes at 4oC. The supernatants were collected. BCA assay was performed to determine the protein concentration. The lysates were used immediately or stored at -80oC until use. A combination of six lectins was used to enrich glycoproteins from the brain lysates by mixing agarose-bound derivatives of specific lectins. These included 250 Ã‚ÂµL concanavalin A, 80 Ã‚ÂµL Ricinus communis agglutinin I, 80 Ã‚ÂµL Sambucus nigra agglutinin, 90 Ã‚ÂµL Aleuria aurantia lectin, 120 Ã‚ÂµL wheat germ agglutinin, and 80 Ã‚ÂµL Vicia villosa agglutinin (Vector Laboratories). The beads were washed four times with a washing buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor in TBS, and centrifuged at 500g for 30 seconds to remove the liquid. One milligram of brain proteins from each lysate according to the BCA assay was added to the lectin beads and incubated on a rotator at 4oC overnight. After the enrichment, the beads were washed four times with the washing buffer. The enriched glycoproteins were eluted with 1) TBS containing 200 mM methyl ÃŽÂ±-D-mannopyranoside, 200 mM methyl ÃŽÂ±-D-glucopyranoside, 200 mM D-(+)-galactose, 100 mM L-(-)-fucose, 500 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, 200 mM N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Carbosynth), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor, 2) TBS containing 500 mM D-lactose (Fisher), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor, and 3) TBS containing 500 mM D-lactose and 200 mM acetic acid (Chem-Impex). Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was performed to remove the detergent and digest the proteins as reported previously. After protein digestion, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) solid-phase extraction (SPE) was employed to enrich for glycopeptides before LC-MS/MS analysis. Cellulose microcrystalline slurry in 50% ACN was packed into an empty TT1 TopTip (Glygen) until the bed volume is approximately 1.5 centimeter high. The dried peptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA and analyzed with LC-MS/MS as described elsewhere with slight adjustments. The peptides were loaded onto a C18 PepMap 100 (300 Ã‚Âµm Ãƒâ€” 5 mm, 5 Ã‚Âµm, 100 Ãƒâ€¦ precolumn, Thermo) using 15 Ã‚ÂµL/min 0.1% FA for 3 minutes and separated with a PicoFrit analytical column (75 Ã‚Âµm ID Ãƒâ€” 150 mm, 3 Ã‚Âµm, New Objective) using a gradient of 2% to 37.2% of 80% ACN with 0.1% FA over 92 minutes and 37.2% to 90% over 3 minutes at 400 nL/min on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo). The peptides were analyzed with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a positive mode. The spray voltage was set to 2,100 V and the transfer tube temperature was 200oC. For each cycle, a full MS spectrum was recorded at the resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap with the scan range of m/z 400-1,600, RF lens of 30%, AGC target of 1e5, and a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms. Data-dependent acquisition was performed with the top 15 most intense ions selected for MS2 analysis. For proteomics experiments, HCD was used to fragment the peptides with 28% normalized collision energy (NCE). The isolation window was set to 1.2 m/z. For glycoproteomics experiments, the peptides were fragmented with stepped HCD with 30Ã‚Â±5% NCE. The isolation window was set to 1.5 m/z. The fragments were recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000.

### Data Protocol
For the proteomics experiment, the raw files were searched against the Swiss-Prot human proteome database downloaded from UniProt, which contains both canonical and non-canonical protein sequences. Byonic was used to search for the proteins present in each sample after multi-lectin enrichment and tryptic digestion. Trypsin was set as an enzyme with fully tryptic peptides and two maximum missed cleavages required. The precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.025 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0215 Da) was set as a fixed modification while oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 Da) was set as a common variable modification (common2). Results were filtered at a 1% protein false discovery rate (FDR). The proteins were combined from all runs, reverse hits and contaminants were removed, and the final protein list was used to generate a focused FASTA database for the glycoproteomics experiments. In the glycoproteomics experiment, similar parameters were employed for the search of intact glycopeptides after HILIC enrichment. However, the focused FASTA database from the proteomics experiments was employed for the search. N-linked glycosylation was searched using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“N-glycan 309 mammalian no sodiumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ database from Byonic. Results were filtered at a 1% FDR. Due to the FDR control of Byonic for intact glycopeptide identification, the glycopeptides were further filtered and manually inspected so that they have a 1D PEP score <= 0.001, |log prob|>4, score >300, and ppm<10.

### Publication Abstract
Molecular changes in the brain of individuals afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are an intense area of study. Little is known about the role of protein abundance and posttranslational modifications in AD progression and treatment, in particular large-scale intact N-linked glycoproteomics analysis. To elucidate the N-glycoproteome landscape, we developed an approach based on multi-lectin affinity enrichment, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and LC-MS-based glycoproteomics. We analyzed brain tissue from 10 persons with no cognitive impairment or AD, 10 with asymptomatic AD, and 10 with symptomatic AD, detecting over 300 glycoproteins and 1900 glycoforms across the samples. The majority of glycoproteins have N-glycans that are high-mannosidic or complex chains that are fucosylated and bisected. The Man5 N-glycan was found to occur most frequently at &gt;20% of the total glycoforms. Unlike the glycoproteomes of other tissues, sialylation is a minor feature of the brain N-glycoproteome, occurring at &lt;9% among the glycoforms. We observed AD-associated differences in the number of antennae, frequency of fucosylation, bisection, and other monosaccharides at individual glycosylation sites among samples from our three groups. Further analysis revealed glycosylation differences in subcellular compartments across disease stage, including glycoproteins in the lysosome frequently modified with paucimannosidic glycans. These results illustrate the N-glycoproteomics landscape across the spectrum of AD clinical and pathologic severity and will facilitate a deeper understanding of progression and treatment development.
