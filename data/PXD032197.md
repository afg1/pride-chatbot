### Title
Verification of utORFs in Drosophila melanogaster

### Description
To verify unannotated translated open reading frames (utORFs) identified from Drosophila melanogaster, we collected data to target them.

### Sample Protocol
We collected protein samples from D. melanogaster 0-24 hour embryos (R517 strain). In brief, we homogenized dechorionated embryos with a mortar and pestle in ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris HCl, pH7.5; 137 mM NaCl; 0.25% NP-40; Roche cOmplete protease inhibitors before centrifugation at 18k rpm at 4Â°C and filtration through a 0.45 micron PVDF membrane. Purified protein was acetone-precipitated, reduced, and alkylated before digestion with LysC and trypsin, acidified, and solid-phase extraction. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (120min gradient, 25cm EasySprayer column in high res./high mass accuracy mode) on a ThermoFisher Lumos instrument.

### Data Protocol
We analyzed the shotgun data using ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 and searched via Mascot against the Uniprot D. melanogaster database concatenated with common contaminants and our set of utORFs with a 1% peptide FDR.
