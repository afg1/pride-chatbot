### Title
General anaesthesia leads to phosphoproteome changes in proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and synaptic processes in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus

### Description
Despite the widespread use of general anaesthetics, the mechanisms mediating their effects are still not understood. Although suppressed in most parts of the brain, neuronal activity, as measured by FOS activation, is increased in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) by numerous general anaesthetics, and evidence points to this brain region being involved in the induction of general anaesthesia and natural sleep. Posttranslational modifications of proteins, including changes in phosphorylation, enable fast modulation of protein function which could be underlying the rapid effects of general anaesthesia. In order to identify potential phosphorylation events in the brain mediating general anaesthesia effects, we have explored the phosphoproteome responses in the rat SON, and compared these to cingulate cortex (CC) which displays no FOS activation is response to general anaesthetics.   We found many changes in the phosphoproteomes of both the CC and SON in response to 15 minutes of isoflurane exposure. Pathway analysis indicated that proteins undergoing phosphorylation adaptations are involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and synaptic signalling events. Importantly, changes in protein phosphorylation appeared to be brain region-specific suggesting that differential phosphorylation adaptations might underlie the different neuronal activity responses to general anaesthesia between the CC and SON. In summary, these data suggest that rapid posttranslational modifications in proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and synaptic signalling events might mediate the central mechanisms mediating general anaesthesia.

### Sample Protocol
5 CC, 6 SON and 6 neurointermediate lobe (NIL, which contains the PP) control samples and 6 CC, SON and NIL isoflurane-treated samples were processed for proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses. CC and SON samples were collected bilaterally using a 1-mm micropunch (Fine Scientific Tools) from 100 μm brain coronal sections in a cryostat. Proteins from CC, SON and NIL samples were extracted in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 150 mM NaCl; 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate; 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate; 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 1 mM EDTA) containing the protease inhibitors 1mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck, P7626), Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32963) and Pierce Phosphatase Inhibitor Mini Tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32957) in three probe sonication cycles of 12 seconds (MSE Soniprep 150). Samples were then incubated in ice for 30 minutes, vortexing every 5 minutes, and then centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and protein concentrations were determined in triplicate by Bradford assay. Total proteome and phospho proteome analysis were performed at the Bristol Proteomics Facility, University of Bristol. Aliquots of 100 µg of each sample were digested with trypsin (2.5µg trypsin per 100µg protein; 37°C, overnight), labelled with Tandem Mass Tag (TMTpro) sixteen plex reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, LE11 5RG, UK) and the labelled samples pooled. For the Phospho proteome analysis, the remainder of the TMT-labelled pooled sample was desalted using a SepPak cartridge (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA). The eluate from the SepPak cartridge was evaporated to dryness and subjected to TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). The flow-through and washes from the TiO2-based enrichment were then subjected to FeNTA-based phosphopeptide enrichment according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). The phospho-enriched samples were again evaporated to dryness and then resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by nano-LC MSMS using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Phospho-enriched fractions were further fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, peptides in 1% (v/v) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with 0.5% (v/v) acetonitrile 0.1% (v/v) formic acid peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-6% solvent B over 1min., 6-15% B over 58min., 15-32%B over 58min., 32-40%B over 5min., 40-90%B over 1min., held at 90%B for 6min and then reduced to 1%B over 1min.) with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Peptides were ionized by nano-electrospray ionization at 2.0kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 μm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 300°C. All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode using an SPS-MS3 workflow. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 000, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 200 000 and a max injection time of 50ms. Precursors were filtered with an intensity threshold of 5000, according to charge state (to include charge states 2-7) and with monoisotopic peak determination set to Peptide. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (60s +/-10ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 0.7m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 10 000, max injection time of 70ms and CID collision energy of 35%. For FTMS3 analysis, the Orbitrap was operated at 50 000 resolution with an AGC target of 50 000 and a max injection time of 105ms. Precursors were fragmented by high energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a normalised collision energy of 60% to ensure maximal TMT reporter ion yield. Synchronous Precursor Selection (SPS) was enabled to include up to 10 MS2 fragment ions in the FTMS3 scan.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the UniProt Rat database (downloaded July 2021: 35859 entries) using the SEQUEST HT algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995Da), acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011Da) and Methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus (−89.03Da) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) and the addition of the TMTpro mass tag (+304.207) to peptide N-termini and lysine as fixed modifications. For the Phospho-proteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (+79.966) was also included as a variable modification. Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed.  Protein groupings were determined by PD2.2, however, the master protein selection was improved with an in-house script. This enables us to infer biological trends more effectively in the dataset without any loss in the quality of identification or quantification. The MS data were searched against the human Uniprot database retrieved on 2022-01-05 and updated with additional annotation information on 2022-01-20.  The protein abundances were normalised within each sample to total peptide amount, and then scaled to the abundance of the common pool sample (a single representative sample run in each separate TMT experiment) to allow comparisons between experiments. The scaled abundances were then Log2 transformed to bring them closer to a normal distribution.  The phosphorylation status of identified peptide spectral matches (PSMs) was determined by PD2.2 and the site of phosphorylation predicted by PD2.2 using the PhosphoRS module. Phosphorylation sites predicted by PhosphoRS with greater than 70% confidence were taken as the likely phosphorylation site, and phosphopeptides identified with identical sequences and predicted phosphorylation sites, were combined to provide improved quantitation and confidence. The number of PSMs used to calculate the phosphosite abundance is shown in the “Contributing PSMs” column in the excel output.  Where a peptide is predicted to be phosphorylated (based on its mass), but the software is unable to assign the site, the site is listed as “Ambiguous”. Where multiple phosphorylation events are unable to be located to specific sites within a peptide, the word “Ambiguous” is repeated the corresponding number of times.  As peptides can often be matched to multiple proteins, the list of proteins to which each peptide matched was searched against the list of master proteins in the Total Protein analysis, and if a matching protein was identified, this protein was used as the master protein for that peptide.  The experiment was performed by combining an equal amount of each sample, following TMT labelling. 5% of this combined sample was used for the total proteome analysis, and 95% was taken for phosphopeptide enrichment and subsequent analysis of the phosphoproteome. After phospho enrichment we would not necessarily expect the samples to contain the same amount of phosphopeptides, due to biological differences in the levels of phosphorylation between the conditions. As such, normalisation of phosphopeptide abundance was performed using the normalisation factor generated from analysis of the corresponding samples in the total protein dataset. The samples were then scaled to the corresponding pool in the same manner as occurred with the total proteome.  When total protein data is available for the phosphopeptide, the Log2 Scaled Protein abundance was subtracted from the Log2 Scaled Phosphopeptide abundance to adjust the phosphopeptide abundance for any changes in the total protein. As such, if a constitutively phosphorylated protein doubles in its protein abundance as a result of a condition of interest, the Log2 Scaled Phosphopeptide Abundance will show a doubling in the abundance of the phosphopeptide, however the Adjusted Log2 Phosphopeptide Abundance will not show any significant change, as the same proportion of the protein is phosphorylated.  Statistical significance was determined using Welch’s T-Tests between the conditions of interest. The p-values were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
