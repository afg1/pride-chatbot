### Title
Proximal Phosphoproteomics Approaches revealed a FGFR-EGFR functional cross-talk

### Description
We developed Proximal Phosphoproteomics Approaches (PPAs)to study RTK endocytosis-dependent proximal signaling in breast cancer cells.

### Sample Protocol
We uesed in-solution difestion, pY antibody enrichment, TiO2 chromatography stageTIP Ultimate 3000 LC and Q-Exactive HF

### Data Protocol
We used MaxQuant and Perseus to analyze the data. We used STRING and Cytoscape to visulize the data. We used SILAC and LF quantification methods and biological replicates.
