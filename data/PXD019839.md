### Title
Intracellular pathways for lignin catabolism in white-rot fungi

### Description
White-rot fungi (WRF), considered the most efficient organisms at degrading organic carbon in the biosphere, are found in plant cell wall lignin biopolymer. We employ multi-omics to demonstrate that Trametes versicolor and Gelatoporia subvermispora funnel lignin-derived aromatic compounds into central carbon metabolism via intracellular catabolic pathways. These results provide insights into global carbon cycling in soil ecosystems.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MS-GF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline.
