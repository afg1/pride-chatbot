### Title
biotin RNA pulldown assay of lnc-GD2H and mass spectrometry

### Description
Vectors carrying lnc-GD2H and antisense lnc-GD2H were linearized with the corresponding restriction enzymes to prepare template DNAs for in vitro transcription. Biotinylated RNAs were mixed with proteins extracted from C2C12 cells, followed by targeting of the RNAs with streptavidin beads. After SDS-PAGE following RNA pulldown, the differentially expressed proteins were enzymolyzed and used for MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Biotinylated probe was acquired by in vitro transcription of the target RNA. The biotinylated lnc-GD2H-RNA probe was added into streptavidin magnetic beads; then proteins extracted from C2C12 cells were prepared and incubated with probe to obtain the complex of magnetic beads-RNA-protein; and the hybrid protein was eluted to remove impure protein to getthe complex of RNA-protein.The obtained products were identified by mass spectrometry; then GO, KEGG and String analysis were implemented further.

### Data Protocol
Original data file of RAW format obtained from mass spectrometer was converted into MGF format using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fisher). The MGF file was input into protein library ProteinPilot™ Software 4.5 (Version 1656, AB Sciex) for mass spectrometry retrieval.After the retrieval, the original results were screened with Unused value≥1.3 and Protein confidence ＞95%. Remove the decoy database and the records beginning with "RRRRR" in the retrieval results.FDR analysis was performed in ProteinPilot™ by decoy database retrieval as a way to determine the accuracy of retrieval results; so as toacquire reliable analysis results.
