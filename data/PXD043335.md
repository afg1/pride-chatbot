### Title
Osteogenic human MSC-derived extracellular vesicles regulate MSC activity and osteogenic differentiation and promote bone regeneration in a rat calvarial defect model

### Description
The objective of this study was to explore the characteristics and roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) obtained from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under two culture conditions: undifferentiated MSCs (Naïve-EVs) and MSCs undergoing early-stage osteogenesis (Osteo-EVs). Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the potential of Osteo-EVs to induce bone formation for the purpose of regenerating bone defects in rat calvaria. To accomplish these goals, EVs from both groups were isolated using a technique called size-exclusion chromatography. The isolated EVs were then subjected to various analyses to gain insights into their properties. This included examining their size distribution, morphology, flow cytometry analysis, and proteome profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with Label Free Quantification.

### Sample Protocol
1- Collection of Conditioned Medium (CM): • Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) at passage 3-5 were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 4000 cells/cm2 in growth medium (GM). • To generate CM from hMSC undergoing osteogenic differentiation, the cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OM) containing specific components. • The cells were maintained in OM for 7 days. • After 7 days, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) for an additional 3 days. • The CM collected from the first 2 days and the third day was pooled separately to create osteogenic-conditioned medium (Osteo-CM) and naïve-conditioned medium (Naïve-CM). • The CM samples were then centrifuged at 4°C to remove cell debris and apoptotic bodies, followed by filtration through a 0.2 µm filter to remove larger particles. • The prepared CM samples were stored at -80°C for further use. 2- Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs): • Osteo-CM and Naïve-CM were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with Ultracel-100 membrane. • The concentrated CM was adjusted to 500 µl using filtered and degassed PBS and stored as concentrated CM (CCM) at -80°C. • Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed using a 10 ml qEV column. • The CCM (500 µl) from each group was applied to the qEV column. • The first 3 ml of flowthrough fractions were discarded, while the following 2.5 ml fractions were collected as EV fractions and stored at -80°C. • Protein lysates from the isolated Osteo-EVs and Naïve-EVs were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with Label Free Quantification. 3- Sample Preparation for LC-MS/MS Analysis: Approximately 0.5ug of protein in the form of tryptic peptides, dissolved in 2% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.5% formic acid (FA), were injected into an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, California, USA). The system was connected online to an Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), equipped with an EASY-spray nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The sample was loaded and desalted on a pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 2cm x 75µm ID nanoViper column) with 3µm C18 beads. The process involved a flow rate of 5µl/min for 5 minutes using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were then separated using a biphasic ACN gradient on a 50 cm analytical column (PepMap RSLC, 50cm x 75 µm ID EASY-spray column) packed with 2µm C18 beads. The separation was achieved by two nanoflow UPLC pumps with a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Solvent A and B consisted of 0.1% TFA (vol/vol) in water and 100% ACN, respectively. The gradient composition involved a series of steps: 5%B during trapping for 5 minutes, followed by 5-8%B over 1 minute, 8–25%B for 124 minutes, 25-35%B for 30 minutes, and 35–85%B for 5 minutes. Elution of hydrophobic peptides and column conditioning were accomplished through 10 minutes of isocratic elution with 85%B and 15 minutes of isocratic conditioning with 5%B. Instrument control was conducted using Thermo Scientific SII for Xcalibur 1.6. Peptides were detected using the Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer with FAIMS, employing three compensation voltages and the "Advanced Peak Determination" feature. The mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, alternating between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition. Instrument control was achieved through Orbitrap Exploris 480 Tune 3.1 and Xcalibur 4.4. MS spectra were acquired in the 375-1500 m/z range with a resolution of R = 120,000 at m/z 200. The most intense peptides (charge states 2 to 6) were sequentially isolated with a standard target value or maximum injection time. Fragmentation was performed using Higher-Energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 30%. Fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200, with specific settings for the first mass. One MS/MS spectrum of a precursor mass was allowed before dynamic exclusion, and lock-mass internal calibration was not utilized. The spray and ion-source parameters were as follows. Ion spray voltage = 2000V, no sheath and auxiliary gas flow, and capillary temperature = 275 °C.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS raw data were processed using MaxQuant software and searched against a concatenated forward and reverse-decoy Swiss-Prot Homo Sapiens database. The Osteo- and Naïve-EVs protein datasets were filtered and analyzed for relative protein quantification using Perseus software. Proteins that were not present in all three donors of each EV group were filtered out to ensure accurate quantification. The presence of common EV proteins in each EV group was compared using a Venn diagram and compared with the Extracellular Vesicles database. FunRich analysis tool was used to identify the Gene Ontology Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Components associated with the common EV proteins. Statistical analysis was performed using LIMMA and DEqMS packages in R to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between Osteo- and Naïve-EVs. The Gene Ontology Resource and Fisher's Exact Test were used to predict GO BP, GO MF, and Reactome pathways of the DEPs. To assess the potential participation of EV proteins in bone-related processes, relevant bone biological process terms were compared with the names of DEPs and unique EV proteins using QuickGO.
