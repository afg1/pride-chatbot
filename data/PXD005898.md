### Title
Quantitative proteomics analysis of medullary thyroid carcinoma

### Description
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for less than 5% of all thyroid cancers, and it is a rare neuroendocrine tumor which derives from calcitonin-secreting thyroid C cells.Given the underlying mechanism involved in MTC remain unclear, the development and the specific pathways of MTC require further investigation.here we employed the application of TMT6plex-based LC-MS/MS to identify and analyze the novel differentially-expressed proteins(DEPs) from MTC patients, To our best knowledge, it is the first study to comprehensively investigate the molecular mechanisms of MTC by proteomics technology from Chinese MTC patientsâ€™ tissues, and these DEPs identified in our study will provide a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of MTC, as well as may provide potential therapeutic targets for patients with MTC.

### Sample Protocol
Due to MTC is a rare disease, only three fresh medullary thyroid tumorous tissues and their contralateral non-tumorous tissues were collected from the Department of head and neck Surgery, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute from January 2016 to December 2016. These tissues from each patient were obtained immediately by a single surgeon during thyroidectomy procedure, and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 oC until use. All tissues were evaluated by clinical pathologists using H&E and IHC staining (including TTF-1, Calcitonin, CgA, and CEA) to confirm the diagnosis of MTC. The clinical and histological features of these patients are shown in Table 1. Tissues used in this study were obtained with informed consent of the patients and this study was approved by Ethical committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS raw data were analyzed against the reviewed Swiss-prot human FASTA database from UniProt (released on 2015.09.07) using the Proteome Discoverer software (Version 1.4, Thermo Scientific). The search criteria were set as follows: Carbamidomethylation (C, +57.021 Da) and TMT-sixplex(K and peptide N terminals) as the static modifications and oxidation(methionine, M) as the dynamic modification.  A maximum number of allowed missed cleavages by trypsin/Lys-C cleavage were set as two. Mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 10 ppm (all MS in an Orbitrap mass analyzer) and 20 mmu (all MS2 spectra), respectively. False discovery was determined based on peptide spectrum match when searched against the reversed decoy database, and protein identification lying within a 1% global false discovery rate were taken forward for analysis. The experiment bias was normalized on protein median, and the minimum protein count was set as 20
