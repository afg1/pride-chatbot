### Title
Proteomic analysis of endometrioid and high-grade serous ovarian tumour samples

### Description
Precision medicine approaches in ovarian cancer require the accurate diagnosis of histotypes. In particular, there is a critical need to distinguish endometroid (EC) from high grade serous (HGSC) carcinomas, which differ greatly in outcomes, genetic predisposition and optimal treatment approaches. Herein, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on freshly frozen tumour tissues to discover biomarkers that may distinguish EC from HGSC, and then used IHC to validate these using a contemporarily classified cohort of EC and HGSC samples.

### Sample Protocol
Cryopreserved tumour pieces were briefly pulverized into a fine powder, solubilized in lysis buffer and sonicated. Following alkylation, proteins were precipitated with chloroform/methanol then digested in-solution overnight. Unfractionated digests were analyzed on an Orbitrap Elite and Q Exactive Plus.

### Data Protocol
Database searching and label-free quantification were performed in MaxQuant (1.5.8.3), and results were analyzed in Perseus (version 1.5.5.3 and 1.6.2.1).
