### Title
The interacted proteins of ALKBH5 and FTO identified by IP-mass

### Description
Since m6A demethylases (FTO and ALKBH5) have been reported to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing regulation, we hypothesized that dynamic m6A distribution during mRNA maturation might involve removal of m6A in internal exons by FTO or ALKBH5 accompanied by splicing factors. To explore this we performed pull-down assays coupled with protein mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
whole cell extracts were prepared by adding lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail) directly to the cells, incubating on ice for 15 min and centrifuging lysates at 20,000g for 15 minutes in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Protein complexes were isolated as described before (1), with a few exceptions: BC100 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.8), 0.2% NP40), was used for all the washing steps instead of BC500 buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained gel was submitted to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School for protein identification in gel sections.

### Data Protocol
Mass Spectrometry analysis was conducted at Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility
