### Title
Analysis of NF186 proximity proteomes across neuronal development using Nfasc antibodies in an antibody-directed proximity biotinylation strategy combined with mass spectrometry

### Description
Axon initial segment (AIS) cell surface proteins mediate key biological processes in neurons including action potential initiation and axo-axonic synapse formation. However, few AIS cell surface proteins have been identified. Here, we used antibody-directed proximity biotinylation to define the cell surface proteins in close proximity to the AIS cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin.

### Sample Protocol
Protein digestion was performed on-beads. Sample Sample-incubated streptavidin sepharose beads were resuspended in 5 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for 30 min at 37C. After this, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 7.5 mM and samples incubated for 30 additional minutes at room temperature, followed by overnight treatment with trypsin, peptide recovery and desalting using a C18 Zip tip for mass spectrometry analysis

### Data Protocol
Data were searched against the mouse subsets of the SwissProt database (SwissProt.2017.11.01) (plus the corresponding randomized sequences to calculate FRD on the searches), using Protein Prospector. 1% FDR was allowed on searches for each individual sample, then results were merged
