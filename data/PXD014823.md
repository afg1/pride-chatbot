### Title
Global proteomic profiling of meningioma cohort

### Description
Global proteomic profiling of meningiomas using LFQ approach to identify biomarkers in meningioma patients

### Sample Protocol
Urea lysis of surgically resected brain tissue samples with trypsinization using Trypsin followed by clean up using C18 catridges. Drying of peptides followed by reconstitution in 0.1% FA. Sample run in Q-EXactive Mass Spectrometry

### Data Protocol
.raw files were analysed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2, Data normalized against total peptide intensity and Log2 conversion of normalized abundances

### Publication Abstract
None
