### Title
Tobacco pollen tube-secretome following penetration through the pistil

### Description
As in animals, cell-cell communication plays pivotal role in male-female recognition during plant sexual reproduction. Prelaid peptides secreted from the female reproductive tissues guide pollen tubes towards ovules for fertilization. However, the elaborate mechanisms for this dialogue have remained elusive, particularly from the male perspective.  We perform genome-wide quantitative liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry of a pistil-stimulated pollen tube secretome and identify 801 pollen tube-secreted proteins. Interestingly, in silico analysis reveals that the pollen tube-secretome is dominated by unconventional-type secreted proteins representing 57% of the total secretome. In support, we show that unconventional-type protein, translationally controlled tumor protein, is secreted to the apoplast. Remarkably, we discover that this protein could be secreted by infiltrating through the initial phases of the conventional secretory pathway and could reach the apoplast via exosomes as demonstrated by co-localization with Oleisin1 exosome marker. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana translationally controlled tumor protein-knockdown plants have pollen tubes that poorly navigate to the target ovule, and theÂ  knocked down allele is poorly transmitted through the male. We show that regulators of the endoplasmic reticulum-trans-golgi network protein secretory pathway control secretion of pollen tube-secreted cysteine-rich proteins, including pollen tube attractants, and are essential for pollen tube growth and guidance, as well as ovule-targeting competence.  This work, the first pollen tube secretome study, identifies novel genome-wide pollen tube-secreted proteins with potential function in pollen tube-ovule guidance for sexual reproduction. Functional analysis highlights a potential mechanism for pollen tube unconventional protein secretion and reveals likely regulators of pollen tube protein secretion. The association of pollen tube-secreted proteins with marker proteins shown to be secreted via exosomes in other species suggest secretion via exosomes as a possible mechanism for cell-cell communication between the pollen tube and female reproductive cells.

### Sample Protocol
Preparation of tobacco pollen tube-secretome using SIV-PS approach To capture pollen tube-secreted proteins following penetration through pistil, we developed the following procedure: Day 1, flowers were emasculated one day before anthesis and netted for 24 h. Day 2, stored pollen grains from -200C were acclimatized to room temperature for five minutes and used for limited pollination of half of the emasculated flowers. Day 3, both pollinated and un-pollinated (control) pistils were collected and excised at approximately 22mm from the stigma shoulders Pistils were arranged in a â€œgermination cupâ€� (5 x 4 cm radius x height) filled with SMM-MES pollen germination media (0.175M sucrose, 1.6mM H3BO3, 3M Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, 0.8mM MgSO4.7H2O, 1M KNO3, 23mM MES, pH 5.9). Pollen tube germination was performed at 28oC in a 70% humid chamber for 24 h. Proteins secreted into the media were concentrated using Millipore filter (Amicon Ultra-2 Pre-Launch 10K and 3K), and final samples were stored at -80oC. Final protein concentrations were measured by 2D-Quanti kit (GE Healthcare).   FASP processing Biological replicates of all samples (including negative controls from un-pollinated pistils)  were subjected to filter aided sample preparation (FASP). Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) was added onto the filter during protein digestion step (14 h at 37Â°C). The tryptic peptides were finally eluted by centrifugation followed by two additional elutions with 50 Î¼l of 50mM NaHCO3. Final eluate was concentrated using SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) down to about 20 Î¼l and transferred into LC-MS vial containing 2.5 Î¼l of 0.01% PEG, with additional utilization of acidic â€œextractionâ€� of peptides from FASP eluate test tube walls by 50% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 2.5% formic acid (v/v) and by 100 Î¼l of 100% ACN (each extraction step was done twice with 50 and 100 Î¼l of the solution, respectively). Final solution was concentrated by SpeedVac concentrator to <25 Î¼l and refilled to 25 Î¼l by water.  LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides from FASP LC-MS/MS analyses of peptide mixture were done using RSLCnano system connected to Orbitrap Elite hybrid spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Prior to LC separation, tryptic digests were online concentrated and desalted using trapping column and after washing eluted from the trapping column onto a Acclaim Pepmap100 C18 column (2 Âµm particles, 75 Î¼m Ã— 250 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) by the gradient program (mobile phase A: 0.1% FA in water; mobile phase B: ACN:methanol:2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (6:3:1; v/v/v) containing 0.1% FA). The analytical column outlet was directly connected to the Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). MS data were acquired in a data-dependent strategy selecting up to top 20 precursors based on precursor abundance in the survey scan (350-1700 m/z). The resolution of the survey scan was 120 000 (400 m/z) with a target value of 1Ã—106 ions, one microscan and maximum injection time of 200 ms. Low resolution CID MS/MS spectra were acquired with a target value of 10 000 in rapid CID scan mode with m/z range adjusted according to actual precursor mass and charge. MS/MS acquisition in the linear ion trap was carried out in parallel to the survey scan in the Orbitrap analyser by using the preview mode. The maximum injection time for MS/MS was 150 ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 45 s after one MS/MS spectra acquisition and early expiration was disabled. The isolation window for MS/MS fragmentation was set to 2 m/z. Two LC-MS/MS analyses in total were done for each sample (using 10 out of 25 Î¼l of final solution). The second LC-MS/MS analysis was done with exclusion of m/z masses already assigned to peptide from target database (FDR < 1%) based on the first LC-MS/MS analysis. Mass tolerance for m/z exclusion was set to 10 ppm and retention time window to 2 min. The two resulting raw files for each sample were searched as single data set to obtain complete identification results for each sample.

### Data Protocol
The analysis of the mass spectrometric RAW data files was carried out using the Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; version 1.4) with in-house Mascot (Matrixscience, London, UK; version 2.4.1) and Sequest search engines utilisation. Mascot MS/MS ion searches were done against concatenated UniRef100 protein database for Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae taxonomies (downloaded at 2014-02-26 from http://www.uniprot.org/) and in house tobacco protein database based on sequencing data (total number of protein sequences 624,436). Modified cRAP database (downloaded from http://www.thegpm.org/crap/) was searched in parallel for detection of contaminants. Mass tolerance for peptides and MS/MS fragments were 5 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Oxidation of methionine and deamidation (N, Q) as optional modification, carbamidomethylation of C as fixed modification and two enzyme miss cleavages were set for all searches. Percolator was used for post-processing of database search results. Peptides with false discovery rate (FDR; q-value) < 1%, rank 1 and with at least 6 amino acids were considered. Label-free quantification using protein group area calculation in Proteome Discoverer was used (Top3 protein quantification). Two LC-MS/MS analyses in total were done for each sample (using 10 out of 25 Î¼l of final solution). The second LC-MS/MS analysis was done with exclusion of m/z masses already assigned to peptide from target database (FDR < 1%) based on the first LC-MS/MS analysis. Mass tolerance for m/z exclusion was set to 10 ppm and retention time window to 2 min. The two resulting raw files for each sample were searched as single data set to obtain complete identification results for each sample.
