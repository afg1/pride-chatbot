### Title
SPPL3 cleavage of glycosyltransferases regulates their activity

### Description
The GxGD intramembrane-cleaving aspartylprotease signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) is a Golgi-resident, multi-pass membrane protein that is highly conserved among multicellular eukaryotes pointing to a pivotal physiological function in the Golgi network. Recently, the key branching enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) and other medial/trans Golgi glycosyltransferases were identified as first physiological SPPL3 substrates. SPPL3-mediated endoproteolysis releases these enzymes from their type II membrane anchors resulting in a subsequent secretion of the respective enzymesâ€™ ectodomain. To systematically identify further SPPL3 substrates we used the secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS) method that makes secretomes of cultured cells accessible to mass spectrometric analyses. SPECS analyses of SPPL3-deficient and SPPL3-overexpression cell culture models revealed numerous  additional SPPL3 candidate substrates and their subsequent biochemical validation underscores the role of SPPL3 in secretion of these proteins. In line with our previous observations, all novel SPPL3 substrates adopt a type II topology and the majority localizes to the Golgi network and is implicated in Golgi function. Importantly, most of the novel SPPL3 substrates catalyze the modification of N-linked glycans but also of O-glycans and glycosaminoglycans. Hence, SPPL3 emerges as a crucial player of Golgi function and the newly identified SPPL3 substrates will be instrumental to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological function of SPPL3 in the Golgi network and in vivo.

### Sample Protocol
SPECS workflow Secretome enriched and subsequent proteomic analyses were essentially performed as detailed earlier (16). In brief, 40 million cells were plated and incubated for 48 h in 20 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 200 nM tetraacetyl-N-azidoacetyl mannosamine (ManNAZ). Cells ectopically expressing SPPL3 were pre-incubated with media supplemented with 1 Âµg/ml doxycycline and labeling was likewise performed in the presence of doxycycline. Conditioned media were collected and filtered through 0.45 mm PVDF filter (Millex) into a VivaSpin 20 centrifugal concentrator  (30 kDa) at 4Â°C. VivaSpin 20 columns were centrifuged at 4600 r.p.m. at 4Â°C to remove non-metabolized ManNAZ. The retentate was filled with 20 ml H2O. This procedure was repeated three times. In the last step, the H2O refill step was omitted. Instead, 100 nM of DBCO-PEG12-biotin (Click-chemistry tools) diluted in 1 ml ddH2O was added to biotinylate metabolically azide-labelled glycoproteins. Columns were incubated overnight at 4Â°C. For removal of non-reacted DBCO-PEG12-Biotin, VivaSpin20 columns were subject to three times of centrifugation with subsequent PBS buffer refill. After the last centrifugation step, the retentate was diluted in 5 ml PBS with 2% SDS (v/v) and 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). For purification of biotinylated proteins, the sample was loaded on a 10-ml polyprep column with a streptavidin bed of 300 Âµl streptavidin slurry. After binding of proteins, streptavidin beads were washed 3 times with 10 ml PBS supplemented with 1% SDS. To elute the biotinylated and azide-labelled glycoproteins, streptavidin beads were boiled with urea sample buffer containing 3 mM biotin to compete for the binding of biotinylated proteins.  SDSâ€“PAGE separation, trypsinization Proteins were separated on a 10% Tris/glycine SDS gel. Afterwards, qualitatively equal gel slices were cut out from the gel with the exception of the remaining albumin band at around 60 kDa. Proteins in the gel slices were subject to trypsinization according to standard protocols (18).  Mass spectrometric analysis Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on an Easy NLC 1000 nanoflow HPLC system II (Proxeon) connected to an LTQ-Velos Orbitrap Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography using in-house made 30 cm columns (New Objective, FS360-75-8-N-S-C30) packed with C18-AQ 2,4 Âµm resin (Dr Maisch GmbH, Part No. r124.aq). A 90-min gradient (5â€“40%) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min was used. The measurement method consisted of an initial FTMS scan recorded in profile mode with 30 000 m/z resolution, a mass range from 300 to 2000 m/z and a target value of 1000 000. Subsequently, collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation was performed for the 15 most intense ions with an isolation width of 2 Da in the ion trap. A target value of 10000, enabled charge state screening, a monoisotopic precursor selection, 35% normalized collision energy, an activation time of 10 ms, wide band activation and a dynamic exclusion list with 30 s exclusion time were applied.

### Data Protocol
Analysis of mass spectrometry data For data analysis five biological replicates of the HEK293T secretome and five biological replicates with 2 technical replicates of the MEF secretome were analyzed with the freely available MaxQuant suite (version 1.5.0.14) (19). Protein identification was performed using the integrated Andromeda search algorithm (20). Mass recalibration was done by a first search in a reduced murine protein database. Main search was performed using a murine Uniprot database (version 3.68) allowing for N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modifications. Two missed cleavages were allowed. Peptide as well as protein false discovery rate was set to 0. 1%. Mass accuracy was set to 20 ppm for the first search and 5 ppm for the main search. Label-free quantification was performed between the respective control and SPPL3 knockout or SPPL3 overexpression condition on the basis of unique peptides. P-values were calculated with studentâ€™s t-test for all proteins based on the absolute label free quantification (LFQ) ratios in case of the HEK293 secretome and on relative LFQ values for the MEF secretome where two technical replicates allowed calculation of the variance of the control cells between different biological replicates. Proteins with a p-value of pâ‰¤0.05 were considered as hits.

### Publication Abstract
Signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (Sppl3) is a Golgi-resident intramembrane-cleaving protease that is highly conserved among multicellular eukaryotes pointing to pivotal physiological functions in the Golgi network which are only beginning to emerge. Recently, Sppl3 was shown to control protein N-glycosylation, when the key branching enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) and other medial/trans Golgi glycosyltransferases were identified as first physiological Sppl3 substrates. Sppl3-mediated endoproteolysis releases the catalytic ectodomains of these enzymes from their type II membrane anchors. Protein glycosylation is a multistep process involving numerous type II membrane-bound enzymes, but it remains unclear whether only few of them are Sppl3 substrates or whether Sppl3 cleaves many of them and thereby controls protein glycosylation at multiple levels. Therefore, to systematically identify Sppl3 substrates we used Sppl3-deficient and Sppl3-overexpression cell culture models and analyzed them for changes in secreted membrane protein ectodomains using the proteomics "secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS)" method. SPECS analysis identified numerous additional new Sppl3 candidate glycoprotein substrates, several of which were biochemically validated as Sppl3 substrates. All novel Sppl3 substrates adopt a type II topology. The majority localizes to the Golgi network and is implicated in Golgi functions. Importantly, most of the novel Sppl3 substrates catalyze the modification of N-linked glycans. Others contribute to O-glycan and in particular glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, suggesting that Sppl3 function is not restricted to N-glycosylation, but also functions in other forms of protein glycosylation. Hence, Sppl3 emerges as a crucial player of Golgi function and the newly identified Sppl3 substrates will be instrumental to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological function of Sppl3 in the Golgi network and in vivo.
