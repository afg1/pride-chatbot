### Title
Pilot evaluation of two Fasciola hepatica biomarkers for supporting TCBZ efficacy diagnostics

### Description
Two Fasciola hepatica biomarkers, calreticulin and triose phosphate isomerase, of prospective diagnostic potential were recombinantly expressed and analysed through gel-based proteomics and liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Formal identifications through tandem mass spectrometry were ascertained as a prerequisite to immunologic evaluations.

### Sample Protocol
Genetic constructs containing the targets of interest were prepared for recombinant expression, liquid cultures were grown overnight then diluted (1:70) into fresh LB broth with appropriate antibiotic selection until A600 = 0.6–1.0. Following induction of expression with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [0.1–1 mM], cultures were incubated at 37°C and 150 RPM for five hours. Cells were lysed by pelleting at 10,000 x g at 4°C for 10 minutes, resuspended in cold lysis buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4; 0.4 M sodium chloride; 5 mM magnesium chloride) and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen followed by three cycles of sonication and resting on ice for 15 s each. Crude soluble proteins were filtered with 0.22 μm PEF (Merck Millipore, Germany) before HIS-Select Nickel or HIS-Select Cobalt (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) immobilised metal ion chromatography (IMAC) to isolate polyhisitidine-tagged proteins using 50–500 mM imidazole. Purified fractions were filtered using Amicon® Ultra 10K or 30K Centrifugal Filters (Merck, UK) as recommended by the manufacturer and resuspended in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ). Protein concentrations were calculated using the Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976: doi:10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3). Purified recombinant proteins were analysed by duplicate SDS PAGE alongside the Amersham Low Molecular Weight SDS Calibration Kit (kilodaltons, Mr) as follows. For 1-DE, 0.1–2 µg purified protein was used in 1–20 µL volume with SDS buffer (final concentration: 69.45 mM tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 11.1% (v/v) glycerol; 1% (w/v) SDS; 0.005% (w/v) bromophenol blue) including β-mercaptoethanol [1:10 dilution] or DTT [50 mM]. For 2-DE procedures, 1–5 µg purified protein in 125 µL buffer A (8 M urea; 2% w/v CHAPS; 33 mM dithiotreitol (DTT); 0.5% v/v carrier ampholytes (Biolyte 3–10, Bio-Rad, UK)) was allowed to passively rehydrate 7 cm linear pH 3–10 IPG strips (Bio-Rad, UK) at room temperature overnight. Rehydrated strips were isoelectrically focussed at 10,000–11,000 Vh using a Protean Mini IEF Cell (Bio-Rad, UK) to separate protein samples in the first dimension then equilibrated in buffer B (50 mM tris-HCl; 6 M urea; 30% (w/v) glycerol; 2% (w/v) SDS) containing DTT [10 mg/mL] for 15 minutes then buffer B containing IAA [25 mg/mL] for a further 15 minutes. Electrophoresis was conducted at ambient temperature using the Protean Mini Tetra System (Bio-Rad, UK) in [1X] TGS buffer. Samples were aliquoted into wells (1-DE) or strips were overlaid in molten agarose (0.5% (w/v) agarose; 0.125 M tris (pH 6.8); [100 mg/mL] bromophenol blue) (2-DE) prior to electrophoretic separation at 75 V through a stacking gel (4.5% acrylamide; 0.5 M tris, pH 6.8; 0.4% (w/v) SDS), followed by 150 V through the resolving gel (12.5% acrylamide; 1.5 M tris, pH 8.5; 0.4% (w/v) SDS) as required. Gels were fixed (10% (v/v) acetic acid; 40% (v/v) ethanol) and stained with Coomassie blue (PhastGel Blue R, Amersham Biosciences, UK) with 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 30% (v/v) methanol or Coomassie blue solution (QC Colloidal Coomassie, Bio-Rad) then destained in 1% (v/v) acetic acid as required. In-gel tryptic digestion was conducted prior to analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry according to the method previously described by Davis et al. (2019: doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0007191), including duplicate samples for 1-DE-separated mono-morphic rFhTPI monomer and dimer bands, and gel piece negative controls for 1-DE and 2-DE sample preparation methods.

### Data Protocol
Data files were submitted to a MASCOT MS/MS ions search (Matrix Science) against the PRJEB6687 Fasciola hepatica genome (WBPS v9, cross-referenced and matched to PRJEB25283, WBPS v14) with search parameters as previously described by Davis et al. (2019: doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0007191), except allowing for 2+, 3+ or 4+ charged peptide residues and including a decoy search with each submission.
