### Title
Hippocampus proteome Mus musculus

### Description
To describe the protein profile in hippocampus, colon and ileum tissue’ changing after the old faeces transplants, we adopted a quantitative label free proteomics approach.

### Sample Protocol
The total protein extraction from the tissue, in solution digested by trypsin and LysC enzymes were analysed by chromatographic separation coupled to online high resolution Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer

### Data Protocol
MS raw data were analysed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.3), using Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant and consulting the Homo Sapiens UniProtKB database; the tolerance on parents was 10 ppm and on fragments was 0.02 ppm. The variable modifications allowed were oxidation on methionine and acetylation on N terminus and carbamidometylation on cysteine as fixed modification.
