### Title
Collagen sequencing and ZooMS biomarkers of Mediterranean groupers (Epinephelus spp.)

### Description
Groupers (Epinephelidae) are ecologically, commercially, and culturally important predatory fishes throughout their global distribution range in tropical, subtropical and occasionally temperate regions. They are key species for modern and ancient fisheries in the Mediterranean which have been heavily overfished in the past century leading to smaller catch sizes, lower CPUE, and decreased biomass. There are four species of grouper native to the Mediterranean within the Epinephelus genus.The abundance and distribution of grouper species prior to the 20th century in the Mediterranean remains poorly known. Using peptide mass fingerprinting, also known as Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS), we investigated if ZooMS is a viable method for identifying intra-genus grouper bones to species level. Due to the lack of publicly available genomic sequences and for validation of ZooMS markers, we reconstructed collagen type I amino acid sequences using LC-MS/MS for four Epinephelus spp. Adequate variation between collagen sequences enabled the production of the best supported phylogenetic tree for Mediterranean Epinephelus spp. to date. We identified 23 previously undescribed ZooMS biomarkers capable of distinguishing groupers to the species level. Our novel biomarkers were applied to a case study of 23 grouper/comber fish bones from the Middle to Late Holocene archaeological site of Kinet Höyük, located along the coast of Iskenderun Bay, Turkey. ZooMS markers enabled species level identification of 19 bones with 18 identified as Epinephelus aeneus and 1 identified as Epinephelus marginatus. Combining ZooMS identifications with catch size reconstructions has revealed that E. aeneus is capable of growing ca. 30 cm larger than previously reported. This abundance and dominance of E. aeneus locally at Kinet Höyük is consistent with E. aeneus being the most prevalent grouper species in Iskenderun Bay today, testifying to several millennia of this species local population persistence despite fishing pressure, habitat degradation, and climatic changes.

### Sample Protocol
Collagen extraction followed the protocol detailed in (Buckley et al. 2009) with minor modification. ZooMS samples were analysed using a calibrated ultrafleXtreme (Bruker Daltonics) MALDI-TOF instrument in reflector mode. For the LC-MS/MS data, all reference samples were analysed on a 77 min gradient with an EASY-nLC 1200 (Proxeon) connected to an Exploris 480 Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS/MS data, in the form of Thermo RAW files, from our modern Mediterranean groupers was first analysed against our reference library in pFind (version 3.1.6). Our reference library used in pFind was created using available fish collagen type I sequences found on UniProt and NCBI. Mediterranean grouper LC-MS/MS data was compared with the reference library to detect possible amino acid substitutions between our samples and the reference library. Searches in pFind were run with peptide mass tolerance + / - 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance + / - 0.05 Da. Libraries containing our hypothetical COL1 sequences and unmodified fish COL1 sequences were searched against our LC-MS/MS data in MaxQuant (version 2.1.4.0).   MALDI-TOF spectra for modern and archaeological samples were visualised in mMass (version 5.50)Baseline corrections and smoothing were applied with the default settings. Peaks were picked using a signal to noise ratio of 3.0 - 5.0 and then manually inspected. Masses of distinctive peaks in mMass found in modern samples were compared to the respective LC-MS/MS data in MaxQuant to confirm the mass and coverage of species-specific peptide biomarkers.

### Publication Abstract
Marine historical ecology provides a means to establish baselines to inform current fisheries management. Groupers (Epinephelidae) are key species for fisheries in the Mediterranean, which have been heavily overfished. Species abundance and distribution prior to the 20th century in the Mediterranean remains poorly known. To reconstruct the past biogeography of Mediterranean groupers, we investigated whether Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) can be used for identifying intra-genus grouper bones to species level. We discovered 22 novel, species-specific ZooMS biomarkers for groupers. Applying these biomarkers to Kinet H&#xf6;y&#xfc;k, a Mediterranean archaeological site, demonstrated 4000&#x2009;years of regional <i>Epinephelus aeneus</i> dominance and resiliency through millennia of fishing pressures, habitat degradation and climatic changes. Combining ZooMS identifications with catch size reconstructions revealed the <i>Epinephelus aeneus</i> capacity for growing 30&#x2009;cm larger than hitherto documented, revising the maximum Total Length from 120 to 150&#x2009;cm. Our results provide ecological baselines for a key Mediterranean fishery which could be leveraged to define and assess conservation targets.
