### Title
Cortisol binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 S1 identified by limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry

### Description
We used a limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry approach to pinpoint binding sites of cortisol on SARS-CoV-2 S1. Binding target identification is based on the principle that small-ligand binding alters (increases or decreases) the protease accessibility of the target protein37,38. The binding of the ligand (cortisol) to the target protein (SARS-CoV-2 S1) induces perturbations/conformational changes at the binding sites which can lead to either facilitating or preventing proteolysis by non-specific proteases (thermolysin and trypsin)37,38. We subjected SARS-CoV-2 S1 incubated with either cortisol or vehicle to proteolysis by thermolysin followed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry-based identification of the resultant peptides. We found that cortisol either facilitated or prevented S1 proteolytic cleavage at discrete sites. Six unique peptides were identified that were only present for SARS-CoV-2 S1 incubated with either cortisol or vehicle.

### Sample Protocol
To identify cortisol binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, we applied a recently developed proteomics approach that allows identification of small ligand binding sites on a proteome-wide scale. The protein of interest is mixed with the putative ligand and any consequential perturbations/conformational changes of protein structure are revealed by double-protease digestion (first, with a nonspecific protease under native conditions and next with trypsin under denaturing conditions). We incubated 0.1 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµg/ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµL SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Catalog# RKNCOVS1H, Reprokine, USA) with 1 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµM cortisol or vehicle for 30 minutes followed by addition of 0.001 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµg/ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµL of thermolysin (a non-specific metalloproteinase, Catalog#T7902, Sigma Aldrich, USA). After 30 minutes at 37ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C, the proteolysis reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµM O-phenanthroline and freezing on dry ice.  After thawing, samples were reduced (200 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate), alkylated (200 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM bicarbonate), digested with trypsin overnight at 37ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C, and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were reconstituted in 4% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid and then zip-tipped. The tryptic peptides were resolved and ionized by using nano flow HPLC (Easy-nLC 1000, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an EASY-Spray capillary HPLC column (ES800A, 75um x 15cm, 100ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦, 3ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼m, Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode, recording high-accuracy and high-resolution survey orbitrap spectra using external mass calibration, with a resolution of 35,000 and m/z range of 300ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ1700. The twelve most intense multiply charged ions were sequentially fragmented by using higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD), and spectra of their fragments were recorded in the orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500; after fragmentation, all precursors selected for dissociation were dynamically excluded for 30s.  Data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the database was searched using SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Search parameters included a strict false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, a relaxed FDR of 0.05, a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.01 Da.  Peptides were searched with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a static modification and oxidized methionine and deamidated glutamine and asparagine as dynamic modifications.
