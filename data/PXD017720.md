### Title
High-throughput proteotyping based on microplate paramagnetic beads and phylopeptidomics

### Description
Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteotyping of a mixture of three microorganisms.

### Sample Protocol
Bacteria and yeast from the Mix3* artificial mixture were lyzed by bead beating. The resulting extracted proteins were cleanup and proteolyzed with trypsin on SP3 paramagnetic beads either in-tube or in 96-well plate.  The resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then analyzed by metaproteomics for identifying the microorganisms present in the sample and their biomass contributions were estimated by phylopeptidomics. Identified proteins and microorganism abundances obtained in SP3 in-tube or in SP3 96-well plate were compared.
