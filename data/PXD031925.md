### Title
Measuring the tolerance of the genetic code to altered codon size

### Description
Measurement of the amino acid incorporation of tRNAs engineered to decode four-base codons.

### Sample Protocol
A qtRNA (for example, https://benchling.com/s/seq-BpqbupgoHvZu0gFmNUBm) was co-expressed with C-terminal 6xHis-tagged sfGFP (for example, https://benchling.com/s/seq-bI1bixktGKegGwboMYIP) with the appropriate quadruplet codon replacing permissive tyrosine residue sfGFP-15124 in S2060 cells. GFP was purified from these cultures at either 4mL or 1L scale. Samples were trypsin digested and measured using HPLC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
To analyze the results, the resulting fragmentation spectra were correlated against a custom database containing the predicted fragmentation pattern for the fragment straddling residues 151 if it contained each of the 20 canonical amino acids. Abundance of each species was quantified by calculating the area under the curve of the ion chromatogram for each peptide precursor.
