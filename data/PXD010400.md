### Title
Screening protein predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors treatment in rheumatoid arthritis by using iTRAQ technique and investigating its mechanism through signal pathway Screening protein predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors treatment in rheumatoid arthritis by using iTRAQ technique and investigating its mechanism through signal pathway

### Description
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and disabling disease. TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated an outstanding performance in relieving joint inflammation and retarding bone erosion involved in RA. However, there is still about one-thirds of RA patients had a poor response to TNF α inhibitors. Currently the personalized biological treatment is the research hotspot. Recent studies focuses on exploring biomarkers predictive of drug response. The research methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and immunocytology, have been applied, but they are not successfully integrated. The related studies in China are still at an initial stage, which necessitates an in-depth study in this area. Our preliminary study showed that TNF-α-308 gene polymorphisms existed in Chinese RA patients and PI3K/Akt signal pathway was ativated in proliferated synovial fibroblasts stimulated by TNF-α. Therefore, for the first attempt in China, we intend to screen for differential proteins by using iTRAQ technique in RA patients receiving anti-TNF-α therapy, and then verify the predictive effects of selected differential proteins from the upstream gene polymorphism to the downstream protein expression. We will also investigate the mechanisms of differential proteins involved in TNF-α related signal pathway by using in vitro gene transfer, siRNA interference, and RA animal models. Through our study we hope to discover a prediction protein with a domestic genetic background and finally establish a prediction system with Chinese characteristics.

### Sample Protocol
Before initial administration of IFX+MTX+LEF, in addition to routine laboratory tests, 10 ml whole blood were obtained from fasting patients or healthy controls at nine o'clock in the morning with separator tubes ,then they were kept at 4 °C for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 3000 g for 3 min. The plasma supernatant was distributed into 1.8ml aliquots and stored at - 80 °C until used in latent iTRAQ study.

### Data Protocol
Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS Statistics v.22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Predictors of treatment response were identified. (ANNOVA,T-test was used to compare between groups, comparison within the group. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression analyses were used to assess predictors of treatment response. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Comparisons among multiple groups were performed via ANOVA analysis. ROC(receiver operating characteristic curve) were utilized to assess the predictive value of the Candidate biological markers.
