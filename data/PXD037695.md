### Title
Arabidopsis defensin, AtPDF1 protein detection

### Description
The goal of this project is to compare the amount of AtPDF1 protein in wild plants and amiRNA transgenic plants targeting the decrease of the 5 most similar AtPDF1 transcripts. Wild plants will be compared to two types of amiRNA transgenics, each expressing a different construct.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction:6M urea, 50mM Tris-HCl, extemporaneously @proteasecomplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (ref#4693132001) Migration of 20µg of total protein on a 15% acrylamide gel, and cutting of the 10kDa area for each sample. In gel trypsin digestion and LC-MSMS with an orbitrap exploris 280

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed with Maxquant 2.0.3.0 for identification and quantification with default parameters excepted quantification with at least 1 peptide, min score of non modified peptides = 20, match between run=true
