### Title
LC-MS/MS of YfiD-interacting proteins in mammalian cells

### Description
To figure out the intracellular function of YfiD, HA-tagged YfiD or Mock was expressed in the HeLa cell line. Subsequently, the lysates of HeLa-YfiD or HeLa-Mock cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA beads followed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
All the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Then, the whole-lane gels of HeLa-YfiD or HeLa-Mock were cut and destained. After destaining, the gel pieces were digested with trypsin at 37Â°C overnight. LC-MS/MS analyses of peptides were performed with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer based on higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometric data were analyzed using the Mascot 2.2 software (Matrix Science, UK) against proteins of Edwardsiella piscicida for database search.
