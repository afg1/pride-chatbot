### Title
Isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles from Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture and investigation of the specificities of their biogenesis

### Description
Over the past decade, membrane vesicles, known as exosomes, have garnered significant attention due to their potential as natural nanocarriers. Recently, it was discovered that plants also release extracellular vesicles (EVs). Yet, our understanding of EV production in plant cell culture remains limited. In this study, we used callus culture of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to isolate and comprehensively characterize EVs emanating from cultivated cells. Our findings reveal that the quantity of EVs in calli was significantly lower than in the plant's apoplastic fluid. This discrepancy is linked to the transcriptional repression of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) genes. While salicylic acid elevated the expression of ESCRT components, it did not boost EV production. Remarkably, EVs from calli encompass proteins pivotal for cell wall biogenesis and defense mechanisms, as well as microRNAs consistent with those in intact plants. This indicates that plant cell cultures might be a viable source of EVs reflecting the properties of the parent plant species. Nevertheless, additional research is crucial to pinpoint the optimal conditions for efficient EV production.

### Sample Protocol
Peptide mass spectra were acquired using an Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with a nitrogen laser operating in positive reflector mode. A standard method RP 700-3500 Da.par was employed to capture the mass spectra, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the desired mass range. For instrument control, FlexControl software (version 3.4; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was employed, using a nitrogen laser in automatic mode (AutoXecute—automatic Run) for analysis. External calibration of the spectra was achieved using CalibratePeptide Standards, FAMS Method, and a standard calibration mixture (Protein Calibration Standard I, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Subsequently, the Flexanalysis program version 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used for automated peak extraction. A SNAP signal detection program (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used to automatically assign the first monoisotopic signals in the spectra. Specific methods were utilized for both MS and MS/MS analyses: PMF.FAMSMethod for MS and SNAP_full_process for MS/MS. Each spectrum was generated by averaging 1500–5000 laser shots acquired at the minimum laser power (300 shots per step).

### Data Protocol
The obtained data were analyzed using the BioTools software (version 3.2; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Database searches were conducted using the Mascot search engine and m/z spectra against the Arabidopsis thaliana NCBInr and SwissProt databases. A peptide mass tolerance of 0.5 Da and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da were employed for database matching. A threshold score 40 was used to ensure reliable identification during the database search.

### Publication Abstract
Over recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs), commonly termed exosomes, have gained prominence for their potential as natural nanocarriers. It has now been recognized that plants also secrete EVs. Despite this discovery, knowledge about EV biogenesis in plant cell cultures remains limited. In our study, we have isolated and meticulously characterized EVs from the callus culture of the model plant, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Our findings indicate that the abundance of EVs in calli was less than that in the plant's apoplastic fluid. This difference was associated with the transcriptional downregulation of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) genes in the calli cells. While salicylic acid increased the expression of ESCRT components, it did not enhance EV production. Notably, EVs from calli contained proteins essential for cell wall biogenesis and defense mechanisms, as well as microRNAs consistent with those found in intact plants. This suggests that plant cell cultures could serve as a feasible source of EVs that reflect the characteristics of the parent plant species. However, further research is essential to determine the optimal conditions for efficient EV production in these cultured cells.
