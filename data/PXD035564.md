### Title
Gilvimarinus xylanilyticus strain HB14T,LC-MSMS

### Description
Strain HB14T was cultivated on 1,3-xylan and Detected its extracellular 1,3-xylanases.

### Sample Protocol
Strain HB14T was cultivated on 1,3-xylan at 30°C for 60 h, and then 20 mL of the culture was collected and centrifuged (12,857 g for 10 min at 4°C). The supernatant was moved into an ultrafiltration tube (molecular weight cut-off, 3 kDa) and centrifuged at 4,476 g and 4°C. Then, the concentrated sample (300 µL) was sent for secretome analysis at Applied Protein Technology (Shanghai, China). In brief, the sample was reduced by dithiothreitol, alkylated by iodoacetamide and digested by trypsin.

### Data Protocol
Then, peptides in the sample were desalted for LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatograph-mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy) analysis. Finally, the raw data was analyzed by Thermo Scientific Proteome DiscovererTM 1.4 with the genomic data of strain HB14T as the database.
