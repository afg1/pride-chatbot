### Title
Establishment of pancreatic cancer cells spectral library based on data-independent acquisition strategy and the phenotype analysis of pancreatic cell lines of the sensitivity and resistance of gemcitabine

### Description
Based on data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics, we first established a high-coverage human pancreatic cells spectrum library. Furthermore, analyzed the sensitivity and drug resistance phenotypes to gemcitabine (GEM).

### Sample Protocol
Seven commonly used human pancreatic cell lines were selected for the generation of the spectral library: pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, HPAC, PANC-1; human pancreatic stellate cells HPaSteC (HPSC) and human normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells HPDE6-C7 (H6C7).

### Data Protocol
A total of 84 original MS data files were collected for the pre-separation of peptide fractions. Based on the DIA pancreatic cell spectrum library, we analyzed the proteomics of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells before and after GEM treatment. CCK-8 cytotoxicity test combined with proteomics data to analyze GEM sensitivity and drug resistance phenotype.
