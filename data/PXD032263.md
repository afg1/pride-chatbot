### Title
Pancreatic cells spectral library by the DIA strategy and the phenotype analysis of gemcitabine-sensitive

### Description
Data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS) based proteome strategies is increasingly used for detecting and validating protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, by in-depth proteome analysis of 7 pancreatic cell lines, we built a pancreas-specific mass spectrum library containing 10633 protein groups and 184551 peptides.

### Sample Protocol
Here, by in-depth proteome analysis of 7 pancreatic cell lines, we built a pancreas-specific mass spectrum library containing 10633 protein groups and 184551 peptides.

### Data Protocol
The proteome difference among the 7 pancreatic cells were significant, especially for the divergent expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell lines.
