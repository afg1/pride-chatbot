### Title
Human platelet-derived extracellular vesicle proteome

### Description
The effect of size exclusion chromatography on the proteome of human platelet-derived extracellular vesicles was investigated.

### Sample Protocol
Medical -grade platelet concentrates from healthy donors were subjected to EV isolation by the ‘Total Exosome Isolation Kit from plasma’ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or a two-step ultracentrifugation approach at 20000 g and 100000 g, respectively. In an additional approach, EVs after ultracentrifugation were further processed applying size exclusion chromatography.Three independent preparations of of exosome EV samples before and after SEC corresponding to 600 ng protein were subjected to clean up via SDS-PAGE, reduction, alkylation, and in-gel tryptic digest. One third of the digests was analysed by LC-MS/MS. Chromatography was carried out on an Ultimate 3000 RCS Nano Dionex system equipped with an Ionopticks Aurora Series UHPLC C18 column (250 mm x 75 µm, 1.6 µm) (Ionopticks, Parkville, Australia). Solvent A was 0.1 % formic acid in water and solvent B acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid. Total LC-MS/MS run per sample was 136.5 min with the following gradient: 0-5.5 min: 2 % B; 5.5-65.5 min: 2-17 % B; 65.5-95.5 min: 25-37 % B, 105.5-115.5 min: 37-95 % B, 115.5-125.5 min: 95 % B; 125.5-126.5 min: 95-2% B; 126.5-136.5 min: 2% B at a flow rate of 400 nl/min and 50 °C. The timsTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) was operated in positive mode with enabled trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS) at 100 % duty cycle (100 ms cycle time). Scan mode was set to parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation (PASEF) for the scan range of 100 – 1700 m/z. Source capillary voltage was set to 1500 V and dry gas flow to 3 L/min at 180 °C.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data was subjected to MaxQuant(v1.6.17.0)Andromeda search of the Uniprot human database containing common contaminants (20467 entries) using 1% PSM and protein FDR as threshold for identification (including carbamidomethylation on Cys as fixed, oxidation on Met and acetylation on protein N-terminus as variable modifications, minimum peptide length 7 amino acids) and minimum 2 ratios of unique and razor peptides for label free quantification (LFQ). LFQ values were log2 transformed and subjected to statistical analysis using Perseus (v1.6.12.0.).  Prior statistical testing the matrix was filtered for common contaminants and to keep only those protein with reported valid values in at least x 3 samples in at least one group. Missing values were then imputed from a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 1.8. A Two-sample t-tests corrected for multi-testing were was performed between the groups (permutation-based FDR 5 %, S0=2).

### Publication Abstract
The emerging role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers and their envisioned therapeutic use require advanced techniques for their detailed characterization. In this context, we investigated gas-phase electrophoresis on a nano electrospray gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analyzer (nES GEMMA, aka nES differential mobility analyzer, nES DMA) as an alternative to standard analytical techniques. In gas-phase electrophoresis, single-charged, surface-dry, native, polydisperse, and aerosolized analytes, e.g., proteins or bio-nanoparticles, are separated according to their electrophoretic mobility diameter, i.e., globular size. Subsequently, monodisperse particles are counted after a nucleation step in a supersaturated atmosphere as they pass a focused laser beam. Hence, particle number concentrations are obtained in accordance with recommendations of the European Commission for nanoparticle characterization (2011/696/EU from October 18th, 2011). Smaller sample constituents (e.g., co-purified proteins) can be detected next to larger ones (e.g., vesicles). Focusing on platelet-derived EVs, we compared different vesicle isolation techniques. In all cases, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed the presence of vesicles. However, nES GEMMA often revealed a significant co-purification of proteins from the sample matrix, precluding gas-phase electrophoresis of less-diluted samples containing higher vesicle concentrations. Therefore, mainly peaks in the protein size range were detected. Mass spectrometry revealed that these main contaminants belonged to the group of globulins and coagulation-related components. An additional size exclusion chromatography (SEC) step enabled the depletion of co-purified, proteinaceous matrix components, while a label-free quantitative proteomics approach revealed no significant differences in the detected EV core proteome. Hence, the future in-depth analysis of EVs via gas-phase electrophoresis appears feasible. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)with/without additional size exclusion chromatographic (SEC) purification were subjected to nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and gas-phase electrophoresis (nES GEMMA). The latter revealed presence of co-purified proteins, targetable via mass spectrometry (MS). MS also revealed that SEC did not influence EV protein content. To conclude, nES GEMMA is a valuable tool for quality control of EV-containing samples under native conditions allowing for detection of co-purified proteins from complex matrices.
