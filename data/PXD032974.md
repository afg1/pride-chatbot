### Title
Characterization of WSD-0922 Signaling

### Description
The present pre-clinicial study sought to evaluate the novel EGFR inhibitor WSD-0922. We employed flank and orthotopic patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to characterize WSD-0922 and compare its therapeutic efficacy to erlotinib, a potent EGFR inhibitor that failed to provide clinical benefit for GBM patients.  We utilized phosphotyrosine mass spectrometry analyses to measure the impact of each drug on receptor activity and cellular signaling networks.

### Sample Protocol
Tumors were homogenized by sonication in 8â€‰M urea and lysates were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin overnight. Digested peptides were desalted using C18 cartridges (Waters) and were labeled with TMT 10plex or 11plex isobaric mass tags. For phosphotyrosine analysis, peptides were subjected to a two-step enrichment process: anti-phosphotyrosine IP followed by Fe-NTA spin column IMAC purification. Eluates were then subjected to LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer version 2.5.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and searched against the human SwissProt database using Mascot version 2.4 (Matrix Science)
