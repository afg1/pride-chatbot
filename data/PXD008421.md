### Title
TMT10-TAILS for monitoring MALT1 substrate cleavage

### Description
We used TMT-TAILS to monitor MALT1 substrate cleavage in normal EBV B lymphocytes stimulated with PMA/ionomycin to evaluate kinetic profiles of MALT1 inhibitors

### Sample Protocol
B cell proteomes were collected after incubation with increasing concentrations of inhibitor and stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Proteins were labeled with TMT-10 at the protein level and N-terminal peptides were enriched using the TAILS methodology. Enriched termini were analyzed on a nanoLC-Orbitrap Lumos platform.

### Data Protocol
Spectra were matched against a human Uniprot database using Proteome Discoverer 2.0 with a Byonic search node integrated. Protein-level FDR was set at <1%, quantification at the peptide level was performed using the insentity of the TMT reporter ions in SPS-MS3 mode.
