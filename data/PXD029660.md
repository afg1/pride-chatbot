### Title
Secretome analysis of mouse prosate organoids

### Description
The objective of the experiment was to compare the secretome of wild type mouse prostate oganoids (WT-mPrOs) to the one obtained from mPrOs bearing a doxycycline inducible ERG expression vector system  (ERGM40 mPrOs).

### Sample Protocol
Secretome enrichment from conditioned medium was based on click-chemistry (AHA protocol). Secreted proteins were captured on a solid support, digested on-beads and finally identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of trypic pepides. Label-free quantification in data-dependent mode was used for relative comparison of protein amounts. Four different sample groups were analyzed: WT-mPros treated with doxycycline (WT-dox), or left untreated (WT-M), and ERGM40 mPrOs treated with doxycycline (EG-dox), or left untreated (ERG-M). Four independent biological replicates fo each condition were analyzed over six months.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant v1.6.2.6a LFQ. Imputation and t-test (FDR<0.2 according to BH) were peforme in Perseus v6.2.1
