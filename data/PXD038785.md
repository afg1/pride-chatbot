### Title
In vivo characterization of the bacterial intramembrane-cleaving protease RseP using the heme binding tag-based assay iCliPSpy

### Description
Purified, putative unprocessed and processed MBPmut-TNFa fusion proteins were analyzed by LC-MS. The average molecular weights of the eluted MBPmut-TNFa fusion proteins obtained by deconvolution of the ESI-MS spectra are given. For MBPmut-TNFa preparations from “Empty vector control” and “RseP-Myc H22F”, we found a protein eluting at 9.1 with an average molecular weight of about 45448 Da min, which was higher than expected for a MBPmut-TNFa fusion protein and was therefore not further characterized. Compounds eluting at retention times above 9.5 min (corresponding to 90 % acetonitrile) were contaminants not further characterized. a to e belong to one experiment, and the processing specificity of RseP wt was confirmed in this experiment by analysis of RsePMyc wt. The C-terminal sequences of the substrate MBPmut- … CPFLSLFSFL39 fusion protein and processing product MBPmut- … CPFLSLF36 were confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Intact mass analysis of MBP-TNF fusion protein Intact masses of each fusion protein proteoform were determined using reversed phase UHPLC coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP-ESI-MS). Briefly, RP separation was performed on a 1290 UHPLC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a PLRP-S column (1.0 x 50 mm, 5 µm, 1000 Å; Agilent Technologies) at 80 °C and 0.35 mL/min. Solvent A was 0.1% FA in water. Solvent B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. Total run time was 17 min and the gradient was as follows. 0-0.5 min: 20% B, 0.5-8.5 min:  linear increase from 20% to 50% B, 8.5-9.0 min: linear increase from 50% to 90% B, 9.0-11.0 min: 90% B, 11.0-11.5 min: linear decrease from 90% to 20% B, and 11.5-17 min: re-equilibration at 20% B. MS analysis was performed (min 4 to 13) in positive polarity scan mode on an Impact II ESI-QqTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), in a mass range from m/z 600 to 7000. Following ESI source parameters were used: end plate offset 500 V, capillary voltage 4500 V, nebulizer gas 3.0 bar, dry gas 12.0 l/min, dry temperature 300 °C. High mass calibration was performed using cesium fluoroheptanoate in enhanced quadratic calibration mode. Peptide analysis of MBP-TNF fusion protein Trypsin digest was done by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) with some modifications: Proteins were denatured, reduced and alkylated on a 10K MWCO filter (PALL Corporation) and afterwards digested with 400 ng trypsin for 1h. 75 µL of the sample solution with 1 µg/uL were mixed with 500 µL 8 M urea and loaded onto the filters. After that, filters were washed once with 500 µL and spun down at 12,500 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Reduction and alkylation was performed in PreOmics lyse buffer for 20 min at 52 °C (PreOmics, Munich). For digestion, 400 ng of modified trypsin (Promega) was added in 100 µL lyse buffer. Peptide purification was performed according to the PreOmics iST protocol. RP separation was done on a 1290 UHPLC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an ACQUITY peptide CSH C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 µm, 130 Å; Waters Corporation) at 40 °C and 0.2 mL/min. Solvent A was 0.1% FA in water. Solvent B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. Total run time was 53 min, and the gradient was as follows. 0-8.0 min: 2% B, 8.0-38.0 min: linear increase from 2% to 40% B, 38.0-41.0 min: 90% B, 41.0-42.0 min: linear decrease from 90% to 2% B, 42.0-53.0 min: 2% B. MS analysis was performed on an Impact II ESI-QqTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in auto MS/MS mode and positive polarity, in a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z. The following ESI source parameters were used: end plate offset 500 V, capillary voltage 4500 V, nebulizer gas 2.0 bar, dry gas 8.0 l/min, dry temperature 250 °C. Auto MS/MS parameters are as follows: cycle time 2.0 sec, absolute threshold 500 cts per 1000 sum, Collision energy was 7eV.

### Data Protocol
Intact mass analysis of MBP-TNF fusion protein: Mass spectra were processed in DataAnalysis software version 4.4 (Bruker Daltonics). Masses were determined using maximum entropy charge deconvolution in a range of 10,000 – 50,000 Da. Peptide analysis of MBP-TNF fusion protein: LC-MS/MS spectra were processed using PEAKS Studio X pro software (PEAKS Studio 10.6 build 20201221, Bioinfor¬matics Solutions, Canada). Peptides were evaluated with a precursor mass tolerance of 30 ppm and a MS/ MS fragment tolerance of 0.05 Da.  Semi-specific trypsin specificity was selected, meaning that either the peptide N or C terminus was allowed a non-specific cleavage, maximum number of missed cleavages 4, and the following modifications: carbamidomethylation at Cys, monomethylation at Met, His Trp, dioxi¬dation at Met, deamidation at Asn and Gln, pyro-Glu from Glu and Gln, internal disulfides at Cys, carbamylation at peptide N-termini,  a maximum of 3 variable modifications were allowed per peptide. A custom database containing the TNF alpha protein was searched. Label-free quantification (LFQ) values for the listed peptides were manually extracted from the search result, and the percentage distribution in the sample was calculated.

### Publication Abstract
Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) describes the protease-dependent cleavage of transmembrane proteins within the hydrophobic core of cellular membranes. Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CliPs) that catalyze these reactions are found in all kingdoms of life and are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including signaling and protein homeostasis. I-CLiPs are multispanning membrane proteins and represent challenging targets in structural and enzyme biology. Here we introduce iCLiPSpy, a simple assay to study I-CLiPs in vivo. To allow easy detection of enzyme activity, we developed a heme-binding reporter based on TNF&#x3b1; that changes color after I-CLiP-mediated proteolysis. Co-expression of the protease and reporter in Escherichia coli (E. coli) results in white or green colonies, depending on the activity of the protease. As a proof of concept, we use this assay to study the bacterial intramembrane-cleaving zinc metalloprotease RseP in vivo. iCLiPSpy expands the methodological repertoire for identifying residues important for substrate binding or activity of I-CLiPs and can in principle be adapted to a screening assay for the identification of inhibitors or activators of I-CLiPs, which is of great interest for proteases being explored as biomedical targets.
