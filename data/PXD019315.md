### Title
Exoproteomes of marine cyanobacteria grown under different regimes to detect their pili production; analysed by LC-MS/MS

### Description
Exoproteome and cellular proteome generated from Synechococcus sp. WH7803 and its pili mutant.

### Sample Protocol
Synechococcus sp. WH7803 and pili mutant (knockout deletion of genes WH7803_1795 and WH7803_1796) were grown in ASW medium using conditions previously described [Christie-Oleza et al 2017 Nat Microbiol.]. Experiments were performed using 20 ml cultures contained in Falcon 25cm² rectangular cell culture flasks with vented caps. Cultures were incubated at 22 °C at a light intensity of 10 μmol photons m−2 s−1 with shaking (140 r.p.m.). 20 ml of cultures were centrifuged at 4,000 xg for 15 min at 21 °C and supernatants were further filtered through 0.2 um filters to remove all cells. Exoproteomes were concentrated using a trichloroacetic acid precipitation protocol [Christie-Oleza et al 2010 Marine Drugs]. Precipitated exoproteomes and cell pellets were resuspended with LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen), run on a SDS-PAGE gel and prepared for LC-MS/MS via an in-gel trypsin digestion as previously described [Christie-Oleza et al 2017 Nat Microbiol]. Tryptic peptides were analysed with an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex), using conditions described [Christie-Oleza et al 2017 Nat Microbiol].

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were identified using Synechococcus sp. WH7803 UniProt databases (downloaded on 09/11/2017) and quantified using default parameters in MaxQuant v1.6.10.43. Comparative proteomic analyses were performed using MS intensity values in Perseus v1.6.2.2.
