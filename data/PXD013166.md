### Title
Identification of key pro-survival proteins in the isolated colonic goblet cells of Winnie, a murine model of spontaneous colitis

### Description
A proteomics comparison of goblet cell extracts prepared from control mice and animals expressing a misfolding mutant of Muc2, the major secretory product of goblet cells.

### Sample Protocol
Goblet cells collected from control and Winnie colonic tissue, lysed by sonication in urea/thiourea buffer and digested with trypsin using standard protocols. Peptides were analysed using U3000 RSCLnano and LTQ-Orbitrap MS.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant pipeline for protein identification and label-free quantitation
