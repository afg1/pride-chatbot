### Title
Multiomic approaches for thyroid cancer diagnosis

### Description
Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy; however, its diagnosis is not straightforward. The current gold standard for diagnosing thyroid cancer is fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), but when cytological analysis does not provide viable results or samples belong to less defined categories of diagnosis, patients are often referred to diagnostic surgery. Given that not all these nodules require removal, nor all of them are malignant, patients would not necessarily require surgery had the initial FNAB diagnosis been more conclusive. There is therefore a lack of reliable and specific biomarkers for thyroid cancer malignancy, that can complement and improve the current diagnosing methods. “Omics” approaches have gained much attention in the last decade in the field of biomarker discovery for diagnostic and prognostic characterization of various pathophysiological conditions. In this project, proteomics and metabolomics approaches were applied to the same thyroid nodules from patients with benign and malignant lesions.  Tissue analysis provided several interesting biomarkers by both proteomics and metabolomics. The combination of these results demonstrated the high energetic and biomass demand of cancer cells, as well as a biomarker panel including 2 free peptides and 2 proteins with high sensitivity and specificity. Together, these results have contributed to increasing the knowledge of thyroid cancer phenotype and corresponding biochemical profiles, as well as providing potential biomarkers for malignancy, and improving diagnostic methodologies.

### Sample Protocol
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Centro Hospitalar de São João/Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto (approval ID 125/18). This study comprised 2 main groups, benign (B=60) and malignant (M=11). Other samples were excluded if they were benign but adjacent to other malignant findings (ExcludedadjacentM=4 or Excludedadjacentmicrocarcinoma=4), thyroiditis (T=2), noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP=1) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC=3). Malignant samples were further divided into papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC=10) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC=1). Tissue samples were obtained during surgical resection and immediately stored at -80 C until analysis. The final diagnosis was obtained after a postoperative histopathological examination of the same tissue material. Approximately 10-20mg of samples were extracted from the frozen tissue and placed in 100μL 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate solution with protease inhibitors. Samples were homogenized with the Dispersing-aggregates POLYTRON® PT1200 E with a 3mm tip. The homogenised mixture was then centrifuged at 5000×g for 5min at 4 C. Supernatant was harvested, with 5μL being used for total protein content assessment with the Pierce™ 660nm Protein Assay Reagent. Approximately 100μg was harvested from each sample to continue sample processing. Two pools for benign lesions and one for malignant lesions were created by combining part of the samples. To each sample, 2μg of the recombinant green fluorescent protein and maltose-binding periplasmic protein were added (PMID: 31450411), as well as a mix of labelled small molecules to serve as metabolomics internal standards. Protein precipitation was performed using 400μL of cold methanol following centrifugation at 20,000×g for 20min at 4 C. The pellet was resuspended in 30μL of 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer, followed by incubation at 95 C for 5min and cysteine alkylation with acrylamide. Samples were subjected to in-gel digestion using the Short-GeLC (PMID: 25418953). Samples were analyzed on a NanoLC™ 425 System (Eksigent®) coupled to a TripleTOF™ 6600 System (Sciex®) using IDA for each fraction of the pooled samples for protein identification and SWATH-MS acquisition of each individual sample for protein quantification. The mass spectrometer was operated by Analyst® TF 1.8.1 software (Sciex®). Samples were loaded onto a YMC-Triart C18 Capillary Guard Column”1/32" (12 nm, S-3µm, 5 x 0.5mm) (YMC) at 5µL/min of 5% of mobile phase B during 8 min and the peptides separation was carried out by micro-flow liquid chromatography using a YMC-Triart C18 Capillary Column (12nm, S-3 µm, 150 × 0.3 mm) (YMC) at 50°C. The flow rate was set to 5μL/min and mobile phases A and B were 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus 0.1% formic acid in water and 5% DMSO plus 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, respectively. The LC program was performed as followed: 5–30% of B (0–50min), 30–98% of B (50–52min), 98% of B (52-54min), 98-95% of B (54–56min), 95% of B (56–65min). Peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer using an electrospray ionization source (DuoSpray™ Source, ABSciex®) with a 25μm internal diameter hybrid PEEKsil/stainless steel emitter (ABSciex®). The ionization source was operated in the positive mode set to an ion spray voltage of 5500V, 20psi for nebulizer gas 1 (GS1), 15psi for nebulizer gas 2 (GS2), 25psi for the curtain gas (CUR), and source temperature (TEM) at 100°C. For IDA experiments, the mass spectrometer was set to scanning full spectra (m/z 350-2250) for 250ms, followed by up to 100 MS2 scans (m/z 100–1500) per cycle, to maintain a cycle time of 3.295s. The accumulation time of each MS2 scan was adjusted per the precursor intensity (minimum of 25ms for precursor above the intensity threshold of 2000). Candidate ions with a charge state between +1 and +5 and counts above a minimum threshold of 10 counts per second were isolated for fragmentation and one MS2 spectrum was collected before adding those ions to the exclusion list for 15s. The rolling collision was used with a collision energy spread (CES) of 5. For SWATH-MS experiments, the mass spectrometer was operated in a looped product ion mode (PMID: 22261725) with the same chromatographic conditions used in the IDA run described above. A set of 160 windows of variable width (containing an m/z of 1 for the window overlap) was constructed covering the precursor mass range of m/z 350-2250. A 50ms survey scan (m/z 350-2250) was acquired at the beginning of each cycle and SWATH MS2 spectra were collected from the precursors ranging from m/z 350 to 2250 for m/z 100–1500 for 20ms resulting in a cycle time of 3.3s The collision energy (CE) applied to each m/z window was determined considering the appropriate CE for a +2 ion centered upon this window and the collision energy spread was also adapted to each m/z window.

### Data Protocol
A specific library of precursor masses and fragment ions was created by combining all files from the IDA experiments (the 5 fractions from the 3 pools) to be used for subsequent SWATH processing. Peptide identification and library generation were performed with ProteinPilot™ 5.0 software (Sciex), using the following parameters: i) search against a database composed by the Uniprot’s Homo sapiens proteome (downloaded in March 2021) and malE-GFP (internal standard) ii) acrylamide alkylated cysteines as fixed modification; iii) trypsin as digestion enzyme. An independent False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis, using the target-decoy approach provided by ProteinPilot™, was used to assess the quality of the identifications and confident identifications were considered when identified proteins reached a 5% local FDR (PMID: 18700793, 19523214). Data processing for quantification was performed using the SWATH™ processing plug-in for PeakView™ 2.2 (ABSciex®). After retention time (RT) adjustment using the malE-GFP peptides, up to 20 peptides, with up to 5 fragments each, were chosen per protein, and quantitation was executed for all proteins identified from the ProteinPilot™ search. Peptides’ confidence threshold was determined based on an FDR analysis using the target-decoy approach and those that met the 1% FDR threshold in at least two biological replicates were retained, and the peak areas of the target fragment ions of those peptides were extracted across the experiments using an extracted-ion chromatogram (XIC) window of 5min with 100ppm XIC width. Protein’s relative abundance was estimated by summing all the filtered transitions from all the filtered peptides for a given protein and normalized to the sum of all quantified proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. Although most thyroid nodules are benign, given the high incidence of thyroid nodules in the population, it is important to understand the differences between benign and malignant thyroid cancer and the molecular alterations associated with malignancy to improve detection and signal potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets. Proteomics analysis of benign and malignant human thyroid tissue largely revealed changes indicating modifications in RNA regulation, a common cancer characteristic. In addition, changes in the immune system and cell membrane/endocytic processes were also suggested to be involved. Annexin A1 was considered a potential malignancy biomarker and, similarly to other annexins, it was found to increase in the malignant group. Furthermore, a bioinformatics approach points to the transcription factor Sp1 as being potentially involved in most of the alterations seen in the malignant thyroid nodules.
