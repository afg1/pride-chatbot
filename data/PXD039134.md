### Title
Cyclohexamide sensitive Sis1 interactome during heat shock

### Description
Translation depnedent interactome of Hsp70 co chaperone Sis1 during heat shock.

### Sample Protocol
Sis1-3xFLAG yeast were cryo-lysed at 6Ã—90sx30Hz pulses in a Retsch MM100 mixer mill under liquid nitrogen. Samples were dissolved in physiological buffer. Sis1-3xFlag were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag M2 Magnetic beads. from the cell lysates. Bead-bound complexes were released with competition for 3xFlag peptide. Eluate were submitted for mass spec at the Nothwestern University Proteomics Core.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed at the Nothwestern University Proteomics Core.
