### Title
The proteome and lipidome of extracellular vesicles from Haemonchus contortus to underpin explorations of host-para-site cross-talk

### Description
Many parasitic worms have a major adverse impact in human and animal populations worldwide due to the chronicity of their infections. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are intimately involved in modulating (suppressing) inflamma-tory/immune host responses and parasitism. As one of the most pathogenic nematodes of livestock animals, Haemonchus contortus is an ideal model system for EV exploration. Here, employing a multi-step enrichment process (in vitro culture, followed by ultracentrifugation, size exclusion and filtration), we enriched EVs from H. contortus and undertook the first comprehensive (qualitative and quantitative) multi-omic investigation of EV proteins and lipids using advanced liquid chro-matography–mass spectrometry and informatic methods. We identified and quantified 561 proteins and 446 lipids in EVs, and compared these molecules with those of adult worms. We identified unique molecules in EVs, such as proteins linked to lipid transportation and lipid species (i.e. glyc-erophospholipids and sphingolipids) associated with signalling, indicating an involvement of these molecules in parasite-host cross-talk. This work provides a solid starting point to explore the func-tional roles of EV-specific proteins and lipids in modulating parasite-host cross talk, and the pro-spect of finding ways of disrupting or interrupting this relationship to suppress or eliminate para-site infection.

### Sample Protocol
Total lipids in EVs and in adult worms were extracted using an established monoph-asic extraction protocol [64]. Briefly, samples of EVs (50 μg of protein) or worms (8 mg body weight) were individually transferred to Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL) each containing 20 μL or 200 μL of ice-cold 40% (v/v) methanol, with 10 μL of isotope labelled internal lipid standards solution (330710X, Mouse SPLASH® LIPIDOMIX, Merck, USA). Samples (four replicates representing each EVs and adult worms) were homogenised with 100 μL of 0.5 mm zirconium oxide beads (ZROB05, Next Advance, USA) in a blender (Bead Bul-let, Next Advance, USA) for 3 cycles (30 sec on – at speed 8; and 30 sec off – on ice). Then, 700 μL of 0.74/1/2 (v/v/v) water/chloroform/methanol were added to each homogenised sample. The tubes were vortexed for 60 sec and incubated on a ThermoMix (Eppendorf, Germany) at 1,000 xg for 30 min at 22 °C, and then centrifuged at 14,000 xg for 15 min. The supernatant was then transferred to another tube, and 400 μL of 1/2 (v/v) chloro-form/methanol were added, vortexed (10 sec) and centrifuged, as before. The supernatant was collected and combined with the supernatant from the first extraction. Individual combined lipid samples were then dried in a SpeedyVac, and each lipid pellet was re-suspended in 100 μL of 4/2/1 (v/v/v) isopropanol/methanol/chloroform containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) prior to analysis. Blank tubes with water (included as controls) were processed in the same manner.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data was searched through MS Dial 4.80. The mass accuracy settings were 0.005 Da and 0.025 Da for MS1 and MS2. The minimum peak height was 50000 and mass  slice width was 0.05 Da. The identification score cut off was 80%. Post identification was done with a text file containing the name and m/z of each standard in the SPLASH® LIP-IDOMIX® Mass Spec Standard (330710X, Avanti Polar Lipids, USA). In positive ioniza-tion mode, [M+H]+, [M+NH4]+ and [M+H-H2O]+ were selected as ion forms. In negative ionization mode, [M-H]- and [M+CH3COO]- were selected as ion forms. All lipid classes available were selected for the search. The retention time tolerance for alignment was 0.1 min. Lipids with maximum intensity less than 5-fold of average intensity in blank were removed. All other settings were default. All lipid LC-MS features were manually in-spected and re-integrated when needed. Four types of lipids, 1) lipids with only sum com-position except SM, 2) lipid identifications due to peak tailing, 3) retention time outliers within each lipid class, 4) LPA and PA artifacts generated by in-source fragmentation of LPS and PS were also removed. The shorthand notation used for lipid classification and structural representation follows the nomenclature proposed previously [65].

### Publication Abstract
Many parasitic worms have a major adverse impact on human and animal populations worldwide due to the chronicity of their infections. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are intimately involved in modulating (suppressing) inflammatory/immune host responses and parasitism. As one of the most pathogenic nematodes of livestock animals, <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> is an ideal model system for EV exploration. Here, employing a multi-step enrichment process (in vitro culture, followed by ultracentrifugation, size exclusion and filtration), we enriched EVs from <i>H. contortus</i> and undertook the first comprehensive (qualitative and quantitative) multi-omic investigation of EV proteins and lipids using advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and informatics methods. We identified and quantified 561 proteins and 446 lipids in EVs and compared these molecules with those of adult worms. We identified unique molecules in EVs, such as proteins linked to lipid transportation and lipid species (i.e., sphingolipids) associated with signalling, indicating the involvement of these molecules in parasite-host cross-talk. This work provides a solid starting point to explore the functional roles of EV-specific proteins and lipids in modulating parasite-host cross-talk, and the prospect of finding ways of disrupting or interrupting this relationship to suppress or eliminate parasite infection.
