### Title
Identification BLM phosphosites in presence or absence of lambda phosphatase

### Description
Identification of BLM phosphosites in presence or absence of lambda phosphatase. DDA analysis of purified protein

### Sample Protocol
Phosphopeptides generated from the proteolysis of BLM protein (mock or in vitro phosphorylated as described above) were subjected to mass spectrometry identification and quantification. Briefly, ~2 μg of purified BLM protein was loaded on a centrifugal unit (Vivacon 500, 10MKCO, Sartorious) and centrifuged until dryness (centrifugation 8,000 g, 15 min). After denaturation (8 M urea), reduction (5 mM TCEP) and alkylation (10 mM iodoacetamide), BLM was washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (3 centrifugation steps 8,000 g, 15 min) and overnight proteolyzed (0.2 μg trypsin [Promega] sequencing grade). Proteolysis was quenched by 0.1% TFA and dried peptides were resuspended in 10 μl 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile supplemented with iRT peptides (Biognosys) for quality control.

### Data Protocol
DDA analysis. Acquired spectra were searched using the MaxQuant software version 1.5.2.8 embedded with the Andromeda search engine against BLM and TOPBP1 sequences extended with contaminant. The search parameters were set to include only fully tryptic peptides, carbamidomethylation as static peptide modification, oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) as variable modification. The MS and MS/MS mass tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. False discovery rate of <1% was used at peptide level.
