### Title
Modulation of Serpin family levels detected by proteomics to monitor colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression

### Description
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer related-death in developed countries. The risk of death is correlated with the stage of CRC determined at the primary diagnosis and early diagnosis is associated with enhanced survival rate. Consequently, there is an interest in using proteomics technologies to identify specific markers of adenomatous polyps as well as advanced stages of CRC.This study supports the concept that serum proteins can discriminate adenoma and CRC patients from unaffected patients and highlights the value of the SERPIN family as potential biomarkers of CRC.

### Sample Protocol
For the identification of protein markers in CRC, high-throughput analysis in the serum of normal colonoscopy (N), adenomatous polyp (A), and colon cancer patients (C) was achieved using iTRAQ for the quantification and characterization of biomarkers.

### Data Protocol
LC-MSMS acquisitions were submitted to the ProteinPilot software v4.2.0 with the Paragon algorithm v4.2.0.0,1304 (AB Sciex) [15, 16]. Data were searched against the human protein database from the International Protein Index (Database: IPI v3.62, 83,947 sequences) including a list of common contaminant proteins available in ProteinPilot (156 sequences). Trypsin was chosen for cleavage specificity, iodoacetamide for cysteine alkylation, biological modifications for the ID focus and "thorough" search effort. A protein was considered to be significantly identified when 2 or more high confidence unique peptides were assigned (peptide identification with at least a 95% confidence and limited to a 5% global FDR). Differential proteins were selected with a p-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change greater than 1.5.
