### Title
Multiplexed proteome dynamics profiling of Estradiol and SERMs

### Description
Investigation of proteostatic effects of Estradiol, raloxifen and GW7604 in MCF7 cells.

### Sample Protocol
Treatment of MCF7 cells with Vehicle, Estradiol, raloxifen and GW7604 for 3, 7 or 24 h after SILAC media switch. Lysis of cells with SDS assisted by Benzonase or using 0.8 % IGEPAL CA-630 for subsequent Kinobeads affinity enrichment. Labelling of the SILAC light to heavy experiments with TMT 126 â€“ 128H and heavy to light with TMT 129L-131 and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis was performed using an in-house pipeline and searched with Mascot 2.4

### Publication Abstract
Protein degradation plays important roles in biological processes and is tightly regulated. Further, targeted proteolysis is an emerging research tool and&#xa0;therapeutic strategy. However, proteome-wide technologies to investigate the causes and consequences of protein degradation in biological systems are lacking. We developed "multiplexed proteome dynamics profiling" (mPDP), a mass-spectrometry-based approach combining dynamic-SILAC labeling with isobaric mass tagging for multiplexed analysis of protein degradation and synthesis. In three proof-of-concept studies, we uncover different responses induced by the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 versus a JQ1 proteolysis targeting chimera; we&#xa0;elucidate distinct modes of action of estrogen receptor modulators; and we comprehensively classify HSP90 clients based on their requirement for HSP90 constitutively or during synthesis, demonstrating that constitutive HSP90 clients have lower thermal stability than non-clients, have higher affinity&#xa0;for the chaperone, vary between cell types, and change upon external stimuli. These findings highlight the potential of mPDP to identify dynamically controlled degradation mechanisms in cellular systems.
