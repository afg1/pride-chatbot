### Title
Analysis of total proteome changes upon long-term treatment with Rho kinase inhibitor H1152.

### Description
We quantified protein changes associated with long-term Rho-kinase inhibition, using SILAC proteomics in conjugation with long-termH1152 treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.

### Sample Protocol
SILAC heavy and light labelled MEFs were treated for five days with H1152 vs. vehicle in duplicate (heavy vs. light as well as light vs. heavy). Cells were then lysed by 2%SDS, Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and protein concentrations were measured and balanced by BCA assay. The reciprocal labels of drug and vehicle treated lysates were then mixed 1:1, resulting in two reciprocally labelled SILAC replicates (Heavy drug + light vehicle and vice versa). The mixed lysates were then reduced by addition of 100mM DTT and boiling for 5 min, followed by trypsin digestion using Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) protocol. The digests were initially fractionated by isoelectric focusing, using an OFF-gel fractionator (Agilent, pH 3-10). The fractions were then cleaned up using C18 ziptip columns (Millipore). All samples were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer (ICR proteomics core facility).

### Data Protocol
The raw data was searched and quantified using Maxquant. All downstream data analysis was done using Perseus.

### Publication Abstract
Rho-associated kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1/2) are Rho-GTPase effectors that control key aspects of the actin cytoskeleton, but their role in proliferation and cancer initiation or progression is not known. Here, we provide evidence that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to maintain actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation and that their loss leads to cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. This phenotype arises from down-regulation of the essential cell-cycle proteins CyclinA, CKS1 and CDK1. Accordingly, while the loss of either Rock1 or Rock2 had no negative impact on tumorigenesis in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, loss of both blocked tumor formation, as no tumors arise in which both Rock1 and Rock2 have been genetically deleted. Our results reveal an indispensable role for ROCK, yet redundant role for isoforms 1 and 2, in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through the maintenance of cellular contractility.
