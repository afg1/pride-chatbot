### Title
Stool proteome of EAE mice prior to physical symtoms but after immunization

### Description
TMT-labeled shotgun proteomics of mouse stool collected before and after EAE immununization.

### Sample Protocol
Disrupt mouse stool pellet with 8M urea, pellet out microbes with ultra centrifugation, TCA precipitate proteins, gel purify (get rid of contaminants), c18 cleanup, TMT label, c18 cleanup. For control runs, samples were NOT TMT labeled.

### Data Protocol
Peptides binned into proteins using Proteome Discoverer 2.2. Summed protein intensity compared across all channels by dividing protein intensity by total channel intensity.

### Publication Abstract
Diseases are often diagnosed once overt symptoms arise, ignoring the prior latent period when effective prevention may be possible. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, exhibits such disease latency, but the molecular processes underlying this asymptomatic period remain poorly characterized. Gut microbes also influence EAE severity, yet their impact on the latent period remains unknown. Here, we show the latent period between immunization and EAE's overt symptom onset is characterized by distinct host responses as measured by stool proteomics. In particular, we found a transient increase in protease inhibitors that inversely correlated with disease severity. Vancomycin administration attenuated both EAE symptoms and protease inhibitor induction potentially by decreasing immune system reactivity, supporting a subset of the microbiota's role in modulating the host's latent period response. These results strengthen previous evidence of proteases and their inhibitors in EAE and highlight the utility stool-omics for revealing complex, dynamic biology.
