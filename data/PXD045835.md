### Title
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Heme Metabolites Biliverdin IX and IX are Integral to Lifestyle Adaptations Associated with Chronic Infection

### Description
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile opportunistic pathogen requiring iron for its survival and virulence within the host. The ability to switch to heme as an iron source provides an advantage in chronic infection. We have recently shown the extracellular heme metabolites biliverdin IX (BVIX) and/or BVIX positively regulate the heme dependent cell surface signaling cascade. We further investigated the role of BVIX and BVIX in cell signaling utilizing allelic strains lacking a functional HemO (hemOin), or one reengineered to produce BVIX (hemO). Compared to PAO1 both strains show a heme dependent growth defect, decreased swarming and twitching and less robust biofilm formation. Interestingly, the motility and biofilm defects were partially rescued on addition of exogenous BVIX and BVIX. Utilizing LC-MS/MS we performed a comparative proteomics and metabolomics analysis of PAO1 versus the allelic strains in shaking and static conditions. In shaking conditions, the hemO allelic strains showed a significant increase in proteins involved in quorum sensing (QS), phenazine production and chemotaxis.Metabolite profiling further revealed increased levels of PQS and phenazine metabolites. In static conditions we observed a significant repression of chemosensory pathways and Type IV pili (TFP) biogenesis proteins as well as several phosphodiesterases associated with biofilm dispersal. We propose BVIX metabolites function as signaling and chemotactic molecules integrating heme utilization as an iron source into the adaptation of P. aeruginosa from a planktonic to sessile lifestyle.

### Sample Protocol
For all proteomics, gene expression and metabolism studies a single colony was picked and grown overnight in 10 mL of LB broth at 37 C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 10 mL of M9 minimal media (Teknova). Following centrifugation pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 mL of M9 minimal media and used to inoculate 30 mL of fresh M9 media to a starting OD600 of 0.05. The cultures were grown at 37 C shaking for 3 h to induce iron-limitation after which either 5 M heme (Frontiers Scientific) or FeCl3 was added. Shaking cultures were grown and samples taken at various time points as specified for the proteomics, gene expression and metabolite experiments (see below). For static cultures LB-overnight cultures were diluted 1 in 1000 in M9 media and 25 l of the diluted culture was plated onto M9 agar supplemented with 5 M heme and incubated overnight at 37oC. Heme solutions were prepared as previously described.Extraction of the BVIX isomers from the supernatant was performed as previously described (64). BVIX isomers from the pellets were extracted as described for LC-MS/MS analysis and subjected to an extra purification step over a C18 Sep-Pak column. The BVIX isomer mix was dried down and stored under nitrogen in dark vials at -80oC.

### Data Protocol
Quantitative label-free proteomics analyses were performed as previously described. Gene function and pathway analysis was conducted using information from the Pseudomonas genome database, the Pseudomonas metabolome database, and the STRING database. Protein interactions were analyzed using STRING 11.5 and visualized with Cytoscape 3.8.0. A full description of the sample preparation and peptide analysis is provided in the SI Materials and Methods.

### Publication Abstract
<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a versatile opportunistic pathogen requiring iron for its survival and virulence within the host. The ability to switch to heme as an iron source and away from siderophore uptake provides an advantage in chronic infection. We have recently shown the extracellular heme metabolites biliverdin IX&#x3b2; (BVIX&#x3b2;) and BVIX&#x3b4; positively regulate the heme-dependent cell surface signaling cascade. We further investigated the role of BVIX&#x3b2; and BVIX&#x3b4; in cell signaling utilizing allelic strains lacking a functional heme oxygenase (<i>hemO</i>in) or one reengineered to produce BVIX&#x3b1; (<i>hemO</i>&#x3b1;). Compared to PAO1, both strains show a heme-dependent growth defect, decreased swarming and twitching, and less robust biofilm formation. Interestingly, the motility and biofilm defects were partially rescued on addition of exogenous BVIX&#x3b2; and BVIX&#x3b4;. Utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we performed a comparative proteomics and metabolomics analysis of PAO1 versus the allelic strains in shaking and static conditions. In shaking conditions, the <i>hemO</i> allelic strains showed a significant increase in proteins involved in quorum sensing, phenazine production, and chemotaxis. Metabolite profiling further revealed increased levels of <i>Pseudomonas</i> quinolone signal and phenazine metabolites. In static conditions, we observed a significant repression of chemosensory pathways and type IV pili biogenesis proteins as well as several phosphodiesterases associated with biofilm dispersal. We propose BVIX metabolites function as signaling and chemotactic molecules integrating heme utilization as an iron source into the adaptation of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from a planktonic to sessile lifestyle.IMPORTANCEThe opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> causes long-term chronic infection in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. The ability to scavenge iron and to establish chronic infection within this environment coincides with a switch to utilize heme as the primary iron source. Herein, we show the heme metabolites biliverdin beta and delta are themselves important signaling molecules integrating the switch in iron acquisition systems with cooperative behaviors such as motility and biofilm formation that are essential for long-term chronic infection. These significant findings will enhance the development of viable multi-targeted therapeutics effective against both heme utilization and cooperative behaviors essential for survival and persistence within the host.
