### Title
Proteomics analysis of serum from patients with invasive ductal carcinoma

### Description
Mass spectrometry was utilized to analyze enriched, low abundance proteins from patient serum, in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) breast cancer and controls with a positive mammogram and negative biospy. Proteins in each group were compared to identify IDC specific markers.

### Sample Protocol
Low abundance proteins were enriched using affinity hydrogel nanoparticles coupled with liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw spectra were searched against a human protein database using Sequest in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Peptide FDR threshold of 0.01 was used. Statistical analysis using protein PSMs, was performed using Scaffold (Proteome Software, Inc.)
