### Title
20-175-Cronan-ZheHu and 20-200-Cronan-ZHu

### Description
Analysis performed on protein samples submitted by Zhe Hu of the John E. Cronan Laboratory by the Protein Sciences Facility of the Biotechnology Center of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

### Sample Protocol
Standard trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific Fusion Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano UHPLC.  The separation was performed on a Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap RSLC (75 µm X 15 cm) C18, 2 µm, 100 Å column at 300 nL/min.  The gradient (A: 0.1% Formic acid in water, B: 0.1% Formic acid in Acetonitrile) was run over 76 minutes with the following compositions:  0-6 minutes 1-4% B, 6-51 minutes 4-35% B, 51-56 minutes 35-50% B, 56-60min 50-90% B, 60-64 minutes 90% B, 64-66 minutes 90-2% B, 66-76 minutes 2% B.  The Fusion Tribrid settings were in the Peptide mode and the Universal method with resolution of 120,000, Precursor mass range 300-1600, RF lens 60%, AGC 2.0e5, Injection Time 100 ms, Intensity threshold 5.0e3, Charge state 1-7, Exclude after 2 times in 30 sec for 60 sec, Mass tolerance ±10 ppm, Data Dependent MS2 , IT CID, Isolation 1.6 m/z, CID activation, Collision energy 35%, IT detection in Rapid Scan mode, AGC 1.0e4, All parallelizable time, maximum Injection time 60 sec, 3 seconds/cycle.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed into peak lists using Mascot Distiller 2.7.1.0 (Matrix Science) and searched using Mascot 2.7.0.1 against a custom database composed of two entries (mutant sequence and wild type host sequence).  Mascot search settings included 3 missed cleavages, no fixed modifications, oxidation (Met) variable modifications, Precursor ion mass tolerance ±10ppm, Fragment ion mass tolerance ±0.3 Da and threshold for accepting individual spectra of 13.
