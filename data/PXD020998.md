### Title
Proteome dynamics of Microbacterium oleivorans sp. A9 in response to uranium

### Description
The project is a proteomic comparison of Microbacterium sp. A9 exposed to 10 µM nitrate uranyl versus control condition without uranyl. Three sampling time points (30 min, 4h and 24h) were analyzed. The proteomics datasets presented here were obtained using a protein database derived from the Microbacterium sp. A9 complete genome.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration. After excision as a single polyacrylamide band per sample, proteins were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptide pools were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer with a 180-min gradient time.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed using MASCOT Daemon search engine, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
