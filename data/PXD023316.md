### Title
Platelet biomarkers identifying mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes patients

### Description
Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI)

### Sample Protocol
The platelet samples were completely lysed by ultrasound (120s, 4 s on and 6 s off) after adding the lysis buffer (8 M urea, pH 8.0, 1 cocktail, 1 mM PMSF), and then lysed on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 12000g for 10 minutes to obtain the pure protein solution

### Data Protocol
The dried components were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (FA), and captured with a silica gel capillary column filled with C18 resin (Varian, Lexington, MA, USA) for subsequent Q Exactive (Thermo Scientific, NJ, USA) mass spectrometer analysis. Full scan in Orbitrap mass analyzer in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, the specific parameters are set as follows: 400-1, 800 m/z, 70000 resolution; MS/MS scans (100âˆ’1800 m/z). Using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) to retrieve MS/MS data according to Uniport-human database (2020-05). The searching parameters were modified on the previous research settings (Xu et al., 2019a).

### Publication Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state examination), A&#x3b2;1-42/A&#x3b2;1-40 (&#x3b2;-amyloid), and rGSK-3&#x3b2;(T/S9) (total to Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x3b2;) revealed that mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways-related proteins were most significantly involved. Among them, only the increase of optineurin, an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously correlated with the reduced MMSE score, and the increased A&#x3b2;1-42/A&#x3b2;1-40 and rGSK-3&#x3b2;(T/S9), and the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from T2DM-nMCI. Combination of the elevated platelet optineurin and rGSK-3&#x3b2;(T/S9) enhanced the MCI-discriminating efficiency with AUC of 0.927, specificity of 86.7%, sensitivity of 85.3%, and accuracy of 0.859, which is promising for predicting cognitive decline in T2DM patients.
