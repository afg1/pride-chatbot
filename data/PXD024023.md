Proteomics in mutant KRAS Lung cancer

### Description
Proteomic studies to check the effect of MEK1/2 and KRAS G12C inhibitors in lung cancer cells

### Sample Protocol
Cellular pellets derived from H1792 cells exposed to DMSO, Trametinib (0.5 μM), Lestaurtinib (0.625 μM) or both for 48 h, and H1792-TR grown in 0.5 μM Trametinib ± Lestaurtinib for 48 h were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v), and 50 mM DTT supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenates were spinned down at 100.000 x g for 1 h at 15ºC. After protein precipitation, protein concentration was measured in the supernatants with the Bradford assay kit (Biorad).  Protein digestion and peptide TMT labeling. Four independent tandem-mass-tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic experiments were performed including biological triplicates derived from biological conditions. TMT labeling of each sample was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo). Briefly, equal amounts of protein (600 μg) from each sample were reduced with 200 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 55°C for 1 h. Cysteine residues were alkylated with 375 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min. Protein enzymatic cleavage was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:40, w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptide desalting was performed using PierceTM Peptide Desalting Spin Columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. For TMT experiments, each tryptic digest was labelled with one isobaric amine-reactive tag as follows: i) TMT-Plex-1: Tag126, control-1; Tag127, control-2; Tag128, T-1; Tag129, T-2; Tag130, L-1; Tag131, L-2; ii) TMT-Plex-2: Tag126, T-3; Tag127, M-3; Tag128, control-3; Tag129, control-4; Tag130, Comb-3; Tag131, TR-3; iii) TMT-Plex-3: Tag126, TR-1; Tag127, TR-2; Tag128, Comb-1; Tag129, Comb-2; Tag130, control-5; Tag131, control-6; Tag126, control-7; Tag127, control-8; Tag128, TRL-1; Tag129, TRL-2; Tag130, TRL-3; Tag131, control-9. After 1h incubation at room temperature, reactions were stopped with 5% hidroxilamine, labelled samples corresponding to the same plex were independently pooled, desalted and evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge.  Phosphopeptide enrichment and LC-MS/MS. Enrichment of phosphorylated peptides was performed applying the SIMAC protocol as previously described(8). Unbound peptide pools (nonmodified peptides) were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted with 40uL of 5mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) pH 9.8, and injected into an ÄKTA pure 25 system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with a high pH stable X-Terra RP18 column (C18; 2.1mm × 150mm; 3.5μm) (Waters). Mobile phases were 5mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN at pH 9.8 (buffer B) and 5mM ammonium formate in water at pH 9.8 (buffer A). Column gradient was developed in an 80 min three step gradient from 5% B to 30% B in 5 min, 30% B to 60% B in 40 min, 15 min in 60% B and 60% B to 90% B in 20 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 30 min and 2% B for 10 min. Thirty fractions were collected and evaporated under vacuum. Peptide fractions were reconstituted into a final concentration of 0.5µg/µL of 2% ACN, 0.5% FA, 97.5% MilliQ-water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Then, peptide mixtures were separated by reverse phase chromatography using an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump fitted with a 75μm ID column (Eksigent 0.075 x 250). Samples were first loaded for desalting and concentration into a 2 cm length 100μm ID precolumn packed with the same chemistry as the separating column. Mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Non-modified peptide fractions were analyzed following the following conditions. Column gradient was developed in a 135 min three step gradient from 2% B to 30% B in 90 min, from 30%B to 40% B in 10 min and from 40% to 80% in 10 min. Column was equilibrated in 97% B for 3 min and 2% B for 23 min. During all the process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using a 5600 Triple-TOF system (Sciex). Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 250 ms. The top 35 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set at 11 ms giving a total cycle time of 3.8s. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 100 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation for 15 s. In the case of fractions that contained the phosphorylated peptides, column gradient was developed in 140 min two-step gradient from 2% to 35% B in 100 min and from 35% to 70% in 20 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 5 min and 2% B for 15 min. Precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using a 5600 Triple-TOF system (Sciex) following the same conditions as the non-modified peptides.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS/MS spectra searches were processed using the MaxQuant software(9) and searched against the Uniprot proteome reference for Homo Sapiens (Proteome ID: UP000005640_9606, February 2019). The parameters used were as follows: Initial maximum precursor (25ppm) fragment mass deviations (40ppm); variable modification (methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation) and fixed modification (MMTS); enzyme (trypsin) with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage; minimum peptide length (7 amino acids); false discovery rate (FDR) for PSM and protein identification (1%). Frequently observed laboratory contaminants were removed. Protein identification was considered valid with at least one unique or “razor” peptide. The protein quantification was calculated using at least 2 razor + unique peptides, and statistical significance was calculated with a two-way Student-t test (p < 0.05). A 1.3-fold change cut-off was used. Proteins with TMT ratios below the low range (0.77) were considered to be down-regulated, whereas those above the high range (1.3) were considered to be up-regulated. Additionally, in the analysis of phosphorylated fractions, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were chosen as variable modifications for database searching. The Perseus software (version 1.5.6.0) (10) was used for statistical analysis and data visualization.
