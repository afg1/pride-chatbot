### Title
Intact Transition Epitope Mapping – Serological Inspection by Epitope EXtraction (ITEM – SIX)

### Description
Precision medicine requests accurate serological inspections to precisely stratify patients for targeted treatment. Intact transition epitope mapping analysis proved seroconversion of a model organism's serum when spiked with a monoclonal murine anti-ovalbumin antibody with epitope-resolution. Isolation of the IgG fraction from blood serum applied two consecutive protein precipitation steps followed by ultrafiltration and resulted in an ESI-MS analysis-ready IgG preparation. For epitope mapping by epitope extraction, the ovalbumin antigen was digested with trypsin. After desalting, the peptide mixture was added to the ESI-MS-ready IgG preparation from converted serum and the solution was incubated to form an immune complex between the ovalbumin-derived epitope peptide and the anti-ovalbumin antibody. Then, the entire mixture of proteins and peptides was directly electrosprayed. Sorting of ions in the mass spectrometer's gas phase, dissociation of the immune complex ions by collision induced dissociation, and recording of the epitope peptide ion which had been released from the immune complex revealed the presence of the anti-ovalbumin antibody in converted serum. Mass determination of the complex-released epitope peptide ion with isotope resolution is highly accurate, guaranteeing high specificity of this novel seroconversion analysis approach which is termed Intact Transition Epitope Mapping – Serological Inspections by Epitope EXtraction (ITEM – SIX).

### Sample Protocol
A volume of 5µl of digested ovalbumin solution with 0.32µg/µl protein concentration was obtained by dilution with 0.2M ammonium acetate, pH6.7. To this diluted ovalbumin peptide solution (solution 2a) were added 4µl of IgG extracted from converted rabbit serum (solution 1b; protein concentration 1.41µg/µl). The mixture (solution 3b) has a final volume of 9µl, a final antibody concentration of 0.63µg/µl, and a final ovalbumin peptide concentration of 0.18µg/µl. Solution 3b was incubated at room temperature for 1.5hours. A volume of 2.5µl of solution 3b was filled into a gold-coated nanospray capillary needle for offline nanoESI-MS ITEM-SIX experiments. IgG extracted from rabbit serum (solution 0) served as negative control and was diluted with 0.2M ammonium acetate, pH6.7, to a protein concentration of 0.23µg/µl (1.6pmol/µl). A volume of 2.5µl of digested ovalbumin peptide solution (solution 2') with peptide concentration of 0.055µg/µl (13.7pmol/µl) was added to 10µl of diluted IgG from rabbit serum (solution 0) to generate solution 3c. The final volume of solution 3c was 12.5µl, final IgG concentration 0.19µg/µl (1.2pmol/µl), and final ovalbumin peptide concentration 0.011µg/µl (34.0pmol/µl). After mixing, solution 3c was incubated at room temperature for at least 1.5hours. A volume of 2.5µl of solution 3c was filled into a gold-coated nanospray capillary needle for offline nanoESI-MS ITEM-SIX experiments. Offline nanoESI-MS ITEM-ONE analysis was performed as follows. Setting of capillary needle voltage was 1.4kV, cone voltage 130V, extractor voltage 3V, RF lens 1.2V. Source temperature was set to 80°C and the nitrogen sheath gas flow was set to 4psi. Multichannel plate detector voltage was set to 1950V and pusher time to 124µs. Inlet vacuum was 1.5E-1mbar, quadrupole analyzer vacuum was varied between 3.0E-5mbar and 4.4E-5mbar, the ToF analyzer vacuum was 4.5E-7mbar. Transmission of ions below m/z1450 was completely blocked via respective quadrupole settings: M1=2000, dwell time, and ramp time 25%; M2=2000, dwell time, and ramp time 25%; and M3=2000. Mass spectra were recorded in ranges from m/z500 to m/z7500. Collision gas pressure was set to 4psi and collision cell voltage difference initially was set to 3V. After 1.5 minutes of recording the collision cell voltage difference was increased to 20V.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were smoothed in 5 cycles with a window of 3 prior to determining the m/z values of unbound peptide ions in the low mass range and in 50 cycles  with a window of 100 or 150 prior the anti-ovalbumin antibody and/or its respective immune complex ions in the high mass range (see above scan number protocols)  and baseline subtracted using MassLynx version 4.0 (Waters, Manchester, UK).
