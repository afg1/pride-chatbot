### Title
Quantitative Beer SWATH-MS Proteomics

### Description
Identification and Quantification of proteins and glycoproteins in beer measured by DDA and SWATH-MS.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were taken from commercial beers, prepared by perciptation, tryptic digest, peptide desalt by C18 Ziptip, peptide identification by LC-MS/MS on TripleTof 5600, SWATH measurement with identical LC on TripleTof 5600.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification using ProteinPilot 5.1 searched against all high confidence proteins from transcripts from the barley genome, S288C proteome, and manually curated contamination database. SWATH data processed using Peakview 2.1.
