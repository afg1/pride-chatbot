### Title
Antimicrobial activity of graphene oxide is associated with alteration in stress response and membrane proteins

### Description
The aim of this study was to explore the mode of action of GO, via an in-depth proteomics analysis, on the protein expression of targeted bacteria. For this purpose, samples of Staphylococcus aureus were grown in the presence of GO and samples were collected from different growth phases to examine cell viability and to analyze the changes in protein expression.

### Sample Protocol
For quantitative proteomics analysis, samples (1 mL) were harvested after 4 h, 8 h and 24 h of bacterial growth with and without GO treatment. Harvested samples were lysed, digested and samples were run on an Easy-nLC 1200 system coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Acquired MS spectra were processed with the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.6.7.0),integrated with an Andromeda search engine. Database search was performed against a target-decoy database of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325 downloaded from UniProt (taxonomy ID 93061), containing 2,889 protein entries, and additionally including  246 commonly observed contaminants. Label free quantification was enabled with a minimum ratio count of two. Downstream bioinformatics analysis was performed using Perseus version 1.6.15.0.
