### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis of Aanthamoeba exosome-like vesicles

### Description
Quantitative proteomic analusis identified a total of 130 proteins in EVs. Among the identified proteins,hydrolases and oxidoreductases were the largest protein families in EVs.

### Sample Protocol
All samples were digested with trypsin at a 1:25 enzyme:subtrate ration at 37 degree for 16 hours.The dried peptide mixtures were reconstituted with 0.1 % formic acid to analyze by using a nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
One missed cleavage, 10 ppm mass tolerance, and 0.5 Da for CID fragment ions for peptide identification. The settings of fixed and variable modifications were carbamidomethyl and oxidized methionine/ acetyl, respectively.
