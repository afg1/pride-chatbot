### Title
Identifying the glycoproteome of Burkholderia diffusa following knockdown of glycosylation using CRISPR interference - loading control for glycopeptide enrichment

### Description
To interrogate the glycoproteome following knockdown of pglL and subsequent knockdown of glycosylation in Burkholderia diffusa through Zwitterionic Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) glycopeptide enrichment – loading control pre-enrichment

### Sample Protocol
Burkholderia diffusa cells were grown for 16 hours in the presence or absence of 1% L-Rhamnose, and 10mL of cells at stationary phase (approx. OD600nm 1.5) were harvested and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed with 4% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate lysis buffer (10mM Dithiothreitol, 100mM Tris pH 8.5) through boiling at 95*C, 2000rpm on a ThermoMixer. Protein was quantified by a BCA assay, and 1mg of protein precipitated in ice-cold acetone (1:4 protein lysate to acetone) overnight, -20 degrees Celsius. Precipitated proteins were pelleted, acetone discarded, and precipitated once more with ice-cold acetone for 4 hours. Precipitated proteins were pelleted once again, the acetone discarded, and protein pellets dried at room temperature. Proteins were resuspended in 6M Urea, 2M Thiourea in 100mM Tris (pH 8.5) followed by reduction with 10mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride and alkylation with 40mM 2 – Chloroacetamide. Following a 1hr incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, the urea/thiourea was diluted ¼ with digestion buffer (1:100 (wt/wt) trypsin in 100mM Tris, pH 8.5). Proteins were digested for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Peptides were acidified with formic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and were cleaned up using Waters Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges.  Loading control: 40ug peptides were retained as a loading control for ZIC-HILIC glycopeptide enrichment.
