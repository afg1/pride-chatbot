### Title
uDPMs in AD+CVD -  Brain ureido degenerative protein modifications are associated with neuroinflammation and proteinopathy in Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease

### Description
In this study we have profiled the temporal lobe proteome of AD+CVD subjects and age-matched controls. We have studied the occurrence of uDPMs in the particulate and soluble brain proteomes isolated and analyzed by ultracentrifugation-electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (UC-ERLIC).

### Sample Protocol
Soluble and brain proteomes were isolated as previously reported by UC-ERLIC and solubilized in different concentrartions of SDC. In-solution digestion was then performed and the proteomes were digested with trypsin.

### Data Protocol
Database search was performed using PEAKS PTMs 7.5.
