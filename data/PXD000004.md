### Title
Identification and quantification of human postmortem frontal cortex proteome with a SILAM mouse brain standard

### Description
Prefrontal cortex tissue slices from a cognitively and neurpathologically normal human subject were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Brain Bank. 300-350 mg grey matter was homogenized in 1.5 ml solution A (0.32 M sucrose, 1mM MgCl2 and 0.1mM CaCl2) with a Teflon pestle.  ~100 ?l of the homogenate was saved, solubilized with 1% SDS and clarified by centrifugation.  To prepare the [13C6]brain ISTD, 400 mg labeled MouseExpress brain tissue (Cambridge Isotopes, MA) was homogenized in 4 ml buffer A as described above, centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min to clarify, agitated on a rocker at 4�C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min.  The pellet, a crude membrane fraction, was dissolved in 2 ml 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 1% SDS. Total protein in all preparations was quantified with the micro BCA assay (Pierce) and all solutions were supplemented with protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) as well as 1 mM sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Human cortex homogenate was mixed with the [13C6]brain ISTD (1?g/?l) at a ratio of 2:1(?g/?g) and processed for LC-MS/MS: 40 ?l preparations were heated with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) (Invitrogen) buffer at 95�C for 20 min, separated on a 1.5 mm 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen), cut into five fractions, chopped into ?2 mm cubes, washed in 200 ?l 50% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 25 mM NH4HCO3, reduced in 300 ?l 10 mM DTT, alkylated in 300 ?l 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), and digested with 80-120 ?l trypsin (.025 ?g/?l) (Promega) overnight at 37�C, so that the amount of trypsin was 1:5 of the total protein to be digested by mass.  Peptides were recovered from gel cubes into 200 ?l 50/50 H2O/ACN with 3% formic acid by vortex-mixing and sonication for 20 min each, twice. Samples were then evaporated to a 100 ?l volume, brought to 1ml in H20 with 0.1% formic acid, desalted with Oasis� HLB cartridges (Waters), evaporated almost to completion and suspended in ~ 45?l H2O with 0.1% formic acid, and filtered with 0.22 �m Ultra free-MC filter cartridges (Millipore). LC-data dependant -MS/MS analyses were conducted on a Q Exactive (ThermoFisher Scientific) quadrupole orbi-trap hybrid instrument with an Easy nLC-II (ThermoFisher Scientific) nano-pump/autosampler.  3?l peptide sample (~ 1 ug) was loaded and resolved on a 20 cm x 75 �m proteopepII C18 packed tip column over a 90 min gradient at a flow rate of 350 nL/min, 0-35% mobile phase B (ACN, 0.1 formic acid).  A data-dependent top 10 method was used to acquire a 70,000 resolution full scan to trigger ten 17,500 resolution HCD scans.  Ions were isolated for MS/MS analysis with a 2.0 Da window on the quadrupole.  Average cycle times were 1.2 sec.  Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Raw files from triplicate injections were searched together within Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using SEQUEST and the human refseq. database (release 47, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/).  Search parameters allowed trypsin to cleave after Lysine and Arginine and have 2 missed cleavages.  Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 20 mmu.  The dynamic modification of methionine (oxidation = 15.995 Da) and lysine (13C6 = 6.020 Da), in addition to the static modification of cysteine (carbamidomethylation = 57.021 Da) was accepted on up to 4 residues per peptide.  Within the Proteome Discoverer Software, SILAC pairs were identified using the �2 plex� workflow node, and all peptides were rescored using the Percolator algorithm node.  Finally, peptides were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR).

### Publication Abstract
Synaptic architecture and its adaptive changes require numerous molecular events that are both highly ordered and complex. A majority of neuropsychiatric illnesses are complex trait disorders, in which multiple etiologic factors converge at the synapse via many signaling pathways. Investigating the protein composition of synaptic microdomains from human patient brain tissues will yield valuable insights into the interactions of risk genes in many disorders. These types of studies in postmortem tissues have been limited by the lack of proper study paradigms. Thus, it is necessary not only to develop strategies to quantify protein and post-translational modifications at the synapse, but also to rigorously validate them for use in postmortem human brain tissues. In this study we describe the development of a liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring method, using a stable isotope-labeled neuronal proteome standard prepared from the brain tissue of a stable isotope-labeled mouse, for the multiplexed quantification of target synaptic proteins in mammalian samples. Additionally, we report the use of this method to validate a biochemical approach for the preparation of synaptic microdomain enrichments from human postmortem prefrontal cortex. Our data demonstrate that a targeted mass spectrometry approach with a true neuronal proteome standard facilitates accurate and precise quantification of over 100 synaptic proteins in mammalian samples, with the potential to quantify over 1000 proteins. Using this method, we found that protein enrichments in subcellular fractions prepared from human postmortem brain tissue were strikingly similar to those prepared from fresh mouse brain tissue. These findings demonstrate that biochemical fractionation methods paired with targeted proteomic strategies can be used in human brain tissues, with important implications for the study of neuropsychiatric disease.
