### Title
Identification of proteins that interacted with ESCO2

### Description
The Flag–ESCO2 plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, Flag–ESCO2 complexes were co-immunoprecipitated using an anti-Flag antibody. The Flag–ESCO2 complexes was separated using SDS PAGE, and then was identified by combining silver staining and mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
The Flag–ESCO2 plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, Flag–ESCO2 complexes were co-immunoprecipitated using an anti-Flag antibody. The Flag–ESCO2 complexes was separated using SDS PAGE, and then was identified by combining silver staining and mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
The peptides identified by mass spectrometry can be retrieved from the UNIPROT database to obtain the final data.
