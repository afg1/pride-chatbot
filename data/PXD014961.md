### Title
Network of interactions between ZIKA virus non-structural proteins and human host proteins

### Description
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus and can be transmitted through an infected mosquito bite or through human-to-human interaction by sexual activity, blood transfusion, breastfeeding or perinatal exposure. After the 2015-2016 outbreak in Brazil, a strong link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly emerged. ZIKV specifically targets human neural progenitor cells, suggesting that proteins encoded by ZIKV bind and inactivate host cell proteins leading to microcephaly. Here, we present a systematic annotation of interactions between human proteins and the seven non-structural ZIKV proteins corresponding to a Brazilian isolate. The interaction network was generated by combining tandem-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry with yeast two-hybrid screens. We identified 150 human proteins, involved in distinct biological processes, as interactors to ZIKV non-structural proteins. Our interacting network is composed of proteins that have been previously associated with microcephaly in human genetic disorders and/or animal models. This study builds on previously published interacting networks of ZIKV and genes related to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly to generate a catalog of human cellular targets of ZIKV proteins implicated in processes related to microcephaly in humans. Collectively, this data can be used as a resource for future characterization of ZIKV infection biology and help create a basis for the discovery of drugs which may disrupt the interaction and reduce the health damage to the fetus.

### Sample Protocol
HEK293FT cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with the SBP-CBP-tagged NS or control (GFP) vectors. HEK cells have been previously used as a model for characterizing host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPI). About 1 x 10^8 cells were used for the purification of the protein complexes using the InterPlay TAP purification kit (Stratagene) as described previously. A nanoflow ultra high-performance liquid chromatograph (RSLC, Dionex) coupled to an electrospray bench top orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive plus, Thermo) was used for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) peptide sequencing experiments. Samples were loaded onto a pre-column and washed for 8 minutes with aqueous 2% acetonitrile with 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. Trapped peptides were eluted onto an analytical column, (C18 PepMap100, Thermo) and separated using a 90-minute gradient delivered at 300 nl/min. Sixteen tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner following each survey scan using a 15 second exclusion for previously sampled peptide peaks (QExactive, Thermo).

### Data Protocol
We used Scaffold (Version 4.8.5) to obtain the original samples report of all TAP-MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were retained if they satisfied a minimum of 95.0% threshold. Protein identifications were accepted if they met greater than 50.0% threshold with a minimum of 2 identified peptides. To further analyze the original Scaffold mass spectrometry data, we used APOSTL, an integrative Galaxy pipeline for affinity proteomics data. The following global cutoffs were applied to 7,996 interactions and generated a list of 88 high confidence interactions: SaintScore cutoff: 0.5; FoldChange cutoff: 0; NSAF Score cutoff: 0.0000025. APOSTL also interrogates the CRAPome database (http://crapome.org/), which contains common contaminants in affinity purificationâ€“mass spectrometry data. Seventeen proteins displayed a CRAPome score >90% and were candidates to be called non-specific interactors. However, two hits were plausible due to being previously implicated in microcephaly (RAB18 and NEDD1), two hits were found associated with ZIKV NS proteins in a previously published independent study (AHCYL1 and GET4). Moreover, only 2 out 17 displayed multiple interactions, suggesting that the other 15 proteins do not constitute non-specific interactors in our assay. Therefore, we decided to retain all proteins, but have indicated high CRAPome score when appropriate.

### Publication Abstract
The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus and can be transmitted through an infected mosquito bite or through human-to-human interaction by sexual activity, blood transfusion, breastfeeding, or perinatal exposure. After the 2015-2016 outbreak in Brazil, a strong link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly emerged. ZIKV specifically targets human neural progenitor cells, suggesting that proteins encoded by ZIKV bind and inactivate host cell proteins, leading to microcephaly. Here, we present a systematic annotation of interactions between human proteins and the seven non-structural ZIKV proteins corresponding to a Brazilian isolate. The interaction network was generated by combining tandem-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry with yeast two-hybrid screens. We identified 150 human proteins, involved in distinct biological processes, as interactors to ZIKV non-structural proteins. Our interacting network is composed of proteins that have been previously associated with microcephaly in human genetic disorders and/or animal models. Further, we show that the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) interacts with NS5 and modulates its stability. This study builds on previously published interacting networks of ZIKV and genes related to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly to generate a catalog of human cellular targets of ZIKV proteins implicated in processes related to microcephaly in humans. Collectively, these data can be used as a resource for future characterization of ZIKV infection biology and help create a basis for the discovery of drugs that may disrupt the interaction and reduce the health damage to the fetus.
