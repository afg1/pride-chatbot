### Title
The dimeric deubiquitinase Usp28 integrates 53bp1 and Myc functions to limit DNA damage

### Description
The oncogenic transcription factor Myc is a pleiotropic regulator of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent transcription, DNA replication and DNA damage response pathways. Myc is stringently regulated by the ubiquitin system - for example, ubiquitination controls recruitment of the elongation factor Paf1c, which is critical for several Myc functions. Curiously, a key Myc-targeting deubiquitinase Usp28 also controls cellular response to DNA damage via the mediator protein 53bp1. Usp28 forms stable dimers, but the biological role of Usp28 dimerization is unknown. We show that dimerization limits Usp28 activity and restricts recruitment of Paf1c by Myc. Expression of monomeric Usp28 leads to ectopic Paf1c recruitment and resolution of transcription-replication conflicts, accelerating DNA synthesis. Strikingly, 53bp1 selectively interacts with and stabilizes dimeric Usp28 - depletion of 53bp1 favors formation of Usp28 monomers deregulating DNA replication. Genotoxic stress disrupts 53bp1-Usp28 complexes, promotes formation of Usp28 monomers and recruitment of Paf1 by Myc. This triggers ectopic DNA synthesis during early response to genotoxins, amplifying DNA damage. We propose that dimerization of Usp28 limits aberrant replication at transcriptionally active chromatin to maintain genome stability.

### Sample Protocol
In-Gel Digestion Each gel lane was cut into 15 slices. The excised gel bands were destained with 30 % acetonitrile in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 (pH 8), shrunk with 100 % acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum concentrator (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, Germany). Digests were performed with 0.1 µg trypsin per gel band overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 (pH 8). After removing the supernatant, peptides were extracted from the gel slices with 5 % formic acid, and extracted peptides were pooled with the supernatant. NanoLC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a PicoView Ion Source (New Objective) and coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded on capillary columns (PicoFrit, 30 cm x 150 µm ID, New Objective) self-packed with ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm (Dr. Maisch) and separated with a 30-minute linear gradient from 3% to 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid and a flow rate of 500 nl/min. Both MS and MS/MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a resolution of 60,000 for MS scans and 15,000 for MS/MS scans. HCD fragmentation with 35 % normalized collision energy was applied. A Top Speed data-dependent MS/MS method with a fixed cycle time of 3 seconds was used. Dynamic exclusion was applied with a repeat count of 1 and an exclusion duration of 30 seconds; singly charged precursors were excluded from selection. Minimum signal threshold for precursor selection was set to 50,000. Predictive AGC was used with AGC a target value of 2e5 for MS scans and 5e4 for MS/MS scans. EASY-IC was used for internal calibration.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data files were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.6.2.2. Database search was performed with Andromeda, which is integrated in the utilized version of MaxQuant. The search was performed against the UniProt human database (September 2018, UP000005640, 73099 entries). Additionally, a database containing common contaminants was used. The search was performed with tryptic cleavage specificity with 3 allowed miscleavages. Protein identification was under control of the false-discovery rate (FDR; <1% FDR on protein and PSM level). In addition to MaxQuant default settings, the search was performed against following variable modifications: Protein N-terminal acetylation, Gln to pyro-Glu formation (N-term. Gln), oxidation (Met), phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, Tyr) and GlyGly (Lys). Carbamidomethyl (Cys) was set as fixed modification. Further data analysis was performed using R scripts developed in-house. Missing LFQ intensities in the control samples were imputed with values close to the baseline. Data imputation was performed with values from a standard normal distribution with a mean of the 5% quantile of the combined log10-transformed LFQ intensities and a standard deviation of 0.1. For the identification of significantly enriched proteins, boxplot outliers were identified in intensity bins of at least 300 proteins. Log2 transformed protein ratios of sample versus control with values outside a 1.5x (significance 1) or 3x (significance 2) interquartile range (IQR), respectively, were considered as significantly enriched.
