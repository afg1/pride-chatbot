### Title
Naja mandalayenses venom proteom

### Description
Proteomic identification of the Naja mandalayenses venom

### Sample Protocol
RP-HPLC fractionated venom was proteomically processed.

### Data Protocol
Raw LCD LCMSolution Shimadzu data were converted into MGF by the LCMSolution tool and then loaded into Peaks Studio V7.0 (BSI, Canada). Data were processed according to the following parameters: MS and MS/MS error mass were 0.1 Da; methionine oxidation and carbamidomethylation as variable and fixed modification, respectively; trypsin as cleaving enzyme; maximum missed cleavages (3), maximum variable PTMs per peptide (3) and non-specific cleavage (both); the false discovery rate was adjusted to ≤0.5%; only proteins with score ≥20 and containing at least 1 unique peptide were considered in this study. Data were analyzed against a Naja protein database (963 entries) compiled on Jan/20 and built by retrieving all UniProt entries associated with this taxon.
