### Title
Passage of transmissible cancers in the Tasmanian devil is due to a dominant, shared peptide motif and a limited repertoire of MHC-I allotypes

### Description
Transmissible cancers are spread via the passage of malignant cells. The survival of the Tasmanian devil, the largest marsupial carnivore, is threatened by two independent transmissible cancers, devil facial tumour (DFT) 1 and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2). To aid the development of a peptide vaccine and to interrogate how histocompatibility barriers can be overcome, we analysed the peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I molecules from the Tasmanian devil and its transmissible tumours.

### Sample Protocol
Peptides were isolated from four biological replicates of DFT1+IFN, DFT2 and Fibroblasts cells at ~1x109 cells for each replicate, containing 10 pooled fractions per replicate. An experiment on DFT2 cells only (n=3) with lower number of cells (1x108) was used to validate the data. Peptides bound to MHC-I molecules were isolated from cell lysates by immunoaffinity purification of devil 2m protein, purified by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with  and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)

### Data Protocol
Immunopetidomics data were searched against a custom database for each cell line using PEAKS® X software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada) and peptide identities determined applying a false discovery rate cutoff of 1%. The custom database was built by appending RNAseq data from DFT2 and DFT1+IFN cells (details of RNAseq provided in supplementary methods) to the reference genome for the Fibroblast cell line, “Salem” (https://www.ensembl.org/Sarcophilus_harrisii/Info/Index).

### Publication Abstract
Transmissible cancers are malignant cells that can spread between individuals of a population, akin to both a parasite and a mobile graft. The survival of the Tasmanian devil, the largest remaining marsupial carnivore, is threatened by the remarkable emergence of two independent lineages of transmissible cancer, devil facial tumour (DFT) 1 and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2). To aid the development of a vaccine and to interrogate how histocompatibility barriers can be overcome, we analysed the peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules from Tasmanian devil cells and representative cell lines of each transmissible cancer. Here, we show that DFT1&#xa0;+&#xa0;IFN-&#x3b3; and DFT2 cell lines express a restricted repertoire of MHC-I allotypes compared with fibroblast cells, potentially reducing the breadth of peptide presentation. Comparison of the peptidomes from DFT1&#xa0;+&#xa0;IFN&#x3b3;, DFT2 and host fibroblast cells demonstrates a dominant motif, despite differences in MHC-I allotypes between the cell lines, with preference for a hydrophobic leucine residue at position 3 and position &#x3a9; of peptides. DFT1 and DFT2 both present peptides derived from neural proteins, which reflects a shared cellular origin that could be exploited for vaccine design. These results suggest that polymorphisms in MHC-I molecules between tumours and host can be 'hidden' by a common peptide motif, providing the potential for permissive passage of infectious cells and demonstrating complexity in mammalian histocompatibility barriers.
