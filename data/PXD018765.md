Proteomic analysis of Collagen-VI-deficient fibroblasts

### Description
Proteomic analysis of Collagen VI-deficient fibroblasts at the level of secretome and extracellular vesicles

### Sample Protocol
Cell culture and processing for secretome analysis Fibroblasts from each patient were cultured in duplicate in 175 cm2 flasks using standard methods and conditions. In one of the flasks from each patient and when cells were at 80% confluence, ascorbic acid was added at a 25ug/mL concentration for 24 hours. In all cases, cells were grown for the last 48 hours in FBS free medium to avoid serum protein contamination in the secretome (set of proteins secreted in the medium). In addition, a protease inhibitor cocktail was added to the medium used for the analysis of the secretome. A total of 50mL of supernatant was collected after this time for secretome analysis and for isolation of EVs EVs isolation and characterisation Differential centrifugation was applied to isolate EVs. Briefly, 50mL of supernatant were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g to remove cells and large debris, then at at 2,500 g for 10 min to remove apoptotic bodies, then at at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 C, and finally at 100,000 g centrifugation for 90 min at 4 C . The pellet was resuspended in protein lysis buffer containing 100mM ABC, Ph 7.4, 6M urea and 50nM DTT except for an aliquot of each sample which was resuspended in PBS for nano tracking analysis which was used to determine EVs size and particle concentration ( Zetaview PMX110 Multiple Parameter Particle Tracking Analysis, ParticleMetrix, Meerbusch, Germany, in size mode). Vesicles were resuspended in 1x PBS and diluted to the working range of the system (106109 particle/ml).Videos were captured and analyzed with the ZetaView software (version 8.02.28, Meerbusch, Germany) using 11 camera positions, a 2-second video length, and a camera frame rate of 15 fps (for microparticles) or 30 fps (for exosomes) at 21 C.  Label free quantitative proteomics  Sample Preparation. Sample preparation and protein digestion were performed as previously described. Briefly, purified EVs or secretome protein extracts were resus4 pended in Lysis Buffer containing 7M urea, 2 M tiourea and 50mM DTT. Protein extracts were precipitated with pre-chilled acetone, and pellets dissolved in the same Lysis Buffer. For protein digestion, protein extracts were reduced with DTT 10 mM at RT for 30 min. Cysteine residues were alkylated with iodoacetamide 30 mM at RT for 30 min. Protein enzymatic cleavage was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37 C for 16 h as previously described. Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). Mass spectrometry analysis. Peptides mixtures were separated by reverse phase chromatography using an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump fitted with a 75 ?m ID column (Eksigent 0.075 x 150). Samples were first loaded for desalting and concentration into a 0.5 cm length 300 ?m ID precolumn packed with the same chemistry as the separating column. Mobile phases were 100 % water 0.1 % formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1 % cFA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a 180 min step gradient from 2 % B to 40 % B. Column was equilibrated in 95 % c B for 9 min and 5 % cB for 14 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 ml/min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using a Sciex 5600 Triple-TOF system. Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 250 ms. Top 30 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set to 100 ms giving a total cycle time of 3.8 s. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 230 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation during 15 s.

### Data Protocol
Data Analysis. MS/MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.7 (Sciex) and spectra les were processed through Protein PilotTM Software 5.1 (Sciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) [13] for database search, Progroupł for data grouping, and searched against the concatenated target-decoy UniProt human database. False discovery rate was performed using a non lineal fitting method and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global false discovery rate or better. The peptide quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC/MS software (Waters). Using the accurate mass measurements from full survey scans in the TOF detector and the observed retention times, runs were aligned to compensate for between-run variations in our nanoLC separation system. To this end, all runs were aligned to a reference run automatically chosen by the software, and a master list of features considering m/z values and retention times was generated. The quality of these alignments was manually supervised with the help of quality scores provided by the software. The peptide identifications were exported from Protein Pilot and imported in Progenesis where they were matched to the respective features. Output data files were managed using Perseus software [15] for statistical analysis and data visualization. Identifications from the reverse database, common contaminants and proteins only identified through a modification peptide were removed. Label-free intensities were then logarithmized (base 2) and the samples were then grouped. At least two valid values across the three replicates were required for each identified protein. Following the Perseus analysis pipeline, empty values were imputed with random numbers from a normal distribution to simulate low abundance values below the detection limit of the instrument. For each condition, a two-sample t-test based on p-value lower than 0.05.

### Publication Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Their content reflects the state of diseased cells representing a window into disease progression. Collagen-VI Related Muscular Dystrophy (COL6-RD) is a multi-systemic disease involving different cell types. The role of EVs in this disease has not been explored. We compared by quantitative proteomics the protein cargo of EVs released from fibroblasts from patients with COL6-RD and controls. Isolated EVs contained a significant proportion of the most frequently reported proteins in EVs according to Exocarta and Vesiclepedia. We identified 67 differentially abundant proteins associated with vesicle transport and exocytosis, actin remodelling and the cytoskeleton, hemostasis and oxidative stress. Treatment of control fibroblasts with EVs from either patient or healthy fibroblasts altered significantly the motility of cells on a cell migration assay highlighting the functional relevance of EVs. In parallel, we analysed the secretome from the same cells and found a distinctly different set of 48 differentially abundant proteins related to extracellular matrix organisation and remodelling, growth factor response, RNA metabolism and the proteasome. The EVs and secretome sets of proteins only shared two identifiers indicating that the sorting of proteins towards EVs or the secretory pathway is tightly regulated for different functions.
