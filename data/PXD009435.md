### Title
Wine grape iTRAQ

### Description
iTRAQ proteomics analysis in roots of wine grape (Beida) during overwintering have been revealed that low temperature induced differentially proteins accumulated.

### Sample Protocol
Root samples to be quantified are prepared under -4 and -15â„ƒ conditions followed by extract proteins. After using a standard protein assay to estimate the protein concentration of each sample, proteins are digested using trypsin, to generate proteolytic peptides. Each peptide digest is labeled with a different iTRAQ reagent and then the labeled digests are combined into one sample mixture. The combined peptide mixture is analyzed by LC-MS/MS for both identification and quantification.

### Data Protocol
A database search is then performed using the fragmentation data to identify the labeled peptides and hence the corresponding proteins. The fragmentation of the attached tag generates a low molecular mass reporter ion that can be used to relatively quantify the peptides and the proteins from which they originated.
