### Title
MaxQuant software for ion mobility enhanced shotgun proteomics

### Description
Ion mobility can add a dimension to LC-MS based shotgun proteomics which has the potential to boost proteome coverage, quantification accuracy and dynamic range.  Required for this is suitable software that extracts the information contained in the four-dimensional (4D) data space spanned by m/z, retention time, ion mobility and signal intensity. Here we describe the ion mobility enhanced MaxQuant software, which utilizes the added data dimension.  It offers an end to end computational workflow for the identification and quantification of peptides, proteins and posttranslational modification sites in LC-IMS-MS/MS shotgun proteomics data. We apply it to trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) analyzer. A highly parallelizable 4D feature detection algorithm extracts peaks which are assembled to isotope patterns. Masses are recalibrated with a non-linear m/z, retention time, ion mobility and signal intensity dependent model, based on peptides from the sample. A new matching between runs (MBR) algorithm that utilizes collisional cross section (CCS) values of MS1 features in the matching process significantly gains specificity from the extra dimension. Prerequisite for using CCS values in MBR is a relative alignment of the ion mobility values between the runs. The missing value problem in protein quantification over many samples is greatly reduced by CCS aware MBR.MS1 level label-free quantification is also implemented which proves to be highly precise and accurate on a benchmark dataset with known ground truth.

### Sample Protocol
Cell culture and sample preparation Whole protein extracts of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) were purchased fromPromega and digestion was performed according to the protocol of Wang et al.(25). Briefly, the protein lyophilisate was re-constituted in water and trifluoroethanol (1:1). Disulfide bonds were reduced with dithiothreitol at a concentration of 5 mM and alkylated with chloroacetamide (20mM) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer, followed by 90 min incubation in the dark. Trypsin (Promega) was added in a protease: protein ratio (wt:wt) of 1:100 and incubation was performed overnight at 37Â°C. Digestion was stopped by acidification with formic acid to pH 2 and peptides were desalted on C18 cartridges (3 M Empore) and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For the mixed species experiments, tryptic protein digests of H. sapiens (HeLa), S. cerevisiae (Promega) and E.coli (Waters) were mixed in two different experiments leading to a ratio of 1:1 (HeLa), 1:2 (S. cerevisiae) and 1:4 (E.coli) between the two samples. The human blood plasma samples were collected from acute inflammation patients and were depleted for the 12 most abundant proteins using spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The depleted plasma proteome was TCA/DOC precipitated and digested with SMART digest trypsin (Pierce) for 2h. . Peptides were desalted (SOLAÎ¼ HRP, Pierce), diluted to 5 ng/Î¼L0.1% of formic acid in water for subsequent transfer of 100 ng to Evotips.  Liquid chromatography A nanoElute (Bruker) high pressure nanoflow system was connected to the timsTOF Pro, an ion-mobility spectrometry quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker). Peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% FA and 200 ng were delivered to reversed phase analytical columns (25 cm x 75 Âµm i.d., Ion opticks) with pulled emitter tips. Liquid chromatography was performed at 50 Â°C and peptides were separated on the analytical column using a 120 min gradient (solvent A: 0.1% FA; solvent B: 0.1% FA, in ACN) at a flow rate of 400 nl/min. A linear gradient from 2-17 % B was applied for 60 min, followed by 17-25 % B for the next 30 min and followed by a step to 37% B for 10 min and a step to 80% B for 10 min followed by 10 min of washing at 80% B. For the plasma proteome samples, the Evosep One (Evosep) was used to achieve low overhead times and a high sample throughput. Separation was performed by transferring 100 ng proteolytic digest from the sample loop on short columns (8 cm x 100 Âµm i.d.) at flow rate of 1.5 Âµl/min achieving 11.5 min gradient times and the measurement of 100 samples/day.   Ion mobility mass spectrometry For all experiments, the timsTOF Pro was operated in PASEF mode. Ions entering the instrument were orthogonally deflected into an electrodynamic funnel and were trapped in the front region of the trapped ion mobility (TIMS) analyzer. The TIMS tunnel is separated into two parts (â€œdual TIMSâ€� design), allowing for accumulation of entering ions in the first part and trapped ion mobility elution in the second part. Trapped ion mobility separation was achieved by repulsion of an increasing longitudinal electric field gradient (ramp) and a drag force of incoming gas from ambient air. Dependent on the collisional cross sections and charge states high mobility ions are accumulated at the front part and low mobility ions at the end of the analyzer. To achieve close to 100 % duty cycle, we set the ramp and accumulation time for the electric field gradient to 100 ms. For each topN acquisition cycle and long nanoLC runs, one full frame and 10 PASEF MS/MS frames, each containing on average 12 MS/MS spectra, were acquired resulting in a cycle time of 1.1 s. MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded from 100 to 1,700 m/z and precursor ions for PASEF scans were selected in real time by the precursor selection algorithm. A polygon filtering was applied in the m/z and ion mobility area to exclude the low m/z of singly charged ions for PASEF precursor selection. For the 2h runs a â€˜target valueâ€™ of 20.000 was applied to repeatedly schedule MS precursors for PASEF MS/MS spectra until this intensity value is reached and an ion mobility range (1/K0) of 0.6-1.6 Vs/cm2 was used. By using one full frame and 4 PASEF MS/MS frames we have optimized data acquisition for short gradients on the Evosep system to achieve a good MS1 sampling rate for quantification at a cycle times of 0.5 s. A â€˜target valueâ€™ of 6.000 was applied to repeatedly schedule MS precursors with low intensity in digests of plasma proteomes and the ion mobility range was limited to 0.85-1.3 Vs/cm2. For all experiments the quadrupole isolation width was set to 2 Th for m/z < 700 and 3 Th for m/z > 700. Collision energy was changed in 5 steps within a TIMS elution ramp from 52 eV for 0-19% of the ramp time; 47 eV from 19-38%; 42 eV from 38-57%; 37 eV from 57-76%; and 32 eV for 76-95%.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant version 1.6.6.0 was used to perform all data analysis, which is downloadable from http://maxquant.org. MaxQuant has a plugin API for raw data access, which has been implemented for the access to Bruker TDF raw data format. MaxQuant is written in C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher) and runs on Windows and Linux operating systems(24). MaxQuant can be run interactively from a user interface or alternatively be called from the command line. Projects analyzed in MaxQuant can be automatically uploaded to the PRIDE repository as a complete submission(26).A MaxQuant help forum can be visited at https://groups.google.com/group/maxquant-list/. Bug reports should be addressed to https://maxquant.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/.  For searches with HeLa data we used human UniProt sequences (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640, version January 26, 2019) containing 73,920 proteins. All searches were performed with oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation. Values of parameters in MaxQuant have not been changed from their default values unless explicitly stated.
