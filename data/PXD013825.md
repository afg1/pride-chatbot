### Title
The identification of wt/deYdiU salmonella YdiU475aa post-translational modifications

### Description
Salmonella protein YdiU1-475aa was transformed into the ydiU knockout strain to generate the YdiU-overexpression strain.Both ΔYdiU and pYdiU strains were grown overnight in LB medium with 100 μg/ml Ampicillin,and induce YdiU expression.Then,we identity whether is any post-translational modifications for the protein.

### Sample Protocol
salmonella were harvested 4 hours later and lysed using a buffer containing 4 %SDS, 100mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 1mM DTT and lysozyme. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and quantified . Samples containing 200 μg of proteins were purified by ultrafiltration, incubated with iodoacetamide to block reduced cysteine residues, and then digested with 4 μg trypsin at 37 oC overnight. Peptides of each sample were desalted on C18 Cartridges and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 40 µl of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.

### Data Protocol
The protein needs to be fully enzymatic hydrolyzed, usually with a variety of enzymes for the enzymatic hydrolysis of protein.
