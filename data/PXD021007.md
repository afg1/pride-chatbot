### Title
Phomopsis amygdala fusicoccadiene synthase

### Description
Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdali (PaFS) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of Fusicoccin A, a diterpene glycoside and a a potential therapeutic agent. PaFS contains a C-terminal prenyltransferase domain that generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) and an N-terminal cyclase domain that utilizes GGPP to generate fusicoccadiene, which comprises the complex 5-8-5 tricyclic hydrocarbon skeleton of Fusicoccin A. The C-termimal domain octamerizes to form a central core, with the eight cyclase domains radiating outward via flexible linker segments with variable extended conformations. Crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) experiments affirm and reveal inter-domain interactions, showing that compact conformations can be achieved. These studies, complemented by cryo-EM and functional studies, provide a framework for understanding substrate channeling between consecutive catalytic domains.

### Publication Abstract
Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdali (PaFS) is a unique bifunctional terpenoid synthase that catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of the diterpene glycoside Fusicoccin A, a mediator of 14-3-3 protein interactions. The prenyltransferase domain of PaFS generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which the cyclase domain then utilizes to generate fusicoccadiene, the tricyclic hydrocarbon skeleton of Fusicoccin A. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that the structure of full-length PaFS consists of a central octameric core of prenyltransferase domains, with the eight cyclase domains radiating outward via flexible linker segments in variable splayed-out positions. Cryo-electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking experiments additionally show that compact conformations can be achieved in which cyclase domains are more closely associated with the prenyltransferase core. This structural analysis provides a framework for understanding substrate channeling, since most of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate generated by the prenyltransferase domains remains on the enzyme for cyclization to form fusicoccadiene.
