### Title
Co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-Snx33

### Description
In this project we aimed at identifying proteins interacting with Snx33. For this purpose, we have generated a Snx33 knockout cell lines with GFP-tagged full length Snx33 and GFP-tagged truncation of Snx33: dPXBAR (1-214aa) and PXBAR (159-574aa).

### Sample Protocol
For coimmunoprecipittion of GFP-tagged Snx33 and its truncation cell lines with Snx33 knockout background were used. Harvesting and lysis of dHL-60 cells  5 days after differentiation cells was performed as recommended for cytoplasmic proteins following the ChromoTek GFP-Trap Magentic Particles M-270 with protease inhibitor supplementation (#gtd, Chromotek). GFP-nanotrap beads were used to precipitate GFP-tagged proteins from the lysate (full length Snx33 and two truncations: PXBAR and dPXBAR) in a overnight rotation. Elution was performed in 2xSDS-sample buffer and submitted for mass spectrometry.
