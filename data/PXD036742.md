### Title
First paleoproteome study of fossil fish otoliths and the pristine preservation of the biomineral crystal host

### Description
Otoliths are calcium carbonate components of the stato-acoustical organ of teleost fish responsible for hearing and maintenance of their body balance. The formation of modern fish otoliths, their morphology, and the selection of calcium carbonate polymorphs is influenced by complex insoluble collagen-like protein and soluble non-collagenous protein assemblages; many of these proteins are incorporated into the aragonite crystal structure. However, the survival of these proteins has been considered unlikely in fossil otholiths. Here we report the presence of 11 fish-specific proteins (and several isoforms) in Miocene (ca. 14.8–14.6 Ma) phycid hake otoliths. These fossil otoliths were preserved in water-impermeable clays and exhibit microscopic and crystallographic features indistinguishable from modern representatives, consistent with an exceptionally pristine state of preservation. Indeed, these fossil otoliths retain ca. 10% of the proteins sequenced from modern counterparts, including proteins specific to inner ear development, e.g., otolin-1-like proteins that are involved in the arrangement of the otoliths into the sensory epithelium, and otogelin/otogelin-like proteins are a component of all the acellular membranes of the inner ear. The specificity of these proteins excludes the possibility of external contamination. Identification of a fraction of identical proteins in modern and fossil phycid hake otoliths points to highly conservative functions of inner ear biomineralization processes through time.

### Sample Protocol
Modern samples. Forkbeard (Phycis phycis, Phycidae family) modern otoliths were collected from fish caught off by fishermen along the mainland Portuguese west coast between 2011 and 2012. Sagittal otoliths were removed with ventral cranium section through gills, rinsed with water, air dried and stored in labelled plastic tubes at Lisbon Sciences Faculty (Portugal) until analyses (Vieira et al., 2013, 2014). Fossil samples. The fossil otolith samples of P. tenuis  were collected from clay deposists exposed in Korytnica, Poland. Proteome analysis. The fossil and modern otoliths were powdered, extensively oxidized in bleach/H2O2, rinsed, and dried. Cleaned powders were decalcified in 0.5 M acetic acid with all handling occurring in a laminar flow hood to minimize contamination. Soluble organic matrix (SOM) was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon, 3 kDa cutoff) and rinsed with filtered phosphate buffered saline. Insoluble organic matrix (IOM; material that pelleted at 43000 xg for 5 minutes) was three times washed washed with 80% acetone. All samples were solubilized in SDS buffer and then digested using the MED-FASP protocol on a 30 kDa Microcon Centrifugal Unit (Sigma Aldrich) after rinsing out the SDS buffer with 8 M urea (Wisniewski, 2017) by sequential applications of trypsin and then Glu-C enzymes. Samples were sequenced by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) at the UCLA Semel Institute Proteomics Facility. Each fraction was analyzed separately on a nano-liquid-chromatography system coupled to a benchtop high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer (QE-Plus; Thermo Fisher) and operated in positive ion mode with data-dependent acquisition. MS1 was performed at resolution of 70,000 (at 400 m/z) and MS2 at 17,500. Transformed mass spectra were analyzed in Mascot against the UniProt-Human database, a common contaminants database, and the Phycis phycis genome’s (Malmstrom et al., 2017) predicted protein database. The P. phycis protein database was generated using hte BRAKER pipeline, which includes the use of the GeneMark-ES/ET and Augustus programs, to predict protein coding regions of the unannotated P. phycis genome (PMID: 3102055, PMID: 26559507, PMID: 24990371. The Gadus morhua predicted protein database  (NCBI assembly GCA_902167405.1 gadMor3.0) was used to input 'hints" to guide CDS prediction (SI Document).

### Data Protocol
All samples allowed a fixed modification of carbamidomethylation on C and variable oxidation on MW, deamidation on NQ and protein N-terminal acetylation; fossil samples also allowed Phospho K & T and MOD.  For each sample, a first decoy search was carried out to determine p-values for a 1% false discovery rate. Then an error tolerant search was conducted, with the p-value adjusted if necessary. Cutoff scores were applied at the value recommended by the Mascot algorithm. Returned sequences were annotated in Blast2GO software and further run in Blast2GO against the NCBI nr primates database to test for potential human contaminants not picked up by the UniProt-Human database in Mascot; likely human contaminant proteins were excluded from the final list if they were >90% similar to primates with an e-value within 20 units of the original annotation, within 10 e-value units and 10% similarity for e-50 and lower, or within 5 e-value units and 10% similarity for e-50 and higher (Peled et al. 2020).  Duplicate sequences were checked in CD-HIT with >90% similarity; duplicates are noted separately but counted together in total protein counts.
