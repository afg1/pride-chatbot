### Title
Mass spectrometry-based profiling of histone posttranslational modifications in uveal melanoma tissue, human melanocytes, and uveal melanoma cell lines

### Description
Purpose: Epigenetic mechanisms and alterations in uveal melanoma (UM) development are still not well understood. In this pilot study, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which are epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression, were analyzed in UM formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and control tissue as well as in UM cell lines and healthy melanocytes to provide a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of UM and the potentially prognostic relevance of these molecular markers.  Methods: FFPE tissue of UM (n=24) and normal choroid (n=4) as well as human UM cell lines (n=7), human skin melanocytes (n=6) and uveal melanocytes (n=2), were analyzed by a quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) approach.

### Sample Protocol
Histones were extracted from 15-20 20 µm-thick tissue sections or 2 million cells as previously described (PMID: 31605746). Approximately 4 µg of histone octamer were mixed with an equal amount of heavy-isotope labelled histones, which were used as an internal standard (PMID: 36370272), and separated on a 17% SDS-PAGE gel. Histone bands were excised, chemically acylated with propionic anhydride and in-gel digested with trypsin, followed by peptide N-terminal derivatization with phenyl isocyanate (PIC) (PMID: 34315505). Peptide mixtures were separated by reversed-phase chromatography on an EASY-Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 25-cm long (inner diameter 75 µm, PepMap C18, 2 µm particles), which was connected online to a Q Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through an EASY-Spray™ Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described (PMID: 34315505).

### Data Protocol
The acquired RAW data were analyzed using EpiProfile 2.0 (PMID: 29790754)
