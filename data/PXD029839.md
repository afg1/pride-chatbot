### Title
Cultured cell LC-MS Analysis to check PTM

### Description
To figure out relation between KRAS and AIMP2-DX2(an exon 2-deleted splice variant of AIMP2 (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 2) based on its stability

### Sample Protocol
Target protein transfected cell was harvested and run electrophoresis. Using gel digestion method, sample was trypsinized and collected. Collected sample has cleaned with C18 spin column. with speedvac, buffer has dried and resuspend with 0.1%FA

### Data Protocol
With LTQ-Orbitrap velos, raw file has maden. To analyze peak, Proteome discoverer program has used. To lerance for Fragment mass was 0.8Da and for precursor is 25ppm. Oxidation(M) and GG(K) was dynamic modification and for static modification carbamidomethylation(c) has set
