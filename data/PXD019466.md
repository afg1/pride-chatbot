### Title
HLA-DQ8 Immunopeptidomics, Type 1 Diabetes

### Description
In this project we will investigate the peptides present by HLA-DQ8. We will identify linear, spliced and PTM peptides from one cell line.

### Sample Protocol
BLCL cells expressing different HLAs were lysed. Following lysis, peptide-HLA complexes were affinity purified by anti-HLA- antibody. Affinity purified HLA molecules and their peptide cargo were separated using reversed-phase chromatography and peptides were subsequently analysed using mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was searched using PEAKS Studion  using following parameters: database: Human proteins from UniProt/SwissProt ,Oxidation of methionine  no enzyme digestion (considers all peptide bond cleavages). For spliced peptide identifictication we use Hybrid Finder algorithm.
