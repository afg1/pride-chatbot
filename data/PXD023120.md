### Title
ProteomeTools Part V - TMT labeled non-modified non-tryptic peptides

### Description
The ProteomeTools project aims to derive molecular and digital tools from the human proteome to facilitate biomedical and life science research. Here, we describe the the generation and multimodal LC-MS/MS analysis of >300,000 synthetic non-tryptic peptides labeled with tandem mass tags (TMT6plex).

### Sample Protocol
Tryptic peptides were individually synthesized by solid phase synthesis, combined into pools of ~1,000 peptides and derivatized with TMT6plex reagent (equal amount per TMT channel). The data was aquired on an Oribtrap Fusion ETD mass spectrometer. For each peptide pool, an inclusion list was generated based on the expected modified peptide masses to target peptides for fragmentation using five fragmentation methods (HCD, CID) with ion trap or Orbitrap readout and HCD spectra were recorded at 6 different collision energies.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS runs were individually anaysed using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30 and searched against a protein consisting out of concatenated peptide sequences. TMT6plex was searched as varaible modification to obtain data on both the unmodified retention time standards and the derivatized TMT-labeled peptides
