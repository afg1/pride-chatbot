### Title
AKT2 interacting proteins_ MBP- and MAP-TAPs

### Description
Tagged AKT2 was expressed in HEK293T cells. For quantification SILAC labeling was performed. MBP-TAP: Cell lysates were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with unlabeled wild type cells before Tandem Affinity Purification. MAP-TAP: Same amount of labeled and unlabeled cell lysates were purified via Tandem Affinity Purification and afterwards eluates were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. AKT2 and co-purified proteins were digested with trypsin, fractionated via SCX and analyzed via LC-MS. Sequence database-search of the MS data was performed against the uniprot human taxonomy-9606 database containing 83659 entries using the SEQUEST algorithm with the following parameters: trypsin specificity, two missed cleavage sites, precurser ion mass accuracy tolerance of 10–30 ppm, cysteine carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, pSTY, N-terminal protein acetylation and, when performed, SILAC labels Lys-6, Arg-6 specified as modifications. The minimal cross-correlation score (XCorr) was set to 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 for charge states +2, +3 and +4 respectively. The Delta Cn had to be >0.1 and the minimal peptide probability allowed was 0.05. The minimum number of peptides necessary for protein identification was three.

### Publication Abstract
AKT2 is one of the three isoforms of the protein kinase AKT being involved in the modulation of cellular metabolism. Since protein-protein interactions are one possibility to convey specificity in signal transduction, we performed AKT2-protein interaction analysis to elucidate their relevance for AKT2-dependent cellular functions. We identified heat shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90), Cdc37, heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70), 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78), tubulin, GAPDH, &#x3b1;-enolase and elongation factor 2 (EF2) as AKT2-interacting proteins by a combination of tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry in HEK293T cells. Quantitative MS-analysis using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) revealed that only HSP90 and Cdc37 interact stably with AKT2, whereas the other proteins interact with low affinity with AKT2. The interactions of AKT2 with &#x3b1;-enolase and EF2 were further analyzed in order to uncover the functional relevance of these newly discovered binding partners. Despite the interaction of AKT2 and &#x3b1;-enolase, which was additionally validated by proximity ligation assay (PLA), no significant impact of AKT on &#x3b1;-enolase activity was detected in activity measurements. AKT stimulation via insulin and/or inhibition with the ATP-competitive inhibitor CCT128930 did not alter enzymatic activity of &#x3b1;-enolase. Interestingly, the direct interaction of AKT2 and EF2 was found to be dynamically regulated in embryonic rat cardiomyocytes. Treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 before stimulation with several hormones stabilized the complex, whereas stimulation alone led to complex dissociation which was analyzed in situ with PLA. Taken together, these findings point to new aspects of AKT2-mediated signal transduction in protein synthesis and glucose metabolism.
