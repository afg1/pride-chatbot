### Title
Staphylococcus aureus membrane vesicles confer resistance to antimicrobial fatty acids

### Description
S. aureus is a common commensal inhabitant of skin and nares of healthy individuals. In these environments, S. aureus overcomes colonisation barriers deployed by the innate immune system, which include long chain unsaturated free fatty acids with known potent anti-staphylococcal activity. S. aureus resistance mechanisms to these antimicrobial fatty acids (AFAs) remain elusive. However, it is well-documented that AFAs target S. aureus membrane, and increase its fluidity. This is associated with a drastic change in secreted proteins. The most abundantly secreted proteins in response to AFAs were recently identified to be components of S. aureus membrane vesicles (MVs), as revealed by proteomics analyses. Here, we demonstrate that MVs are decoys that trap AFAs. Importantly, MV release and composition are modulated by AFAs to promote bacterial survival.

### Sample Protocol
S. aureus LAC USA300 was grown for 6 hours in TSB supplemented with 40 µM linoleic acid or DMSO. After centrifugation of the cultures, supernatants were sterile-filtered, transferred onto 100-kDa centrifugal concentrator cartridges, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g and enriched with 100-kDa centrifugal concentrator cartridges. The > 100 kDa fractions were incubated overnight at 4°C with ExoQuick-TC for membrane vesicle purification. The next day, the pelleted vesicles were resuspended in a buffer containing 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% N-Octylglucoside. After precipitation and resolving the proteins in 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, protein amounts were determined with Bradford assay. 20 µg per sample were purified by SDS PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin. Extracted and desalted peptides were separated on an Easy nLC 1200 system coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer using an 87 minute segmented gradient of 10–33-50-90% of HPLC solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). The 7 most intense precursor ions were sequentially fragmented in each scan cycle using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. In all measurements, sequenced precursor masses were excluded from further selection for 30 s. The target values for MS/MS fragmentation were 105 charges and 3x106 charges for the MS scan.

### Data Protocol
Spectra were processed with MaxQuant software package version 1.6.7.0 with integrated Andromeda search engine. Database search was performed against a target-decoy Staphylococcus aureus database obtained from Uniprot consisting of 2,607 protein entries and 286 commonly observed contaminants. In database search, full specificity was required for trypsin. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Initial precursor mass tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and to 20 ppm at the MS/MS level. Peptide, protein and modification site identifications were reported at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, estimated by the target/decoy approach. The iBAQ (Intensity Based Absolute Quantification) and LFQ (Label-Free Quantification) algorithms were enabled, as was the “match between runs” option.

### Publication Abstract
<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a major pathogen, which colonizes one in three otherwise healthy humans. This significant spread of <i>S. aureus</i> is largely due to its ability to circumvent innate immune responses, including antimicrobial fatty acids (AFAs) on the skin and in nasal secretions. In response to AFAs, <i>S. aureus</i> swiftly induces resistance mechanisms, which have yet to be completely elucidated. Here, we identify membrane vesicle (MV) release as a resistance strategy used by <i>S. aureus</i> to sequester host-specific AFAs. MVs protect <i>S. aureus</i> against a wide array of AFAs. Strikingly, beside MV production, <i>S. aureus</i> modulates MV composition upon exposure to AFAs. MVs purified from bacteria grown in the presence of linoleic acid display a distinct protein content and are enriched in lipoproteins, which strongly activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Cumulatively, our findings reveal the protective capacities of MVs against AFAs, which are counteracted by an increased TLR2-mediated innate immune response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The nares of one in three humans are colonized by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> In these environments, and arguably on all mucosal surfaces, bacteria encounter fatty acids with antimicrobial properties. Our study uncovers that <i>S. aureus</i> releases membrane vesicles (MVs) that act as decoys to protect the bacterium against antimicrobial fatty acids (AFAs). The AFA-neutralizing effects of MVs were neither strain specific nor restricted to one particular AFA. Hence, MVs may represent "public goods" playing an overlooked role in shaping bacterial communities in AFA-rich environments such as the skin and nose. Intriguingly, in addition to MV biogenesis, <i>S. aureus</i> modulates MV composition in response to exposure to AFAs, including an increased release of lipoproteins. These MVs strongly stimulate the innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). TLR2-mediated inflammation, which helps to fight infections, may exacerbate inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis. Our study highlights intricate immune responses preventing infections from colonizing bacteria.
