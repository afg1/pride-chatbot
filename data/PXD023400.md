### Title
Mechanism of disaggregation of Tau fibrils in vivo

### Description
The interactome of fibrillar aggregates of the Tau repeat domain fused to YFP (TauRD-Y) was analyzed in HEK293T cells using SILAC. TauRD-Y was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody from lysates of SILAC-labeled cells expressing TauRD-Y in soluble form (light labeled; L), from cells containing aggregated TauRD-Y in nucleus and cytosol (medium labeled; M), and from cells containing aggregated TauRD-Y mainly localized to the cytoosl (heavy-labeled; H).

### Sample Protocol
Samples were processed according to the FASP method, peptides fractionated by SAX, desalted and analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo). Please see the publication of Saha et al. for detailed information.

### Data Protocol
Thermo raw files were processed using MaxQuant version 1.5.4.1. Please see the publication of Saha et al. for detailed information.
