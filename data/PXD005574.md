### Title
Metaproteomics on preterm infant stool

### Description
Development of the gut microbiota is greatly impacted in preterm infants. Despite increasing knowledge about microbiota composition in preterm infants, knowledge about the functional signatures of the intestinal microbiota remains limited. The aim was to study transitions in microbiota activity during the first six postnatal weeks in ten preterm infants. A total of 64 stool samples were measured by LC-MS/MS.

### Sample Protocol
0.125 g of meconium or faeces was suspended in 375 μl PBS and cells were lysed by five times bead beating. Protein extracts were diluted in PBS to 3 μg/μl and 100 μg of each sample was loaded on precast 10% acrylamide gels. After short electrophoresis (10min), the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteins were reduced, and carbamidomethylated and each sample was cut and digested with trypsin. Peptides were measured by nLC – LTQ-OrbitrapXL MSMS.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (1.5.2.8) with Andromeda search engine was used for identification and relative quantitation.
