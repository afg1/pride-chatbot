### Title
Yeast Nat Nt-acetylation SWATH MS

### Description
Yeast strains (wild type, Naa10 KO and Naa20 KO, resp: wt, natA-delta and natB-delta) were profiled for full proteome analysis by SWATH MS

### Sample Protocol
Yeast strains (wild type, Naa10 KO and Naa20 KO, resp: wt, natA-delta and natB-delta) were cultured; cells were quenched with TCA and washed with acetone. Cells were lyzed by beads-beating in urea, reduced with TCEP, alkylated with IAA and digested with trypsin. Peptides were cleaned-up on C18 cartridges and measured by LC-MS on Eksigent nanoLC coupled to a tripleTOF 5600 operating in DDA (spectral library generation) or SWATH/DIA mode (64 variable windows)

### Data Protocol
DDA files were searched with Mascot+Comet. The search results were combined with iProphet and filtered at 1% PSM FDR. The spectral library was generated with spectraST and exported to an assay list format. The DIA/SWATH data were extracted with openSWATH using the exported assay list; the openSWATH results were further re-aligned using TRIC; the TRIC output was processed with mapDIA for fragment and peptide selection and for the statistical analysis
