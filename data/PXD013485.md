### Title
Effect of lung ventilation and acid treatment on mouse lung proteome

### Description
Lung tissue samples were collected from mice allowed to breath freely (FB) or on ventilation (LV) devices, either saline or acid treatment (four sample groups FB_saline; FB_acid; LV_saline; LV_acid)

### Sample Protocol
Tissue samples were extracted in TPER reagent, proteins quantified by Q-bit assay and 50ug protein digested using trypsin/rLysC after SP3 clean-up. Approximately 400ng of each sample was analysed using a U3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive HF.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS2 data for the complete set of 288 samples was processed in the MaxQuant environment, using the mouse proteome reference database
