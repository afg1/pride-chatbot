### Title
Amyloids induce glycocalyx mediated mechanotransduction

### Description
Pulldown PMEL NINTA; secretome BXPC3 DMSO vs BACE2 inhibitor (3I), insoluble fractione of secretome in IGR37; insoluble fractione of secretome in BXPC3

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation was performed by using Amicon®Ultra centrifugal filters with 10 kDa cutoff (Millipore) changing PBS with 8 M Urea and 100 mM Tris, pH 8, then cysteine reduction and alkylation was performed by adding 10 mM TCEP (Thermo scientific) and 40 mM 2-Chloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 8 M Urea and 100 mM Tris, pH 8, for 30 minutes at room temperature. The buffer was exchanged by centrifugation at 9,300 g for 10 minutes. The samples were then washed twice with 8 M Urea and 100 mM Tris, pH 8.  proteins in solution were digested with trypsin (Trypsin, Sequencing Grade, modified from ROCHE) (1:50 = enzyme: secreted proteins) overnight at 37°C.

### Data Protocol
Protein quantitation was performed with MaxQuant, statistical analysis with Perseus software
