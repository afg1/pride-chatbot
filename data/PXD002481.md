### Title
Pig embryonic muscle iTRAQ analysis

### Description
Here, we performed the first iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle from Landrance (LR) and miniature pig (Wuzhishan WZS) ranging from 21 to 42 days post coitus (dpc). 4431 proteins were identified. In both WZS and LR, the largest amount of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between 28 and 35 dpc. 252 breed-DEPs were selected by GO analysis, including 8 myofibrillar proteins. Only MYHCⅠ/IIA mRNA were detected due to early embryonic stages, and significantly higher expression of them were found in WZS during these 4 stages. MYHCⅠ was first found in WZS at 28 dpc and expressed in both breeds at later stages, while MYHCII protein was not detected until 35 dpc in both breeds. Thus, 33 myogenic breed-DEPs selected from last two stages were analyzed by STRING, which showed that some myofibrillar proteins (MYH1, TPM4, MYH10, et.al) and functional proteins (CSRP2, CASQ2, OTC, et.al), together with candidate myogenic proteins (H3F3A, HDGFRP2, et.al), probably participate in the regulatory network of myofiber formation. Thus, our study provides new data on myofiber type development during early embryo stages, which contributes to the improved understanding in the regulation mechanism of early myogenesis in agricultural animals.

### Sample Protocol
For protein analyzing, tissues were processed as described before[23]. 100 μg protein for each sample was digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega, USA) at a protein: trypsin ratio of 20:1 at 37°C for 4 hours. Then peptides were dried via vacuum centrifugation. The samples were labeled with 113 (LR 21 dpc), 114 (LR 28 dpc), 115 (LR 35 dpc), 116 (LR 42 dpc), 117 (WZS 21 dpc), 118 (WZS 28 dpc), 119 (WZS 35 dpc) and 121 (WZS 42 dpc) iTRAQ reagent, respectively, by incubation at room temperature for 2 hours. To reduce sample complexity, strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, using an off-line SCX cartridge and buffers supplied by ABI, was carried out for cell lysate-derived peptides.

### Data Protocol
The peptides were subjected to nanoelectrosprayionization followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in a LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher, USA) coupled online to the HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and processed as described before[24]. For MS scans, the m/z scan range was 350 to 2000 Da. The experiment was repeated three times, and the results were categorized as 113-121 groups.  The MS/MS data were searched against the Ensembl: Sus_scrofa.Sscrofa1 0.2.69.pep.all.fa (25152 sequences) database for peptide identification and quantification using the Mascot 2.3.02. We set the parameters as follows: trypsin as enzyme, methylmethanethio sulphonate of cysteines residues as fixed modification. The Paragon Algorithm (Applied Biosystem) followed by the ProGroup Algorithm (Applied Biosystem) were applied to remove redundant hits to determine the target proteins. Other parameters: fragment ion accuracy, tryptic cleavage specificity, and allowance for number of missed cleavages et.al were processed by ProteinPilot software. We considered Unused Prot-Score>1.3 as threshold with at least more than one peptide above the 95% confidence as benchmark for protein identification.
