### Title
Proteomics insights into Frankia alni molecular dialogue with its host

### Description
Next-generation proteomics of Frankia alni for defining the key proteins involved in the molecular dialogue with its plant host.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
