### Title
Label-free quantitative proteomics for mouse kidney tissue of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) vs Sham.

### Description
Label-free quantitative proteomics for mouse kidney tissue of UUO vs Sham was used for discovery of differential expressed proteins in the process of renal fibrosis. Compared to sham mice, we found that 216 upregulated proteins and 215 downregulated proteins in UUO mice according to fold change ≥ 5, adjusted-p ≤ 0.01. Then, we will study the potential mechanism according to differential expressed proteins.

### Sample Protocol
Each mouse kidney tissue was ground into powder in nitrogen, then lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4% SDS, 0.1 M DTT) was added, and the mixture was sonicated with 20 cycles of pulses (30 s each on/off, 80% power; CosmoSonic II Ultra Sonicator). After heating for 10 min at 95 oC, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min at room temperature. The protein concentrations were determined by measuring tryptophan fluorescence. 100 μg protein was digested by the FASP method as previously described.63 Each sample peptides was loaded onto a 20-cm column packed in-house with C18 3 μM ReproSil particles (Dr. Maisch GmbH), with an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Colmn temperature was maintained at 50 oC. Peptides were separated with a 120 min gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Each sample was detected twice.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were processed using software MaxQuant (http://www.maxquant.org.) version 1.6.2.10 with an FDR < 0.01 at the levels of proteins and peptides. The MS/MS spectra were searched against the Homo sapiens protein database in UniProt (January 2021). Bioinformatics analyses were carried out with R (https://www.r-project.org/) statistical computing software.
