### Title
Complex formation of APP with GABAB receptors links axonal trafficking to amyloidogenic processing

### Description
GABAB receptors (GBRs) are key regulators of synaptic release but little is known about trafficking mechanisms that control their presynaptic abundance. We now show that sequence-related epitopes in APP, AJAP-1 and PIANP bind with nanomolar affinities to the N-terminal sushi-domain of presynaptic GBRs. Of the three interacting proteins, selectively the genetic loss of APP impaired GBR-mediated presynaptic inhibition and axonal GBR expression. Proteomic and functional analyses revealed that APP associates with JIP and calsyntenin proteins that link the APP/GBR complex in cargo vesicles to the axonal trafficking motor. Complex formation with GBRs stabilizes APP at the cell surface and reduces proteolysis of APP to Aβ, a component of senile plaques in Alzheimer’s disease patients. Thus, APP/GBR complex formation links presynaptic GBR trafficking to Aβ formation. Our findings support that dysfunctional axonal trafficking and reduced GBR expression in Alzheimer’s disease increases Aβ formation.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes were affinity purified from solubilized brain membranes, denatured and shortly run on SDS-PAGE gels and silver-stained. Lanes were cut into two sections (high and low MW) and digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Peptides were extracted, dissolved in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a trap column (C18 PepMap100, 5 µm particles; Thermo Scientific) with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (20 µl/min for 5 min), separated by reversed phase chromatography via a 10 cm C18 column (PicoTip™ Emitter, 75 µm, tip: 8 µm, New Objective, self-packed with ReproSil-Pur 120 ODS-3, 3 µm, Dr. Maisch HPLC; flow rate 300 nl/min) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Scientific), and eluted by an aqueous organic gradient (eluent “A”: 0.5% acetic acid; eluent “B” 0.5% acetic acid in 80% acetonitrile; “A”/”B” gradient: 5 min 3% B, 60 min from 3% B to 30% B, 15 min from 30% B to 99% B, 5 min 99% B, 5 min from 99% B to 3% B, 15 min 3% B). Sensitive and high-resolution MS-analyses were done on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (both Thermo Scientific). Precursor signals (LC-MS) were acquired with a target value of 1,000,000 and a nominal resolution of 240,000 (FWHM) at m/z 400; scan range 370 to 1700 m/z). Up to ten data-dependent CID fragment ion spectra (isolation width 1.0 m/z with wideband activation) per scan cycle were allowed in the ion trap with a target value of 10,000 (maximum injection time 200 ms for complex) with dynamic exclusion (exclusion duration 30 s; exclusion mass width ± 20 ppm), preview mode for FTMS master scans, charge state screening, monoisotopic precursor selection and charge state rejection (unassigned charge states and for trypsin-digested samples also charge state 1) enabled.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data were extracted using “msconvert.exe” (part of ProteoWizard; http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/, version 3.0.6906). Peak lists were searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (release 2016 or newer; containing all rat, mouse and human entries) using Mascot 2.6.0 (Matrix Science, UK). Initially preliminary searches with high peptide mass tolerance (± 50 ppm) were performed. After linear shift mass recalibration using in-house developed software, tolerance was reduced to ± 5 ppm for final searches. Fragment mass tolerance was set to ± 0.8 Da (ion trap MS/MS spectra). One missed trypsin cleavage and common variable modifications including S/T/Y phosphorylation were accepted for peptide identification. Significance threshold was set to p < 0.05. Proteins identified by only one specific MS/MS spectrum or representing exogenous contaminations such as keratins or immunoglobulins were eliminated. Label-free quantification of proteins was based on peak volumes (PVs = peptide m/z signal intensities integrated over time) of peptide features as described previously. Peptide feature extraction was done with MaxQuant (http://www.maxquant.org/, version 1.4) with integrated effective mass calibration. Features were then aligned between different LC-MS/MS runs and assigned to peptides with retention time tolerance ± 1 min and mass tolerance: ± 1.5 ppm using an in-house developed software. The resulting peptide PV tables formed the basis for protein quantification, more details are shown in the method section and in supplementary tables 1 and 2 of the related publication.

### Publication Abstract
GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GBRs) are key regulators of synaptic release but little is known about trafficking mechanisms that control their presynaptic abundance. We now show that sequence-related epitopes in APP, AJAP-1 and PIANP bind with nanomolar affinities to the N-terminal sushi-domain of presynaptic GBRs. Of the three interacting proteins, selectively the genetic loss of APP impaired GBR-mediated presynaptic inhibition and axonal GBR expression. Proteomic and functional analyses revealed that APP associates with JIP and calsyntenin proteins that link the APP/GBR complex in cargo vesicles to the axonal trafficking motor. Complex formation with GBRs stabilizes APP at the cell surface and reduces proteolysis of APP to A&#x3b2;, a component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease patients. Thus, APP/GBR complex formation links presynaptic GBR trafficking to A&#x3b2; formation. Our findings support that dysfunctional axonal trafficking and reduced GBR expression in Alzheimer's disease increases A&#x3b2; formation.
