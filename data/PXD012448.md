### Title
The Human Gut Firmicute Roseburia intestinalis is a Primary Degrader of Dietary β-Mannans

### Description
β-Mannans are plant cell wall polysaccharides that are commonly found in human diets. However, a mechanistic understanding into the key populations that degrade this glycan is absent, especially for the dominant Firmicutes phylum. Here, we show that the prominent butyrate-producing Firmicute Roseburia intestinalis expresses two loci conferring metabolism of β-mannans. We combine multi-“omic” analyses and detailed biochemical studies to comprehensively characterize loci-encoded proteins that are involved in β-mannan capturing, importation, de-branching and degradation into monosaccharides. In mixed cultures, R. intestinalis shares the available β-mannan with Bacteroides ovatus, demonstrating that the apparatus allows coexistence in a competitive environment. In murine experiments, β-mannan selectively promotes beneficial gut bacteria, exemplified by increased R. intestinalis, and reduction of mucus-degraders. Our findings highlight that R. intestinalis is a primary degrader of this dietary fiber and that this metabolic capacity could be exploited to selectively promote key members of the healthy microbiota using β-mannan-based therapeutic interventions.

### Sample Protocol
R. intestinalis was grown in triplicate on YCFA supplemented with either 0.5 % (w/v) glucose or AcGGM, respectively, as a sole carbon source. Samples (10 ml) were harvested at the mid-exponential growth phase. Cell pellet was collected by centrifugation (4,500 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and disrupted by bead-beating using three 60s cycles with a FastPrep24 (MP Biomedicals, CA). Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA), final concentration of 10% (v/v), incubated on ice for 1 h, centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) to pellet the precipitated proteins and washed with 300 μL ice-cold 0.01 M HCl in 90% acetone. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with a 10% Mini-PROTEAN gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA) and then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250. The gel was cut into five slices, after which proteins were reduced, alkylated, and in-gel digested according to a method published previously. The peptides were dried under vacuum, solubilized in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted using C18 ZipTips (Merck Millipore, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The peptide mixture from each fraction was analyzed using a nanoHPLC-MS/MS system as described previously, using a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. Mass spectral data were acquired using Xcalibur (v.2.2 SP1).

### Data Protocol
MS raw files were processed with the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.4.1.2) for identification and label-free quantification (LFQ) of proteins. Proteins were identified by searching MS and MS/MS data of peptides against the UniProtKB complete proteome of R. intestinalis L1-82 (4,698 sequences) supplemented with common contaminants (e.g. keratins, trypsin, and bovine serum albumin). In addition, reversed sequences of all protein entries were concatenated to the database for estimation of false-discovery rates (FDRs). Trypsin was set as proteolytic enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Protein N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionines, deamidation of asparagines and glutamines and formation of pyro-glutamic acid at N-terminal glutamines were defined as variable modifications while carbamidomethylation of cysteines was used as a fixed modification. The “match between runs” feature of MaxQuant, which enables identification transfer only between samples from the same carbon source based on accurate mass and retention time, was applied with default parameters. All identifications were filtered in order to achieve a protein false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. A protein was considered “present” if it was detected in at least two of the three biological replicates in at least one glycan substrate. Missing values were imputed from a normal distribution (width of 0.3 and down shifted 1.8 standard deviations from the original distribution) in total matrix mode and differential abundance analysis was performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test with a permutation-based FDR set to 0.05. Hierarchical clustering and heat map representations were generated using Euclidean distance measure and average linkage using Perseus (version 1.5.5.3).
