### Title
In-depth proteomic analysis of nasal fluids from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps by data-independent acqusition

### Description
Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, the effects of antibiotics on the microbiome and secreted proteome remain unknown in regard to CRS.We analyzed the effects of antibiotics on the nasal secreted proteome inthe context of CRS using data-independent acqusition proteomics approach.

### Sample Protocol
Nasal secretions were collected from 29 control, 30 CRS patients without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and 40 CRS patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). A total of 99 subjects were divided into two groups that included subjects who had taken antibiotics 3 months prior to sampling (ABX) and those who had not (NABX). Proteins that extracted from nasal fluids were digested by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol. Digested peptides were desalted by C18-stageTip.

### Data Protocol
We performed Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses in data-independent acquisition (DIA) on the nasal secretions. MS raw files were processed using Spectronaut Pulsar X.
