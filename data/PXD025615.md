### Title
Quantitative proteomics identifies Ola1p as a positive regulator of heat shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

### Description
Ola1 is implicated in various stress response pathways, as well as in cancer and tumor progression. However, Ola1p functions are divergent between species and still remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of Ola1p in the heat shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that deletion of OLA1 results in higher levels of proteins with protective functions for proteome stability under heat stress. We found that Ola1p enriches in detergent-resistant protein aggregates during heat stress. In heat-stressed yeast cells, it rapidly forms assemblies that localize to stress granules. In vitro, Ola1p assembly is protein autonomous and coincides with structural rearrangements that occur at similar temperatures and pH values seen in cells. We further observed that deletion of OLA1 leads to increased ubiquitination of protein aggregates formed during heat stress. Upon stress relief, central factors for protein refolding and the clearance of protein aggregates are synthesized in higher amounts in dola1 cells, whereas global translation reinitiation is decreased in these cells. Our data suggest that Ola1p is a positive factor for stabilizing the misfolded proteome that is sequestered in cytoplasmic stress granules during heat stress and, thereby, enables cells to efficiently restore a functional proteome after stress relief.

### Sample Protocol
In pulsed SILAC experiments, cells were grown in ‘light’ SC medium containing Arg0/Lys0 and subjected to heat stress at 42°C for 30 min. Afterwards, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2 min at 1,600 x g) and resuspended in either ‘medium-heavy’ or ‘heavy’ SC medium containing Arg6/Lys4 and Arg10/Lys8, respectively. Samples were taken 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after heat stress and cells were mixed in equal amounts based on cell numbers. 10 µg of protein were used for proteolytic in-solution digestion. Cysteine residues were reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin, alkylated with iodoacetamid, and proteins were digested using LysC and trypsin as previously described (Dannenmaier et al., 2018, Anal. Chem. 90). Peptides were desalted using StageTips as described before with minor modifications (Rappsilber et al., 2003, Anal. Chem. 75). In brief, peptide mixtures were loaded onto StageTips conditioned with methanol, followed by 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN)/0.5% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid. Peptides were washed twice using 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid and eluted using 80% (v/v) ACN/0.5% (v/v) acetic acid. Solvents were evaporated and peptides were resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.   LC/MS analysis: Nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) online coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. The RSLC system was equipped with nanoEase™ M/Z Symmetry C18, 100Å, 5µm precolums (Waters; length: 20 mm; inner diameter: 180 µm; flow rate: 5-10 µl/min) and a nanoEase™ M/Z HSS C18 T3 Col analytical column (Waters; length: 250 mm; inner diameter: 75 µm; particle size: 1.8 µm; packing density: 100 Å; flow rate: 0.3 µl/min). Peptides were washed and concentrated on precolumns and separated on the analytical column using a binary solvent consisting of solvent A (0.1% [v/v] FA/4% [v/v] DMSO) and solvent B (0.1% [v/v] FA/4% [v/v] DMSO/48% [v/v] methanol/30% [v/v] ACN). Peptides were eluted using a gradient starting with 7% solvent B for 5 min, followed by 7-50% B in 245 min, 50-95% B in 85 min, and 5 min at 95% B.  The mass spectrometer was equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source with DirectJunction adaptor (Thermo Scientific) and distal coated fused silica Tips (FS360-20-10-D, New Objective). The instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Full MS scans were acquired in the orbitrap with the following parameters: mass range, m/z 370-1700; resolution, 120,000 at m/z 400; automatic gain control (AGC), 10E6 ions; maximum injection time, 200 ms. The 25 most intensive peptide ions (z ≥ 2) were selected for fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation in the linear ion trap. MS/MS scans were acquired with the following parameters: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation q, 0.25; activation time, 10 ms; AGC target value, 5,000; maximum injection time, 150 ms; isolation width, 2.0 m/z; dynamic exclusion time, 45 s.

### Data Protocol
MS data analysis: MaxQuant/Andromeda was used for protein identification and quantification (version 1.5.5.1) (Cox and Mann, 2008, Nat. Biotechnol. 26; Cox et al., 2011, J. Proteome Res. 4). MS/MS data were searched against a yeast-specific database obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/) and a list of common contaminants included in the MaxQuant software package. Database searches were carried out using trypsin and LysC specificity, a maximum number of two missed cleavages, and a mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for precursor and 20 ppm for fragment ions. Oxidation of methionine and acetylation of protein N-termini were considered as variable and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues as fixed modification. Multiplicity was set to three, and Arg10/Lys8 were set as ‘heavy’, Arg6/Lys4 as ‘medium-heavy’ and Arg0/Lys0 as ‘light’ label. The options ‘re-quantify’ and ‘match between runs’ were enabled. Protein identification was based on peptides with a minimum length of seven amino acids and at least one unique peptide. The false discovery rate for peptide and protein identification was 0.01.  Non-normalized H/M ratios were used to assess differences in global protein synthesis between wildtype and dola1 cells. To correct for inequalities in sample mixing, the correction factor λ was determined based on iBAQ intensities of the different populations using the following equation: λ = (Σ iBAQ intensities) dola1/(Σ iBAQ intensities) wt as described before (Fierro-Monti et al., 2013, PLoS ONE 8).

### Publication Abstract
The universally conserved P-loop ATPase Ola1 is implicated in various cellular stress response pathways, as well as in cancer and tumor progression. However, Ola1p functions are divergent between species, and the involved mechanisms are only poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of Ola1p in the heat shock response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of quantitative and pulse labeling-based proteomics approaches, in&#xa0;vitro studies, and cell-based assays. Our data show that when heat stress is applied to cells lacking Ola1p, the expression of stress-protective proteins is enhanced. During heat stress Ola1p associates with detergent-resistant protein aggregates and rapidly forms assemblies that localize to stress granules. The assembly of Ola1p was also observed in&#xa0;vitro using purified protein and conditions, which resembled those in living cells. We show that loss of Ola1p results in increased protein ubiquitination of detergent-insoluble aggregates recovered from heat-shocked cells. When cells lacking Ola1p were subsequently relieved from heat stress, reinitiation of translation was delayed, whereas, at the same time, de novo synthesis of central factors required for protein refolding and the clearance of aggregates was enhanced when compared with wild-type cells. The combined data suggest that upon acute heat stress, Ola1p is involved in the stabilization of misfolded proteins, which become sequestered in cytoplasmic stress granules. This function of Ola1p enables cells to resume translation in a timely manner as soon as heat stress is relieved.
