### Title
Chemoproteomics-Enabled Discovery of a Covalent Molecular Glue Degrader

### Description
Discovery of a covalent molecular glue degrader that covalently interacts with UBE2D and engages in molecular glue interactions with NFKB1

### Sample Protocol
Sample protocols include isoTOP-ABPP for cysteine chemoproteomic profiling, and 6-plex TMT-based quantitative proteomic profiling

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using PROLUCID and Integrated Proteomics (IP2)
