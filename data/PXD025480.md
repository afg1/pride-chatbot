### Title
Cerebral tissue of the animal model data LC-MS/MS

### Description
Label-free quantitative proteomic technology was engaged to study protein expression levels of Post-stroke depression(PSD) rat models' brain tissue.

### Sample Protocol
Cerebral tissue of the animal model was incubation in lysis buffer for 2 hours at 4 â„ƒ, which containing NaCl 150 mmol/L, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 1% Nonidet P-40. Then the sample was lysed by ultrasound for 3 cycles of 30 seconds and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and treated with 10mM of DTT for 30 minutes followed by 5mM iodacetamide for 30 minutes. After that, the protein sample was digested with trypsin overnight.

### Data Protocol
Protein quantitation was analyzed using MaxQuant software. For the searches, oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N-term) were set as the variable modifications. Two missed cleavage were allowed. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/), UniProt Database (https://www.uniprot.org/), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG Resources (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/conversion.jsp).
