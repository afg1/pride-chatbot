### Title
B12-ABP labeling of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

### Description
Proteomic data from B. theta probed with B12-ABP; treated with B12-ABP or CNB12

### Sample Protocol
Click chemistry was performed using biotin-azide or a control without biotin, followed by streptavidin enrichment, trypsin digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis; 4 biological replicates.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MaxQuant, which identified and quantified peptides and proteins across all of the datasets
