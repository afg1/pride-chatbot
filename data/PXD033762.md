### Title
Mebendazole Inhibits Histoplasma capsulatum In Vitro Growth and Decreases Mitochondrion and Cytoskeleton Protein Levels 

### Description
Histoplasmosis is a frequent mycosis in people living with HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromised hosts. Histoplasmosis has high rates of mortality in these patients if treatment is unsuccessful. Itraconazole and amphotericin B are used to treat histoplasmosis; however, both antifungals have potentially severe pharmacokinetic drug interactions and toxicity. The present study determined the minimal inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations of mebendazole, a drug present in the NIH Clinical Collection, to establish whether it has fungicidal or fungistatic activity against Histoplasma capsulatum. Protein extracts from H. capsulatum yeasts, treated or not with mebendazole, were analyzed by proteomics to understand the metabolic changes driven by this benzimidazole. Mebendazole inhibited the growth of 10 H. capsulatum strains, presenting minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 5.0 to 0.08 µM. Proteomics revealed 30 and 18 proteins exclusively detected in untreated and mebendazole-treated H. capsulatum yeast cells, respectively. Proteins related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, cytoskeleton, and ribosomes were highly abundant in untreated cells. Proteins related to the nitrogen, sulfur, and pyrimidine metabolisms were enriched in mebendazole-treated cells. Furthermore, mebendazole was able to inhibit the oxidative metabolism, disrupt the cytoskeleton, and decrease ribosomal proteins in H. capsulatum. These results suggest mebendazole as a drug to be repurposed for histoplasmosis treatment.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction - Histoplasma capsulatum G217B (ATCC 26032) was used at this stage of the study. To obtain the protein extracts, H. capsulatum yeasts and yeasts treated with mebendazole were cultivated into Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with cystine (8.4 mg/L), HEPES (6 g/L), glutamic acid (1 g/L), and glucose (18.2 g/L), pH 7.5. An initial density of 1 × 10E7 cells/mL were maintained at 36 °C for 72 h in a rotatory incubator at 150 rpm. After the incubation time, extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 2 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini®, Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) and zirconia beads of 0.5 mm diameter (BiospecProducts, Bartlesville, OK, USA), were added to the yeast cells. A vigorous agitation of this mixture was performed on a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec products) for five cycles of 30 s, separated by 1 min ice bath incubations. After this procedure, the material was centrifuged (10,000 xg) for 15 min at 4 °C and the Bradford method was employed to determine protein content, using bovine serum albumin  for the generation of standard curves. The protein profiles of the fungal extracts were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).   Sample Processing for Shotgun Proteomics - For each sample, the volume equivalent to 100 μg was dried on a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then submitted to trypsin digestion. Samples were initially suspended in 20 μL of 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate, 8 M urea, followed by the addition of 5 μL of 0.1 M dithiothreitol and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, 5 μL of 0.4 M iodoacetamide were added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were diluted by the addition of 130 μL of Milli-Q water followed by trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) addition at 1/50 (m/m) of enzyme to substrate and sequential incubation for 16 h at 37 °C and 45 min at 56 °C; the reaction was stopped with 20 μL of 10% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were desalted with in-lab generated columns packed with Poros R2 resin (Life Technologies). Columns were initially activated with 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN), followed by equilibration with 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Samples were applied to the columns and subjected to five washes with 0.1% TFA solution. The elution was carried out with four washes of 0.1% TFA in 70% CH3CN. Samples were dried on a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac) and stored at −20 °C until use. Prior to mass spectrometry (MS), each sample was suspended in 20 μL of 1% formic acid, and its peptide concentration was estimated by absorbance measurement at 280 nm (1.0 absorbance unit ≅ 1.0 μg/μL) on a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific); all samples were normalized to 0.5 μg/μL.  Mass Spectrometry Analysis - The desalted tryptic digests from five biological replicates from eitheir mebendazole-treated or -untreated Histoplasma capsulatum strain were each analyzed in two technical replicates by reversed-phase nano-chromatography coupled to high-resolution nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Chromatography was performed using a Easy-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Samples (2 µL per run) were initially applied, at 2 μL/min of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, to a 2-cm-long Thermo Acclaim trap column (3 um beads; part number 164535). Next, peptides were submitted to chromatographic separation on a 38-cm-long column (75 μm inner diameter), packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 120 Å 1.9 μm matrix (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) directly onto a self-pack 10 um PicroFrit empty column (New Objective, USA). Fractionation was performed at 200 nL/min having 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 80% acetonitrile in water as mobile phases A and B, respectively. Elution was carried out from 2% to 30% B in 120 min; up to 45% B in 40 min; up to 100% B in 4 min and maintained for 10 min more. The eluted peptides were introduced directly into a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap instrument. Ionization was achieved by applying 1.9 kV to the source, setting the capillary temperature to 250 °C, and alternate current (radiofrequency) level of the S-lenses at 60 V. The complete MS1 scans (300 to 1500 m/z) were acquired in the profile mode with one micro-scan at 70,000 resolution and an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1 × 10E6 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. The 12 most intense precursor ions within both isolation window and offset of 2.0 and 0.5 m/z, respectively, were selected for HCD (higher energy collision dissociation) fragmentation with a collision energy normalized to 30 units. The MS2 spectra (200 to 2000 m/z) were acquired in centroid mode with one micro-scan at 17,500 resolution and an AGC target value of 5×10E4 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s, whereas peaks with unassigned charge or those with z = 1 were rejected.

### Data Protocol
Protein Identification and Quantitation Following Mass Spectrometry - Data were analyzed using the PatternLab for Proteomics V pipeline (http://www.patternlabforproteomics.org/). An NCBInr Histoplasma capsulatum database  was downloaded on December 02, 2021 (95,405 entries). The “Generate Search Database” tool was used to remove (subset) sequences with 100% sequence identity (38,144 entries removed) and add common contaminants and decoy (reverse) sequences for all entries, to a final database size of 114,768 entries. MS data from each run were searched against this database using the Comet search tool, which is integrated into PatternLab. The parameters were set as follows: precursor mass error tolerance of 35 ppm, trypsin as the enzyme, semi-tryptic cleavage, maximum number of cleavage loss of 2. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification, while deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, carbamidomethylation of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, and lysine, and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Settings for fragment bin tolerance, fragment bin offset, and theoretical fragment ions were 0.02, 0, and "use flanking peaks", respectively. Spectral validation was performed using SEPro algorithm (Search Engine Processor); false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated from the number of decoy sequences identified, so that a maximum limit of 1% FDR, at peptide and protein levels, was established and only identifications with a mass error tolerance of 10 ppm were accepted. Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC)  was used for the quantitative comparisons between the two experimental groups the TFold module of PatternLab for Proteomics; normalization was done by total ion count. Only proteins that were detected in at least three (out of five) biological replicates, for each condition, and displayed at least 2 unique peptides, were submitted to relative quantitation with cut-off values for Benjamini–Hochberg q-value, F-stringency, and L-stringency of 0.05, 0.04, and 0.00, respectively; proteins that satisfied both the fold-change and statistical (p-value) criteria were further submitted to protein interaction and metabolic pathway analyses.
