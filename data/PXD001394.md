### Title
Global and specific responses of the histone acetylome to systematic perturbation

### Description
Regulation of histone acetylation is fundamental to the utilisation of eukaryotic genomes in chromatin. Aberrant acetylation contributes to disease and can be clinically combated by inhibiting the responsible enzymes. Our knowledge of the histone acetylation system is patchy because we so far lacked the methodology to describe acetylation patterns and their genesis by integrated enzyme activities. We devised a generally applicable, mass spectrometry-based strategy to precisely and accurately quantify combinatorial modification motifs. This was applied to generate a comprehensive inventory of acetylation motifs on histones H3 and H4 in Drosophila cells. Systematic depletion of known or suspected acetyltransferases and deacetylases revealed specific alterations of histone acetylation signatures, established enzyme-substrate relationships and unveiled an extensive crosstalk between neighboring modifications. Unexpectedly, overall histone acetylation levels remained remarkably constant upon depletion of individual acetyltransferases. Conceivably, the acetylation level is adjusted to maintain the global charge neutralisation of chromatin and the stability of nuclei.

### Sample Protocol
Histones from Drosophila cells were acid extracted and precipitated with TCA. After cold acetone washes, histones were separated by SDS-PAGE and bands corresponding to histones H3 and H4 were excised from the gels. Gel pieces containing histones were chemically acetylated with d6-deuterated acetic anhydride followed by overnight trypsin digestion at 37°C. Tryptic peptides were desalted using C18-StageTips eluted and reconstituted in 0.1% TFA. Peptides were separated with a gradient from 5-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 40 min at 300 nl/min on a C18 analytical nanocolumn. The effluent from the HPLC was directly electrosprayed into an LTQ-Orbitrap Classic mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS was operated in a targeted setup.

We devised a generally applicable, mass spectrometry-based strategy to precisely and accurately quantify combinatorial modification motifs. This was applied to generate a comprehensive inventory of acetylation motifs on histones H3 and H4 in Drosophila cells. Systematic depletion of known or suspected acetyltransferases and deacetylases revealed specific alterations of histone acetylation signatures, established enzyme-substrate relationships, and unveiled an extensive crosstalk between neighboring modifications. Unexpectedly, overall histone acetylation levels remained remarkably constant upon depletion of individual acetyltransferases.
