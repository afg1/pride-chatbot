### Title
Human cTnT fragmentation in serum

### Description
Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a highly cardiospecific protein commonly used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but is subject to proteolytic degradation upon its release in the circulation. In this study, a targeted mass spectrometry assay was developed to detect peptides which are differentially present within the different degradation products. cTnT was spiked in human serum and incubated at 37 °C to induce proteolytic degradation. Isolation and fractionation of cTnT and its fragments from serum were performed using immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Bands migrating to 37 kDa (intact cTnT), 29 kDa (primary fragment), and 19, 18, and 16 kDa (secondary fragments) were excised, digested, and subsequently analysed using targeted selected ion monitoring on a UHPLC-coupled quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Sixteen precursor ions from a total of 11 peptides unique to cTnT were targeted. Precursor ions were detectable up until 1200 ng/L cTnT, which is a typical cTnT concentration after AMI. With tandem-MS and relative quantification, we proved the formation of cTnT fragments upon incubation in human serum and identified differentially present peptides in the fragment bands, indicative of N- and C-terminal proteolytic cleavage. These findings are of importance for the development of future cTnT assays, calibrators and quality control samples.

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitation of serum samples was performed based upon the method by Michielsen et al [27]. Briefly, 10 µg biotinylated M11.7 antibody (epitope specificity: 146EQQRIRNEREKE157) was cross-linked to 1 mL M-270 Streptavidin dynabeads. Fifty µL of beads were then incubated with 200 µL serum for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads 4 times in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, immunoprecipitated cTnT was eluted in 25 µL 0.1 M citrate at pH 2.5 for 15 min at 56 °C. Seven µL of XT Sample Buffer were added to the eluates. One µL of the resulting sample was diluted 100 times for Western blotting; the remaining sample was used for SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.  After stacking for 15 min at 100 V, proteins were separated on 12% criterion XT precast gels for 45 min at 200 V using XT MOPS as running buffer.  Gels intended for Western blotting were then blotted on 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 100 V. Application of antibodies on the nitrocellulose membrane was performed using the SNAP i.d.® 2.0 protein detection system from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primary antibody used was the monoclonal M7 detector antibody by Roche Diagnostics (epitope specificity: 135DRIERR140). The secondary antibody was HRP-labelled goat anti mouse polyclonal antibody (GAMPO). Blots with attached antibodies were incubated in 1 mL Supersignal West Femto for 3 min before being detected with a Chemidoc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad).  Gels intended for Coomassie staining were first fixed in 100 mL 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution for 1 h, followed by staining with Bio-Safe™ Coomassie for 1 h under gentle agitation. Stained gels were washed overnight in water to reduce background after which an image was captured with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad). Gels were subsequently stored in 1% acetic acid solution (for a maximum of 1 week at 4 °C) until digestion.  Coomassie stained gel bands were carefully excised using a sharp razor blade in a flow cabinet. Gel slices were washed with 200 µL water. Precipitated proteins in the gel slices were reduced with 6.5 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature, followed by alkylation in 54 mM IAA for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The proteins were then digested with 60 ng trypsin in the presence of 0.01% ProteaseMAX™ surfactant for 3 h at 37 °C. The surfactant facilitates protein digestion by solubilising proteins and providing a denaturing environment. This eliminates the need for separate peptide extraction steps and drastically lowers digestion time [28]. All reagents (DTT, IAA, ProteaseMax and trypsin) were dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. In-between each step, the gel slices were dehydrated twice with 100 µL ACN before rehydration. TFA was added to the extracted peptides to a final concentration of 0.5% before LC-MS/MS analysis.  Peptides of interest were selected by the in silico digestion of cTnT using the targeted proteomics software platform Skyline [29]. A synthetic standard was created by pooling 13 synthesised cTnT peptides of interest in equimolar amounts. This standard was used to determine the retention times, ideal charge state and optimal normalised collision energy (NCE) of each individual peptide, as described in [30].  In addition, this standard was used as a quality control throughout the study and used to schedule the targeted measurements using an RT window of either  2 or 4 minutes. LC-MS/MS measurements were performed on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, connected to a UHPLC Dionex Ultimate 3000 by Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 100% water, solvent B consisted of 0.08% FA, 20% water, and 80% ACN. Peptides were first trapped on an Acclaim PepMap 100, 100 µm x 2 cm, C18, 5 µm, 100 A trap column in 0.1% TFA, 2% ACN and 98% water. Peptides were subsequently separated on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 µm x 15 cm, C18, 2 µm, 100 A analytical column by a 30 min gradient of 4-55% buffer B, followed by 55-90% B in 1 min and 90% B for 4 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. SIM was performed on selected m/z values as depicted in table 1 at a resolution of 70,000 FWHM at m/z 200, automatic gain control (AGC) of 100,000, maximum injection time of 250 ms and a detection window of 2.0 Th. Data dependent MS/MS was performed using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and detection of fragment spectra with an isolation window of 0.6 Th at a resolution of 35,000 FWHM at m/z 200, AGC of 50,000 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. NCE was optimised for each peptide and is shown in table 1. Dynamic exclusion was 10 s.

### Data Protocol
Measured MS/MS spectra were analysed using Proteome Discoverer, version 1.8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The database used was the reviewed human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (dated November 13, 2013) including all reviewed protein isoforms. The sequences of the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins (cRAP) were added for a total of 39,690 entries. Product ion spectra were searched against this database using the search engine SEQUEST. Precursor and product ion mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.1 Da, respectively. Enzyme specificity was set to semi-tryptic with 2 missed cleavages. Fixed value PSM validator was used at default Xcorr cut-offs. All accepted spectra were manually evaluated. Precursor ion chromatograms were analysed using Skyline version 2.6 [29]. The area under the curve (AUC) of each monoisotopic precursor (M) and its M+1 and M+2 isotopologues was calculated and summed; obtaining the total AUC of the corresponding precursor ion. For a chromatographic peak to be accepted, it needs to conform to the following three criteria: first, its retention time needs to be within ± 0.2 min of that of the synthetic standard. Second, its precursor ion mass error is at most ± 5 ppm. And third, a minimal isotopic dot product (idotp) of 0.95, and/or an adequate MS/MS spectrum positively identifying the selected peak. Dilution curves were created by plotting the abundance of each precursor ion as a function of the measured cTnT concentration of serially diluted samples in serum. The limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest cTnT concentration from the dilution series which was identified according to the above criteria. For the application of the method, a so-called precursor / reference  (P/R) ratio was calculated between the total AUC of each selected precursor ion (P) and the sum of the total AUCs of all selected precursor ions of a reference peptide (R). The reference peptide chosen was the peptide 187ALSNMMHFGGYIQK200. Because it contains 2 methionine residues, 4 precursor ions were selected corresponding to its 4 most common oxidation states (two single-oxidised, a double-oxidised and a non-oxidised state). Other methionine-containing peptides with multiple precursor ions also had their respective total AUCs summed to correct for differences in oxidation between samples. Calculated P/R ratios are normalised with respect to the highest value and presented as mean ± SEM with a sample size of 12, based on 3 independent experiments. Comparison of different ratios was performed using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni analysis where p ≤ 0.01 was considered statistically significant.
