### Title
A technique to identify context-based protein biomarkers: Application to a mouse liver cancer model

### Description
To date, most proteomic analyses towards cancer biomarker discovery have been based on protein quantification. However, proteins function in association with other proteins to form modules that are localized in specific subcellular compartments.  Cellular mislocalization of proteins has in fact been detected as a key feature in a variety of cancer cells1,2. Here, we describe a strategy for biomarker detection based on a mitochrondrial enrichment score (mtES), which is sensitive to protein abundance as well as protein translocation between mitochondria and cytosol. The mtES score integrates protein expression data from total cellular lysates and enriched mitochondrial fractions and provides important information for the classification of cancer samples, which is not apparent from conventional quantitative protein measurements. We apply the new strategy to a panel of wild-type and mutant mice that are either healthy or present liver cancer. We show that proteome changes based on mtES scores outperform protein abundance measurements in discriminating liver cancer from healthy liver tissue and that they are uniquely robust against strong genetic perturbation.  Overall, our method provides a more sensitive approach to cancer biomarker discovery that takes into account contextual information of tested proteins.

### Sample Protocol
To challenge our hypothesis in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-chemically induced mouse liver cancer model that causes distinctive metabolic perturbations, we proceeded, in parallel, with two proteomic experiments: one from total cellular liver lysate, the other from enriched mitochondrial fractions.

### Data Protocol
We identified and quantified over 2700 proteins in both experiments by using SWATH-MS.

### Publication Abstract
To-date, most proteomic studies aimed at discovering tissue-based cancer biomarkers have compared the quantity of selected proteins between case and control groups. However, proteins generally function in association with other proteins to form modules localized in particular subcellular compartments in specialized cell types and tissues. Sub-cellular mislocalization of proteins has in fact been detected as a key feature in a variety of cancer cells. Here, we describe a strategy for tissue-biomarker detection based on a mitochondrial fold enrichment (mtFE) score, which is sensitive to protein abundance changes as well as changes in subcellular distribution between mitochondria and cytosol. The mtFE score integrates protein abundance data from total cellular lysates and mitochondria-enriched fractions, and provides novel information for the classification of cancer samples that is not necessarily apparent from conventional abundance measurements alone. We apply this new strategy to a panel of wild-type and mutant mice with a liver-specific gene deletion of Liver receptor homolog 1 (Lrh-1<sup>hep-/-</sup>), with both lines containing control individuals as well as individuals with liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Lrh-1 gene deletion attenuates cancer cell metabolism in hepatocytes through mitochondrial glutamine processing. We show that proteome changes based on mtFE scores outperform protein abundance measurements in discriminating DEN-induced liver cancer from healthy liver tissue, and are uniquely robust against genetic perturbation. We validate the capacity of selected proteins with informative mtFE scores to indicate hepatic malignant changes in two independent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thus demonstrating the robustness of this new approach to biomarker research. Overall, the method provides a novel, sensitive approach to cancer biomarker discovery that considers contextual information of tested proteins.
