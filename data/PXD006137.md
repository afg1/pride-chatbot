### Title
Quick 96FASP for high throughput quantitative proteome analysis

### Description
An upgraded and quick 96FASP approach using 30k MWCO filter plates was developed for high throughput quantitative proteomics analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were processed using FASP protocol; LCMSMS were performed using QExactive MS (Thermo Scientific); data were processed using Proteome Discoverer and MaxQuant software.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using Proteome Discoverer and MaxQuant software.
