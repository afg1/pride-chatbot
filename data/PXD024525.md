### Title
Beta-blocker/ACE inhibitor therapy differentially impacts the steady state signaling landscape of failing and non-failing hearts.

### Description
Rationale: The molecular underpinnings of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) involves a complex remodeling of the contractile, metabolic and electrical functions. Current pharmacotherapy for patients presenting HFrEF includes combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and β-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-AR blockers). Yet, a knowledge gap exists regarding the molecular changes accompanying such treatment.  Objective: The present study takes an omics approach to study protein and phosphorylation signaling derangement in HFrEF and to define the global changes resulting from treatment with β-AR blocker (metoprolol) and ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in control- and HFrEF hearts.

### Sample Protocol
Mass spectrometry sample preparation The sample preparation was performed as described previously 14, 15.Frozen left ventricles from individual mice were homogenized separately using Precellys 24 (Bertin Instruments) in ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 10mM KCl, Complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet Roche, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM b-glycerophosphate). Samples were incubated rotating head-over-tail at 4°C  for 2 hours before centrifugation at 15,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Proteins were precipitated by adding four volumes of ice cold acetone and protein concentrations were measured (Quick Start Bradford Dye Reagent X1, Bio-Rad). Proteins were resuspended in Gnd-HCl buffer (6M Gnd-HCl, Complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet Roche, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM b-glycerophosphate ) and reduced and alkylated (5mM TCEP, 10mM chloroacetamide) in darkness for 15min before being digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100 for 1 hour at 30C followed by dilution (1:12 with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and digestion with trypsin (16 h) at 37 °C, 750 rpm (Life technologies, USA, 1:100 enzyme:protein ratio). Trypsin digestion was quenched by lowering the pH to ~2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 20 min, and supernatants were desalted and concentrated on Sep-Pack C18 cartridges (Waters). Peptides were eluted with 40% acetonitrile (ACN) followed by 60% ACN, and organic solvents subsequently evaporated by vacuum centrifugation. Peptide concentrations were measured and 500 µg peptide was taken aside for proteome measurements and the remainder was used for phosphopeptide enrichments. Peptide samples for proteome measurements were fractionated at high pH on an Ultimate3000 system (Thermo) as previously described 11. In brief, peptides were fractionated by micro-flow reverse-phase ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograpy (UPLC) on an Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC CSH C18 Column (130Å, 1.7 µm, 1 mm x 150 mm) at 30 μL/min flow rate. The following 85 min gradient elution programme was used employing a binary pump connected to Solvent A (5 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), pH 8) and B (100% ACN): 0–50 min: 4.5–22.5% B, 50–55 min: 22.5–63% B, 55–60 min: 63% B isocratic, 60–62 min: 63–81% B, 62–70 min: 81% B isocratic, 70–75 min: 81–4.5% B, followed by column re-equilibration at 4.5% B for 10 min. Outflow from 4–60 min was collected in 1-min intervals into 12 concatenated fractions in the autosampler. Fractions were acidified by addition of 5 μL 5% formic acid and fraction volume was reduced by vacuum centrifugation. If not specified otherwise, chemicals and reagents were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Chromatography solvents were acquired from VWR, USA. Phosphopeptides were enriched with TiO2 beads essentially as described previously 14, 16. Three milligram of TiO2 beads (GL Sciences Inc.) suspended in 10 µl 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) [0.02 g DHB/ml 80% ACN, 0.5% acetic acid (AcOH)] were used per sample. Beads were pre-incubated with mixing before being added to each of the samples, which were then incubated with gentle rotation for 30 min at 30 rpm. The TiO2 beads were quickly spun down, and the supernatants were removed. The beads were washed with 80% Acetonitrile, 6% TFA  and transferred onto in-house packed C8 stage-tips. While on the coloumn, beads were washed with first 80% Acetonitrile, 6% TFA, followed by 50% Acetonitrile, 6% TFA, then 10% Acetonitrile, 6% TFA and lastly 80% Acetonitrile, 6% TFA. Samples were eluted with 20 ul of 5% NH4OH followed by 20μL 10% NH4OH, 25% ACN. Ammonia and organic solvents were evaporated with a vacuum centrifuge. The peptides were then acidified in 1% TFA, 5% ACN and loaded onto in-house packed C18 stage-tips, where they were stored until measurement.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data analysis  Raw MS data was processed using the MaxQuant software (Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Munich) and proteins identified with the built-in Andromeda search engine by searching MS/MS spectra against an in-silico tryptic digest of a database containing all reviewed SwissProt mouse protein entries (downloaded on 05/03/2020). For the proteome dataset the MS/MS spectra were searched with Carbamidomethyl-Cysteine as fixedmodification, as well as oxidation (M), acetylation of protein N-termini whereas for phospho-proteome dataset in addition to fixed modification, phospho (STY) as variable modifications was used. Due to the similarity of the samples the match-between-runs option was enabled with default parameters. The minimum peptide length was set to seven amino acids (default) peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerant to 0.02 Da. False-discovery rate cut-offs were set to 1 % on peptide, protein, only allowing high-quality identifications to pass. All peptides were used for protein quantification. Animal inclusion criteria in the final proteomic and phosphoproteomics evaluation were that the ejection fraction at the time point of implanting osmotic minipumps were within two standard deviations of the average of the group. For two animals, the phosphoproteomics experiments failed technically leading to identification of only 2719 (SHAMVh) and 344 (TACTr) phosphorylated peptides, respectively. Those animals were accordingly removed form subsequent analysis. All data were filtered for decoy and contaminant proteins. For the phospho-proteomic dataset, intensities were log2 transformed and median normalized using an in-house python script. For the proteomic dataset log2 transformed LFQ intensities were used, and therefore no normalization was performed. Post filtering the dataset, remaining missing values were imputed using downshift imputation method where values were drawn from a distribution with width 0.03 and downshift 1.8 compared to the original sample distribution.

### Publication Abstract
Heart failure is a multifactorial disease that affects an estimated 38 million people worldwide. Current pharmacotherapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) includes combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and &#x3b2;-adrenergic receptor blockers (&#x3b2;-AR blockers), a therapy also used as treatment for non-cardiac conditions. Our knowledge of the molecular changes accompanying treatment with ACEi and &#x3b2;-AR blockers is limited. Here, we applied proteomics and phosphoproteomics approaches to profile the global changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation state in cardiac left ventricles consequent to combination therapy of &#x3b2;-AR blocker and ACE inhibitor in HFrEF and control hearts. The phosphorylation changes induced by treatment were profoundly different for failing than for non-failing hearts. HFrEF was characterized by profound downregulation of mitochondrial proteins coupled with derangement of &#x3b2;-adrenergic and pyruvate dehydrogenase signaling. Upon treatment, phosphorylation changes consequent to HFrEF were reversed. In control hearts, treatment mainly led to downregulation of canonical PKA signaling. The observation of divergent signaling outcomes depending on disease state underscores the importance of evaluating drug effects within the context of the specific conditions present in the recipient heart.
