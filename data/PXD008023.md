### Title
nuclear proteomics of glioma cells infected with an oncolytic adenovirus

### Description
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of malignant glioma. Oncolytic adenoviruses are being modified to exploit the aberrant expression of proteins in tumor cells to enhance tumor tropism and glioma-selective replication. E1A mutant adenovirus Delta-24-RGD has shown favorable toxicity profile and remarkable efficacy in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial. However, the comprehensive modulation of glioma metabolism in response to Delta-24-RGD infection is poorly understood. Integrating mass spectrometry based-quantitative proteomics, physical and functional interaction data, and biochemical approaches, we conducted a cell-wide study of cytosolic, nuclear, and secreted glioma proteomes throughout the early time course of Delta-24-RGD infection.

### Sample Protocol
Nuclear proteome analysis. Nuclear extracts from Mock-infected, and U87-infected cells (at 6 and 10hpi) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 1 mm thick polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. The run was stopped as soon as the front entered 3 mm into the resolving gel so that the whole proteome became concentrated in the stacking/resolving gel interface. Bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and excised from the gel. Protein enzymatic cleavage (15ug) was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37°C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko, A. et al., In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes. Nat Protoc 1 (6), 2856 (2006). Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore).

### Data Protocol
Data analysis for nuclear proteomes. The peptide quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC−MS software (ver. 2.0.5556.29015, Nonlinear Dynamics). Using the accurate mass measurements from full survey scans in the TOF detector and the observed retention times, runs were aligned to compensate for between-run variations in our nanoLC separation system. To this end, all runs were aligned to a reference run automatically chosen by the software, and a master list of features considering m/z values and retention times was generated. The quality of these alignments was manually supervised with the help of quality scores provided by the software. The peptide identifications were exported from Protein Pilot software and imported in Progenesis LC− MS software where they were matched to the respective features. Output data files were managed for subsequent statistical analyses and representation. Proteins identified by site (identification based only on a modification), reverse proteins (identified by decoy database) and potential contaminants were filtered out. Proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides, an ANOVA p-value lower than 0.05, and an absolute fold change of <0.77 (down-regulation) or >1.3 (up-regulation) in linear scale were considered significantly differentially expressed.

### Publication Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of malignant glioma. Oncolytic adenoviruses are being modified to exploit the aberrant expression of proteins in tumor cells to increase the antiglioma efficacy. E1A mutant adenovirus Delta-24-RGD (DNX-2401) has shown a favorable toxicity profile and remarkable efficacy in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial. However, the comprehensive modulation of glioma metabolism in response to Delta-24-RGD infection is poorly understood. Integrating mass spectrometry based-quantitative proteomics, physical and functional interaction data, and biochemical approaches, we conducted a cell-wide study of cytosolic, nuclear, and secreted glioma proteomes throughout the early time course of Delta-24-RGD infection. In addition to the severe proteostasis impairment detected during the first hours post-infection (hpi), Delta-24-RGD induces a transient inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and transcription factor AP-1 (c-JUN) between 3 and 10hpi, increasing the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B) activity at 6hpi. Furthermore, Delta-24-RGD specifically modulates the activation dynamics of protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways early in infection. At extracellular level, Delta-24-RGD triggers a time -dependent dynamic production of multitasking cytokines, and chemotactic factors, suggesting potential pleiotropic effects on the immune system reactivation. Taken together, these data help us to understand the mechanisms used by Delta-24-RGD to exploit glioma proteome organization. Further mining of this proteomic resource may enable design and engineering complementary adenoviral based-vectors to increase the specificity and potency against glioma.
