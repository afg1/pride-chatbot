### Title
The impact of hypoxia on the cytotoxic T lymphocyte proteome

### Description
Metabolic and nutrient-sensing pathways play an important role in controlling the efficacy of effector T cells. Oxygen is a critical regulator of cellular metabolism. However, during immune responses T cells must function in oxygen-deficient, or hypoxic, environments. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate how hypoxia configures the proteome of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). We identified and quantified over 7,600 proteins and discovered that hypoxia increased the abundance of a selected number of proteins in CTLs. This included glucose transporters, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, cytolytic effector molecules, checkpoint receptors and adhesion molecules. While some of these proteins may augment the effector functions of CTLs, others may limit their cytotoxicity. These data provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the magnitude of the CTL response to hypoxia and emphasise the importance of oxygen-sensing pathways for controlling CD8+ T cells. Additionally, this study provides new understanding about how hypoxia may promote the effector function of CTLs, while contributing to their dysfunction in some contexts.   For this project, P14 cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were generated from T cells from the spleens of mice. CD8+ T cells were activated for 2 days with the P14-T cell receptor (TCR) cognate ligand (peptide gp33-41 from Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus, LCMV) in the presence of 20 ng/ml IL 2 (Proleukin) and 2 ng/ml IL-12 (Peprotech). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator with a gas atmosphere of 18% oxygen and 5% CO2 and a temperature of 37�C. After 48 hours, the activated CD8+ T cells were removed from TCR stimulation and were cultured in RPMI 1640, with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin-G, 100 �g/ml streptomycin, 50 �M-mercaptoethanol and 20 ng/ml IL-2 (Proleukin). Each day, the T cells were counted and split to 500,000 cells per ml with fresh IL-2 being added to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. CTLs were differentiated in IL-2 for 4 days, before being counted and re-suspended at a concentration of 300,000 cells per ml in RPMI with 10% foetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-G, 50 �g/ml streptomycin, 50 �M-mercaptoethanol and 20 ng/ml IL-2. A volume of 8 mls of the cell suspension was plated per well of a 6 well plate, and the CTLs were either maintained in a gas atmosphere of 18% oxygen and 5% CO2 or transferred to an atmosphere of 1% O2 and 5% CO2 in a Galaxy 48 R incubator (Eppendorf) for 24 hours. Three biological replicates (CTLs generated from three separate spleens) were analysed in this experiment."

### Sample Protocol
CTLs were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in 15 mls PBS. Cell pellets were mixed with lysis buffer (4% SDS, 50 mM TEAB pH 8.5, 10 mM TCEP) at 22°C under agitation for 5 minutes, boiled for 5 minutes and then cooled before sonication (15 cycles of 30-seconds-on and 30-seconds-off) using an UP200St with VialTweeter (Hielscher Ultrasound Technology) without cooling. Following protein quantitation, the samples were incubated with 20 mM iodoacetamide to alkylate reduced cysteines. The Single-Pot Solid-Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3) procedure (PMID: 25358341) was used for protein clean-up and digest. A 1:1 mix of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Sera-Mag SpeedBead Carboxylate-Modified Magnetic Particles was added to each protein sample. A 10:1 acetonitrile:formic acid mix was added to the samples to allow the proteins to bind to the beads. The bead-protein complexes were immobilized using a magnetic rack to allow removal of the supernatant, and to allow washing (once with 70% (v/v) ethanol and then once with acetonitrile). After air drying, the beads were re-suspended in digest buffer (0.1% (v/v) SDS; 50 mM TEAB, pH 8.5; 1 mM CaCl2). LysC (Wako) was added at a ratio of 50:1 protein:LysC and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. Then Trypsin (Promega) was added at a ratio of 50:1 protein:Trypsin, and left for 24 hours at 37°C. After the incubation with the proteases, acetonitrile was added to the digest mix, to give a final concentration of >95% (v/v) acetonitrile. The bead-peptide complexes were immobilised using a magnetic rack, the acetonitrile/digest buffer mix was removed, and the samples were washed with acetonitrile. The peptides were eluted in 2% (v/v) DMSO. Formic acid was added to the peptides to give a final concentration of 5% (v/v) formic acid. Peptide samples were fractionated off-line by high pH reverse-phase liquid chromatography using an UltiMate 3000 BioRS system equipped with a 2.1 mm × 150 mm Xbridge Peptide BEH C18 column with 3.5 μm particles (Waters). For the separation, the buffers used were 10 mM ammonium formate at pH 9 in 2% (v/v) acetonitrile (RPLC buffer A) and 10 mM ammonium formate at pH 9 in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (RPLC buffer B). The samples were separated using a 25 minute multistep gradient of RPLC buffer A and RPLC buffer B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml per minute. Peptides were separated into 16 fractions using a concatenation collection method. The fractions were dried using a SpeedVac (Genevac).  This study comprises a total of 96 HPLC-MS/MS runs. Mass spectrometry was performed by the Proteomics Facility, University of Dundee, UK. Analysis of peptides was performed on a Velos Pro Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific). The liquid chromatography (LC) buffers were LC buffer A (0.1% formic acid (v/v) in Milli-Q water) and LC buffer B (80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.08% (v/v) formic acid in Milli-Q water). Dried peptide samples were reconstituted in 50 µl of 1% (v/v) formic acid and 7 μL of each sample were loaded at 10 μl/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in LC buffer A for 19 minutes. The trap column was washed for 3 minutes at the same flow rate before the trap column was switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å) kept at a constant temperature of 50°C and equilibrated in 2% LC buffer B for 19 minutes. Peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/minute with a linear gradient from 2% LC buffer B to 5% LC buffer B within 3 minutes, then from 5% LC buffer B to 35% LC buffer B in 124 minutes and finally from 35% LC buffer B to 98% LC buffer B in 2 minutes. The column was then washed for 20 minutes at 98% LC buffer B and re-equilibrated in 2% LC buffer B for 19 minutes. The LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro was operated in data dependent positive ionization mode using an Easy-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo scientific). The source voltage was set to 1.9 Kv and the capillary temperature was 250°C. A scan cycle comprised MS1 scan (m/z range from 335-1800) in the Velos Pro Orbitrap followed by 15 sequential dependant MS2 scans (the threshold value was set at 5,000 and the minimum injection time was set at 200 ms) in the LTQ (Linear Trap Quadrupole) with collision induced dissociation using the following parameters: isolation width 2, normalized collision energy 35, default charge state 2, activation Q 0.25 and activation time, 10 ms. The resolution of the Orbitrap Velos was set to 60,000 after accumulation of 1,000,000 ions. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled, with all unassigned charge states and singly charged species rejected. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy.

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometry data files were processed using MaxQuant version 1.6.0.1 which incorporates the Andromeda search engine. Spectra were mapped to the reviewed UniProtKB mouse protein database (“uniprot-reviewed MusMusculus 020817 Canonical+isoforms”) and the contaminant database supplied by MaxQuant. The following search parameters were used: trypsin and LysC were selected as the proteases; up to two missed cleavages were permitted; the minimum peptide length was set to 6 amino acids; protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, glutamine to pyroglutamate, glutamine and asparagine deamidation were selected as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification; MS tolerance of 20 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of 0.5 Da; label free quantification was enabled. False discovery rates (FDRs) were set to 0.01 and based on hits against the reversed sequence database. This cut-off was applied to individual spectra (peptides and modification sites) and whole proteins in the MaxQuant output. The match between runs function was enabled. Proteins were quantified on the basis of unique (found only in a specific protein group) and razor peptides (peptides assigned to a specific protein group without being unique to that group) with the re-quantification feature enabled.

### Publication Abstract
Metabolic and nutrient-sensing pathways play an important role in controlling the efficacy of effector T cells. Oxygen is a critical regulator of cellular metabolism. However, during immune responses T cells must function in oxygen-deficient, or hypoxic, environments. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate how the proteome of primary murine CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is reconfigured in response to hypoxia <i>in vitro</i>. We identified and quantified over 7,600 proteins and discovered that hypoxia increased the abundance of a selected number of proteins in CTLs. This included glucose transporters, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, cytolytic effector molecules, checkpoint receptors and adhesion molecules. While some of these proteins may augment the effector functions of CTLs, others may limit their cytotoxicity. Moreover, we determined that hypoxia could inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation cues and antigen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in CTLs. These data provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the magnitude of the CTL response to hypoxia and emphasise the importance of oxygen-sensing pathways for controlling CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additionally, this study provides new understanding about how hypoxia may promote the effector function of CTLs, while contributing to their dysfunction in some contexts.
