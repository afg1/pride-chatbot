### Title
Apple snail perivitelline fluid LC-MS/MS

### Description
Proteins were extracted from the perivitelline fluid of the apple snail Pomacea maculata eggs. And then proteins were seperated on SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by LTQ-Orbitrap Elite coupled to an Easy-nLC.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins which were extracted from perivitelline fluid of the apple snail Pomacea maculata eggs were dissolved in 8M urea, then sonicated, centrifuged to get supernatant protein solution. Then the protein solutions (around 100 mg proteins) were run on SDS-PAGE gel, and fractioned into 10 slices. After trypsin digestion, the peptides were analyzed on LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw LC-MS/MS data files were converted into .mgf files using Proteome Discovery 1.3.0.339 (Thermo Finnigan, CA).
