### Title
Trichodesmium erythraeum sp. IMS101 Diel proteomes

### Description
Global proteomes of Trichodesmium erythraeum sp. IMS101 over the diel cycle. Cells were grown in a 14:10 day/light incubator with mimicked dusk and dawn illumination. Sampling occurred every 1-3 hours with concentrated sampling around dawn and dusk.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were collected from the batch culture onto 0.2um supor filters and frozen at -80C until analysis. Cells were lysed in 1% SDS and trypsin digested in gel. They were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion using two in-line columns (PLRP-S followed by a C18) with active modulation.

### Data Protocol
Peptide to spectrum matching was performed in SEQUEST in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 with the Trichodesmium erythraeum sp. IMS101 genome as the sequence database. Statistical validation was performed in Scaffold(Proteome Software) at the 1% protein and peptide FDR levels.
