### Title
C. thermocellum dHydG Acetate LC-MS/MS

### Description
Deletion of a hydrogenase maturation factor (HydG) knocks out the assembly of mature, functioning hydrogenases to divert metabolic flux away from hydrogen production and towards ethanol. Other system-wide affects assessed.

### Sample Protocol
C. thermocellum cells were grown in biological triplicate, proteins obtained via SDS/TCA/Urea modified FASP, and analyzed by 24-hr MudPIT LC-MS. Orbitrap Velos Pro was operated in DDA using a high mass accuracy in both MS1 and MS2 scans.

### Data Protocol
Spectra assiged to peptide sequences via MyriMatch (v2.1)and IDPicker (v3.0). Spectra counts were measured, assigned nSpC values, and imported into JMP genomics to assign significant changers across conditions via ANOVA. Semiquantitative analysis with replication.
