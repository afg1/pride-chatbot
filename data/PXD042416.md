### Title
Peptide collision cross section of 22 post-translational modifications

### Description
The present study investigates the ion mobility characteristics of synthetic peptides carrying 22 different post-translational modifications by Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry. Samples were kindly provided by the ProteomeTools project.

### Sample Protocol
A library of ~5,000 synthetic peptides carrying 21 different post-translational were obtained from the ProteomeTools project. Additionally we purchased synthetic O-GlcNAcylated peptides from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (SpikeMix PTM-Kit 57 and 55). Peptides were analyzed in data dependent acquisition mode using a TIMS quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker timsTOF Pro). Modifications comprise: Lysine acetylation, biotinylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, dimethylation, formylation, glutarylation, hydroxyisobutyrylation, malonylation, methylation, propionylation, succinylation, trimethylation and glyglycylation (ubiquitination). Arginine citrullination, dimethyalation (symmetric/asymmetric), methylation. Hydroxyproline. Tyrosine nitration, phosphorylation. Serine/Threonine O GlcNAcylation.

### Data Protocol
Bruker .d files were processed with MaxQuant (version 2.1.4.0). MS/MS spectra were searched against either concatenated peptide sequences as provided by the ProteomeTools consortium or separated peptide sequences as provided by JPT. Characterization of ion mobility characteristics was performed using custom R scripts (https://github.com/MeierLab).
