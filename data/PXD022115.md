### Title
Thermal proteome profiling of temporal dynamics of infection of SARS-CoV-2

### Description
We performed two dimensional thermal proteome profiling (2D-TPP) to profile the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 cells.

### Sample Protocol
After heating, lysing and extraction of remaining soluble protein fraction (with a modified thermal proteome profiling protocol - Savitski et al., Science (2014), samples were processed with a modified SP3 protocol, digested using trypsin and labeled with TMT. Shotgun proteomics using a Q-Exactive Orbitrap was then performed.

### Data Protocol
TMT quantification was used, by using the isobarquant python package (Franken et al., Nat Protoc (2015)), and Mascot 2.4 was used for protein identification. Search parameters: trypsin, missed cleavages 3, peptide tolerance 10ppm, 0.02Da for MS/MS tolerance. Fixed modifications were carbamidomethyl on cysteines and TMT10plex on lysine. Variable modifications included acetylation on protein N-terminus, oxidation of methionine and TMT10plex on peptide N-termini. The R programming language was used to analyze the output data.

### Publication Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global threat to human health and has compromised economic stability. In addition to the development of an effective vaccine, it is imperative to understand how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cellular machineries on a system-wide scale so that potential host-directed therapies can be developed. In situ proteome-wide abundance and thermal stability measurements using thermal proteome profiling (TPP) can inform on global changes in protein activity. Here we adapted TPP to high biosafety conditions amenable to SARS-CoV-2 handling. We discovered pronounced temporal alterations in host protein thermostability during infection, which converged on cellular processes including cell cycle, microtubule and RNA splicing regulation. Pharmacological inhibition of host proteins displaying altered thermal stability or abundance during infection suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication. Overall, this work serves as a framework for expanding TPP workflows to globally important human pathogens that require high biosafety containment and provides deeper resolution into the molecular changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
