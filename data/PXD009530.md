### Title
Physcomitrella patens secreted endogenous peptides

### Description
We used mass spectrometry to comprehensively analyze the endogenous peptide pools generated from functionally active proteins in the secretome fromthe model plant Physcomitrella patens. Treatment with the plant stress hormones methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid induced significant differential changes in the peptide pool.

### Sample Protocol
Protonemata of the moss P. patens subsp. patens Gransden 2004 were grown in 200 mL liquid Knop medium with 500 mg/L ammonium tartrate. Secreted peptides were extracted from 400 mL protonemata culture medium. The culture medium was filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane filter (Millipore), lyophilized and resuspended in 500 μL 5% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation at 10,000  × g for 10 min. Peptides were isolated from the culture medium by solid-phase extraction on reverse-phase DSC18 cartridges (Discovery DSC-18, Supelco) using 50% and 80% acetonitrile solutions for the elution. The eluted peptides were concentrated in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 5% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The pool of peptides was isolated by solid-phase extraction in ZipTip Pipette tips (Millipore) using a 50% acetonitrile solution for the elution. Eluted peptides were concentrated in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 5% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by mass-spectrometry analysis of all prepared samples.

### Data Protocol
Mass-spectrometry data were searched with MaxQuant v1.5.8.3 against a database containing the protein sequences from Phytozome v12.0 merged with chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins and sequences from a database of common contaminant proteins (Tyanova et al., 2016). The MaxQuant protein FDR filter was disabled, while the peptide FDR remained at 1%. The parameter “Digestion Mode” was set to “unspecific”, and modifications were not allowed. All other parameters were left at default values.
