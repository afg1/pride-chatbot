### Title
Spatial distribution of proteins and metabolites in developing wheat grain and their differential regulatory response during the grain filling process

### Description
Grain filling and proper grain development are essential biological processes in the plant’s life cycle, which majorly contributes to the final seed yield and quality in all cereal crop. However, very scarcely this knowledge is available in the literature regarding how the different wheat grain components contribute to the overall development of the seed. We performed a proteomics and metabolomics analysis in four different developing components of the wheat grain (seed coat, embryo, endosperm and cavity fluid) to characterize molecular processes during early and late grain development. In-gel shotgun proteomics analysis in 12, 15, 20 and 25 days after anthesis (DAA) lead us to identify and quantify 15,484 proteins out of which 410 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the seed coat, 815 in embryo, 372 in endosperm and 492 in cavity fluid. The abundance of selected protein candidates revealed spatially and temporally resolved protein functions associated with development and grain filling. Multiple proteins such as pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and 14 -3- 3 undergo a major change in abundance during wheat grain development. Proteins binned into the functional category of cell growth /division were highly expressed during early stages (12 and 15 DAA) whereas those of starch biosynthesis in the middle or late stages. At the metabolome level all tissues and especially the cavity fluid showed highly distinct metabolite profiles. The tissue specific data are integrated with biochemical networks to explore a comprehensive map of molecular processes during grain filling and developmental processes.

### Sample Protocol
Frozen grain components such as seed coat, embryo and endosperm were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and proteins were extracted according to (Ghatak et al., 2016, Jegadeesan et al., 2018). In brief, homogenized grain tissue weighed (30 mg for seed coat, endosperm, embryo and 30µl of cavity fluid respectively) and suspended in 200 µl of protein extraction buffer (100 mM Tris‐HCl, pH 8.0; 5% SDS, 10% glycerol; 10 mM DTT; 1% plant protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma P9599) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min followed by incubation for 2.5 min at 95 °C and centrifugation at 21000 g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube. Two‐hundred microliters of 1.4 M sucrose were added to the supernatant and proteins were extracted twice with 200 µl TE buffer‐equilibrated phenol followed by counter extraction with 400 µl of 0.7 M sucrose. Phenol phases were combined and subsequently mixed with 2.5 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol for precipitation of proteins. After 16 h of incubation at −20 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g. The pellet was washed twice with 0.1 M ammonium acetate, once with acetone and air‐dried at room temperature. The pellet was re‐dissolved in 6 M Urea and 5% SDS, and protein concentration were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA method). Proteins were pre‐fractionated by SDS‐PAGE. Forty micrograms of total protein were loaded onto the gel. Gels were fixed and stained with methanol/acetic acid/water/Coomassie Brilliant Blue R‐250 (40:10:50:0.001). Gels were destained in methanol/water (40:60). Gel pieces were destained, equilibrated and digested with trypsin, desalted and concentrated (Chaturvedi et al., 2013, Chaturvedi et al., 2015). Prior to mass spectrometric measurement, the tryptic peptide pellets were dissolved in 4% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. One µg of each sample (3 replicates for each component and each developing stage) was loaded on a C18 reverse-phase column (Thermo scientific, EASY‐Spray 500 mm, 2 µm particle size). The separation was achieved with a 90 min gradient from 98% solution A (0.1% formic acid) and 2% solution B (90% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) at 0 min to 40% solution B (90% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) at 90 min with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. nESI‐MS/MS measurements were performed on Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with the following settings: Full scan range 350–1800 m/z resolution 120000 max. 20 MS2 scans (activation type CID), repeat count 1, repeat duration 30 s, exclusion list size 500, exclusion duration 30 s, charge state screening enabled with the rejection of unassigned and +1 charge states, minimum signal threshold 500.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were searched with the SEQUEST algorithm present in Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 (Thermo, Germany) as described previously (Chaturvedi et al., 2013, Chaturvedi et al., 2015). We have used the following settings in Proteome Discoverer for data analysis which include: Peptide confidence: High, which is equivalent to 1% false discovery rate (FDR), and Xcorr of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for peptides of charge 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The variable modifications were set to acetylation of N‐terminus and methionine oxidation, with a mass tolerance of 10 ppm for parent ion and 0.8 Da for the fragment ion. The number of missed and non‐specific cleavages permitted was 2. There were no fixed modifications, as dynamic modifications were used (Paul et al., 2016). For identification, the UniProt database containing the annotation of 136,865 genes for wheat was used.  Peptides were matched against these databases plus decoys, considering a significant hit when the peptide confidence was high. The identified proteins were quantitated based on total ion count, followed by an NSAF normalization strategy (Paoletti et al., 2006):  (𝑁𝑆𝐴𝐹)𝜅=(𝑃𝑆𝑀/𝐿)𝜅/∑𝑖=1𝑁(𝑃𝑆𝑀/𝐿)𝑖 The total number spectra count for the matching peptides from protein k (PSM) were divided by the protein length (L), then divided by the sum of PSM/L for all N proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Grain filling and grain development are essential biological processes in the plant's life cycle, eventually contributing to the final seed yield and quality in all cereal crops. Studies of how the different wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain components contribute to the overall development of the seed are very scarce. We performed a proteomics and metabolomics analysis in four different developing components of the wheat grain (seed coat, embryo, endosperm, and cavity fluid) to characterize molecular processes during early and late grain development. In-gel shotgun proteomics analysis at 12, 15, 20, and 26&#xa0;days after anthesis (DAA) revealed 15 484 identified and quantified proteins, out of which 410 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the seed coat, 815 in the embryo, 372 in the endosperm, and 492 in the cavity fluid. The abundance of selected protein candidates revealed spatially and temporally resolved protein functions associated with development and grain filling. Multiple wheat protein isoforms involved in starch synthesis such as sucrose synthases, starch phosphorylase, granule-bound and soluble starch synthase, pyruvate phosphate dikinase, 14-3-3 proteins as well as sugar precursors undergo a major tissue-dependent change in abundance during wheat grain development suggesting an intimate interplay of starch biosynthesis control. Different isoforms of the protein disulfide isomerase family as well as glutamine levels, both involved in the glutenin macropolymer pattern, showed distinct spatial and temporal abundance, revealing their specific role as indicators of wheat gluten quality. Proteins binned into the functional category of cell growth/division and protein synthesis/degradation were more abundant in the early stages (12 and 15 DAA). At the metabolome level all tissues and especially the cavity fluid showed highly distinct metabolite profiles. The tissue-specific data are integrated with biochemical networks to generate a comprehensive map of molecular processes during grain filling and developmental processes.
