### Title
CHD7- and HDAC1/2-dependent chromatin remodeling activities cooperate to promote DNA double-strand break repair

### Description
The DNA double-strand break (DSB) response is a multi-step process that requires chromatin reorganization at each stage. 53BP1 is a nodal point in this response as it directs chromatin-based DSB repair. However, how chromatin reorganization impacts DSB repair upstream of 53BP1 is not fully understood. Here we reveal that Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 7 (CHD7) rapidly recruits to damaged chromatin in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent manner. CHD7 facilitates chromatin relaxation and the loading of canonical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) factors, while restraining 53BP1 accumulation at DSBs. Moreover, CHD7 physically associates with HDAC1/2, thereby recruiting this complex to DNA breaks independently of its chromatin remodeling activity. HDAC1/2 promote histone H4 de-acetylation and chromatin re-compaction to prevent supraphysiological retention of cNHEJ factors at DBSs. Thus, the cooperation between distinct yet coordinated chromatin remodeling activities driven by CHD7 and HDAC1/2 ensures proper assembly dynamics of the cNHEJ machinery and efficient DSB repair.

### Sample Protocol
For stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) labeling, U2OS cells were cultured for 14 days in media containing ‘heavy’ (H) and ‘light’ (L) labeled forms of the amino acids arginine and lysine respectively. SILAC-labeled cells were transiently transfected with GFP-CHD7 (H) or empty GFP vector (L) and equal amounts of H- and L-labelled cells were lysed in EBC buffer as described above. GFP-CHD7 (H) or empty GFP vector control (L) lysates were subjected to immunoprecipition using GFP Trap beads as described above. The beads were subsequently washed 2 times with EBC buffer and 2 times with 50mM (NH4)2CO3 followed by overnight digestion using 2.5μg trypsin at 37°C under constant shaking. Peptides of the H and L precipitates were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and desalted using a Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge by washing with 0.1 % acetic acid. Finally, peptides were eluted with 0.1% acetic acid / 60% acetonitrile and lyophilized.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry was performed as described previously (Schimmel et al., 2014). A single sample was analyzed on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nanoLC 1000 system (Proxeon). Digested peptides were separated using a 13cm fused silica capillary (ID: 75μm, OD: 375μm, Polymicro Technologies, California, US) in-house packed with 1.8μm C18 beads (ReprospherDE, Pur, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were separated by liquid chromatography using a gradient from 2% to 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min for 2 hours. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive-ion mode at 2.2 kV with the capillary heated to 200°C. Data-dependent acquisition mode was used to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS scans, employing a top 10 method. Full scan MS spectra were obtained with a resolution of 70,000, a target value of 3x106 and a scan range from 400 to 2,000 m/z. Higher-Collisional Dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were recorded with a resolution of 17,500, a target value of 1x105 and a normalized collision energy of 25%. The precursor ion masses selected for MS/MS analysis were subsequently dynamically excluded from MS/MS analysis for 60 sec. Precursor ions with a charge state of 1 and greater than 6 were excluded from triggering MS/MS events. The raw MS file was analyzed with the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.5.5.1; Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry).
