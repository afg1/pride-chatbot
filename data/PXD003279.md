### Title
Analysis of the MAGED2 interactome

### Description
The MAGED2 interactome was analyzed in HEK293T cells using three different strategies.

### Sample Protocol
For interactomic study 1, HEK293T cells were transfected using a plasmid containing FLAG-tagged MAGED-2 WT and R446C.  For interactomic study 2 and 3, HEK293T without transfection were utilized. Cells were lysed in IP Buffer (containing 20mM Tris 7,5 buffer, 1% TX100, 50mM NaCl, 12,5mM Na4P2O7, 25mM NaF and 1x Protease inhibitor mix (Roche)). Lysates were cleared using centrifugation of 16000g at 4 degrees for 20 mins. For study 1, supernatant was incubated with anti-DYKDDDDK µ beads (Miltenyi) for 1 hour. For study 2 and 3, supernatant was incubated with the respective MAGED2 antibodies (HPA031572, HPA031573, Atlas antibodies,1µg/ 800µL) for 1h, followed by incubation with protein-G beads (Milenyi, 50 µl) for 1h. Immunoprecipitates were washed using magnetic µ-columns (Miltenyi) and on-column tryptic digestion (c=5ng/µl) was performed as previously described 1.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using MaxQuant as indicated in the method seciton of the accompanying paper.
