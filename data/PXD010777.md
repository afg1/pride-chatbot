### Title
Analysis of the TBK1 interactors from TBK1-deficient A549 cells reconstituted with moTAP TBK1 or empty vector

### Description
This study aimed at determining the proteins that interact with TBK1.

### Sample Protocol
TAP-purified TBK1 from TBK1-deficient A549 cells reconstituted with moTAP TBK1 or empty vector followed by tryptic digestion.

### Data Protocol
Peptide mixtures were analysed by data dependent acquisition on the Q-Exactive Plus coupled to nLC. Data was searched by MaxQuant against the human UniProt database and proteins were filtered at a 1% false discovery rate.
