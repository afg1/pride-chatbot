### Title
Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens from urine samples by mass spectrometry

### Description
SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a major public health burden and is known to affect many organs with the respiratory system being involved in a majority of cases. Here we undertook a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to test whether viral proteins could be detected in urine of patients with COVID-19. Urine samples from 39 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were analysed by mass spectrometry. We detected peptides from the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 13 out of 39 urine samples. Thus, our findings suggest that viral proteins present in the urine can be detected by mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Urine sample from negative patients and COVID-19 patient were collected and were inactivated at 70°C for 30 minutes. These samples were then incubated with1 µg of anti-nucleocapsid antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 ºC, the samples were incubated with 50 µl of streptavidin beads for 30 minutes. The immunoprecipitated samples were then washed three times with PBS. After the last wash, the beads were left to dry and captured nucleocapsid protein was eluted with two successive additions of 25 µl of elution buffer (0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA), 50% acetonitrile, 0.02% ZWITTERGENT® 3-16 Detergent. Eluted nucleocapsid protein was neutralized with 150 µl of Rapid Digest buffer.  The samples were then digested with 0.5 µg of trypsin at 70°C for 1 hour. The digested peptides were then cleaned and analyzed on high resolution Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer interfaced with nanoflow liquid chromatography system.

### Data Protocol
The raw mass spectrometry data was searched using Andromeda in MaxQuant software suite (version 1.6.7.0) and  Sequest and Mascot through Proteome Discoverer 2.3.0.523 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) against a combined protein database of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, SARS-CoV proteins, common coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63 and L229E) and UniProt human protein database including common MS contaminants. The search parameters included trypsin as the enzyme with a maximum of two missed cleavages; N-terminal acetylation and oxidation at methionine as variable modifications.
