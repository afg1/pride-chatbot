### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 in response to industrial cyanide-containing wastewaters

### Description
Biological treatments to degrade cyanide have shown to be a powerful technology for cyanide removal from industrial wastewaters. It has been previously demonstrated that the alkaliphilic bacterium Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 is able to use free cyanide and several metal−cyanide complexes as the sole nitrogen source. The strain CECT5344 has been used for detoxification of the different chemical forms of cyanide that are present in alkaline wastewaters from the electroplating process of the jewelry industry. This liquid residue also contains large concentrations of metals like iron, copper and zinc, making this wastewater even more toxic. A proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS has been applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this bioremediation process in P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344. Among others, different proteins related to cyanide and cyanate assimilation, as well as other proteins involved in transport and resistance to metals were induced by the cyanide-containing jewelry residue have been identified.

### Sample Protocol
P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 cells were grown in two 250 mL conical flasks with M9 medium containing 100 mM sodium acetate and 2 mM ammonium chloride. After this nitrogen source was depleted (approximately 24 h), the jewelry wastewater (containing 2 mM cyanide) was added to one of the cultures, whereas 2 mM ammonium chloride was added to a second conical flask as alternative nitrogen source. To carry on with the quantitative LC-MS/MS four biological replicants were set up for each nitrogen source. Cultures were monitored until 50% of the total nitrogen source (cyanide or ammonium) was consumed, and then cells were harvested (at the middle of the log-phase) by centrifugation at 12000  g for 15 min and kept at -80 °C until use. Samples for LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis were prepared by resuspension of frozen cells in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8) containing 4% CHAPS and 8 M urea, then cells were broken by cavitation. Proteins were cleaned with the 2-D Clean-UP Kit (GE Healthcare), after precipitation proteins were resuspended in a solution containing 6 M urea. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) and sample concentration ranged from 2 to 4 µg/µL. Samples were digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C with top-down agitation. All analyses were performed with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) equipped with nanoelectrospray ionization interface (nESI). The separation column was Acclaim Pepmap C18, 150 mm × 0.075 mm, 3µm pore size (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA). For trapping of the digest, it was used a 5 mm × 0.3 mm precolumn Acclaim Pepmap C18 (Agilent Technologies, Germany). One fourth of the total sample volume, corresponding to 5 μL, was trapped at 10 μL/min flow rate, for 5 min, with 2% acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. After that, the trapping column was switched on-line with the separation column and the gradient was started. Peptides were eluted with a 60-min gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid solution at a 300 nL/min flow rate. MS data (Full Scan) were acquired in the positive ion mode over the 400–1500 m/z range. MS/MS data were acquired in dependent scan mode, selecting automatically the five most intense ions for fragmentation, with dynamic exclusion set to on. In all cases, a nESI spray voltage of 1.9 kV was used. Tandem mass spectra were extracted using Thermo ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4, Thermo Scientific). MS2 spectra were searched with SEQUEST engine against a database of P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 (deposited in the EMBL database under the accession number HG916826). Peptides were generated from a tryptic digestion with up to one missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modifications, and oxidation of methionines as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm and product ions were searched at 0.8 Da tolerances. Peptide spectral matches (PSM) were validated using percolator based on q-values at a 1% FDR, calculated against concatenated decoy database. With Proteome Discoverer, peptide identifications were grouped into proteins according to the law of parsimony and filtered to 1% FDR. Proteins were quantified (XIC on the three most intense peptides). For proteins identified from only one peptide, fragmentations were checked manually.

### Publication Abstract
Biological treatments to degrade cyanide are a powerful technology for cyanide removal from industrial wastewaters. It has been previously demonstrated that the alkaliphilic bacterium Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 is able to use free cyanide and several metal-cyanide complexes as the sole nitrogen source. In this work, the strain CECT5344 has been used for detoxification of the different chemical forms of cyanide that are present in alkaline wastewaters from the jewelry industry. This liquid residue also contains large concentrations of metals like iron, copper and zinc, making this wastewater even more toxic. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the bioremediation process, a quantitative proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS has been carried out in P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 cells grown with the jewelry residue as sole nitrogen source. Different proteins related to cyanide and cyanate assimilation, as well as other proteins involved in transport and resistance to metals were induced by the cyanide-containing jewelry residue. GntR-like regulatory proteins were also induced by this industrial residue and mutational analysis revealed that GntR-like regulatory proteins may play a role in the regulation of cyanide assimilation in P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344. The strain CECT5344 has been used in a batch reactor to remove at pH 9 the different forms of cyanide present in industrial wastewaters from the jewelry industry (0.3 g/L, ca. 12 mM total cyanide, including both free cyanide and metal-cyanide complexes). This is the first report describing the biological removal at alkaline pH of such as elevated concentration of cyanide present in a heterogeneous mixture from an industrial source.
