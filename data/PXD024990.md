### Title
Metaproteomic profiling of the intestinal microbiota of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

### Description
Application of a mass spectrometry -based approach to assess the gut microbiota composition and the associated metaproteomic functionality in patients with intestinal COVID-19 infection

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were assigned to taxa using in house scripts using NCBI references, with spectral counts as taxon abundance proxy.

### Publication Abstract
Since the beginning of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has emerged as an important organ influencing the propensity to and potentially the severity of the related COVID-19 disease. However, the contribution of the SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection on COVID-19 pathogenesis remains to be clarified. In this exploratory study, we highlighted a possible link between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gastrointestinal tract, which could be more important than the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, COVID-19 severity and GI symptoms. As established by metaproteomics, altered molecular functions in the microbiota profiles of high SARS-CoV-2 RNA level faeces highlight mechanisms such as inflammation-induced enterocyte damage, increased intestinal permeability and activation of immune response that may contribute to vicious cycles. Uncovering the role of this gut microbiota dysbiosis could drive the investigation of alternative therapeutic strategies to favour the clearance of the virus and potentially mitigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
