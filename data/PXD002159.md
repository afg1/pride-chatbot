### Title
Proteomic analysis of integrin adhesion complex assembly

### Description
To explore the dynamics of integrin adhesion complex assembly, isolated adhesion complexes from K562 cells were subjected to mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis. K562 cells were incubated with FN-coated beads for 1, 7 and 30 minutes and protein complexes stabilised for 2 minutes with DTBP crosslinking reagent before adhesion complexes were isolated.

### Sample Protocol
Integrin adhesion complexes were isolated accordingly to published protocols (Jones et al 2015: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727331). Complexes were analysed by mass spectrometry using in-gel trypsin digestion. Each sample was separated into 30 gel slices for LC-MS/MS and recombined during subsequent data processing.

### Data Protocol
RAW files were processed to peak list files (.mgf) and combined for a single database search using Mascot Daemon. Mascot output files (.dat) were imported to Scaffold and filtered using 90% peptide, 99% protein with at least 2 unique peptides per protein to generate lists of identified proteins.
