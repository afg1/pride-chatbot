### Title
Interactome of the two T. brucei Poly(A) binding protein paralogs PABP1
and PABP2

### Description
Poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA fate by controlling mRNA stability and translation through interactions with both the poly(A) tail and eIF4F complex. Here we identified a protein interaction cohort for both T. brucei PABPs by cryo-mill/affinity purification-mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Procyclic trypanosomes were grown to a density of 5-8 x 106 cells/ml. Four litre cultures were harvested at 1500g at room temperature in four subsequent centrifugations and washed once with 250 ml serum free SDM-79. Finally, the cells were sedimented by centrifugation (1500*g) into a capped 20 ml syringe placed in a 50 ml Falcon tube. After discarding all supernatant, inserting the plunger and removing the cap the cells were passed slowly into liquid nitrogen in order to form small pellets suitable for subsequent cryomilling. Frozen cells were processed by cryomilling into a fine powder in a planetary ball mill (Retsch). For precipitation, aliquots of approximately 50 mg powder (corresponding to ~2 x 108 cells) were mixed with 1 ml ice-cold buffer  (low salt buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 100 µM CaCl2, 0.1% CHAPS; high salt buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 100 µM CaCl2, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% CHAPS) complemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet, EDTA-free, Roche). After sonication with a microtip sonicator (Misonix Utrasonic Processor XL) at setting 4 (~20 W output) for 2 x 1 second, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 g, 10 min, 4°C). The clear lysate was incubated with 3 µl polyclonal anti-GFP llama antibodies covalently coupled to surface-activated Epoxy magnetic beads (Dynabeads M270 Epoxy, ThermoFisher) for two hours on a rotator. Beads were washed three times in the respective buffer (low salt or high salt buffer) and finally incubated in 15 µl 4 x NuPAGE™ LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher), supplemented with 2 mM dithiothreitol, at 72°C for 15 minutes to elute the proteins. The precipitates were analysed on an SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie. For subsequent proteomics analysis six pullout samples were pooled after the final washing step and eluted in 30 µl 4 x NuPAGE™ LDS Sample buffer, then run 1.5 cm into a NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gel (ThermoFisher) under reducing conditions. The respective gel region was sliced out and subjected to tryptic digest and reductive alkylation. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Orbitrap VelosPro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant version 1.5 searching the T. brucei brucei 927 annotated protein database from TriTrypDB. Minimum peptide length was set at six amino acids, isoleucine and leucine were considered indistinguishable and false discovery rates (FDR) of 0.01 were calculated at the levels of peptides, proteins and modification sites based on the number of hits against the reversed sequence database. Ratios were calculated from label-free quantification intensities using only peptides that could be uniquely mapped to a given protein. If the identified peptide sequence set of one protein contained the peptide set of another protein, these two proteins were assigned to the same protein group.

### Publication Abstract
Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA fate by controlling stability and translation through interactions with both the poly(A) tail and eIF4F complex. Many organisms have several paralogs of PABPs and eIF4F complex components and it is likely that different eIF4F/PABP complex combinations regulate distinct sets of mRNAs. Trypanosomes have five eIF4G paralogs, six of eIF4E and two PABPs, PABP1 and PABP2. Under starvation, polysomes dissociate and the majority of mRNAs, most translation initiation factors and PABP2 reversibly localise to starvation stress granules. To understand this more broadly we identified a protein interaction cohort for both T. brucei PABPs by cryo-mill/affinity purification-mass spectrometry. PABP1 very specifically interacts with the previously identified interactors eIF4E4 and eIF4G3 and few others. In contrast PABP2 is promiscuous, with a larger set of interactors including most translation initiation factors and most prominently eIF4G1, with its two partners TbG1-IP and TbG1-IP2. Only RBP23 was specific to PABP1, whilst 14 RNA-binding proteins were exclusively immunoprecipitated with PABP2. Significantly, PABP1 and associated proteins are largely excluded from starvation stress granules, but PABP2 and most interactors translocate to granules on starvation. We suggest that PABP1 regulates a small subpopulation of mainly small-sized mRNAs, as it interacts with a small and distinct set of proteins unable to enter the dominant pathway into starvation stress granules and localises preferentially to a subfraction of small polysomes. By contrast PABP2 likely regulates bulk mRNA translation, as it interacts with a wide range of proteins, enters stress granules and distributes over the full range of polysomes.
