### Title
Mass spectrometry-based proteomic characterization of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase purified from Sinapis alba.

### Description
RNA polymerases (RNAPs) transcribe DNA into RNA and are found in all living organisms with several degrees of complexity from single polypeptide chain to multimeric enzymes. In chloroplast of angiosperms, two RNAPs are involved in plastid gene transcription: the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase (NEP) and the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP). The PEP is a prokaryotic-type multimeric RNAP found in different states depending on light stimuli and cell identity. One of these active states requires the assembly of nuclear-encoded proteins named PEP-Associated Proteins (PAPs) with the catalytic core, triggering the timely transcription of photosynthesis-associated plastid genes in cells acquiring their photosynthetic apparatus. A purification procedure was used to enrich native PEP from Sinapis alba chloroplasts. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the obtained fraction identified the expected subunits, i.e. the core components and the PAPs as the most abundant proteins.

### Sample Protocol
6 to 7-day-old Sinapis alba cotyledons were collected and homogenized using a blender with short pulses (3 × 2-3 s); 100 g approximately of fresh material in 200 mL homogenization buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 0.3 M sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA and 0.3 mM DTT. The suspension obtained was then filtered through muslin and centrifuged 3 min at 6084.1g at 4°C. The pellet was recovered, resuspended in homogenization buffer and poured in a potter to remove all the chloroplast aggregates. The suspension was then loaded on a linear percoll gradient (35 % percoll, 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 0.3 M sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA and 0.3 mM DTT) and centrifuged 50 min at 4696g, 4°C. The fractions containing the chloroplasts were then pooled, diluted in homogenization buffer and centrifuged 10 min at 4000g, 4°C to remove percoll. The pellet containing the chloroplasts was solubilized in the lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 25 % glycerol (w/v), 10 mM NaF, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 % Triton (w/v) and poured in potter for homogenization. The suspension was then centrifuged 50 min, at 15000g, 4°C and the supernatant frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C before using to purify the PEP. After thawing, the chloroplast lysate was mixed overnight at 4°C with heparin resin equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 % (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 80 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0,1 % (w/v) Triton. The resin was extensively washed with 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 % (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 80 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 % Triton (w/v) before elution over 10 fractions of 1 mL with 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 % (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 % Triton (w/v). The fractions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western-Blot analyses with anti-PAP8 antibodies. The fractions containing PAP8, and therefore the PEP, were pooled, loaded on a 35%-15% glycerol gradient (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 35 to 15 % (w/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01 % (w/v) Triton), and centrifuged at 97083g on a SW55-Ti rotor (Beckmann Coulter) during 16 h at 4°C.  The gradient was then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western-Blot. The fractions containing the PEP were pooled before the last step of purification, or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The pool containing the PEP was mixed overnight with Q-sepharose resin (Amersham) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 % glycerol (w/v), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01 % (w/v) Triton). The complex was eluted using a 0-1 M NaCl gradient. The fractions containing the PEP were pooled and concentrated at 2,000g on a 100-kDa cutoff membrane. The purified PEP was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and keep at -80°C before analyses. Three PEP preparations from independently grown plant batches were analyzed. For this, purified PEP from chloroplasts was solubilized in Laemmli buffer and stacked in the top of a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). After staining with R-250 Coomassie Blue (Biorad), proteins were digested in-gel using trypsin (modified, sequencing purity, Promega). The resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 140-min gradient. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 75 μm x 250 mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch). The MS and MS/MS data were acquired by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.7, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the NCBI database (Sinapis alba strain: S2 GC0560-79 (white mustard) taxonomy, BioProject PRJNA214277, July 2020 download), the Uniprot database (Sinapis alba taxonomy, February 2021 download), a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (human keratins, trypsin, etc.), and the corresponding reversed databases. Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable) and Oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 6 amino acids, peptide score ≥ 25, allowing to reach a false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1% as calculated on peptide-spectrum-match scores by employing the reverse database strategy, and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group). Proline was then used to perform a compilation and grouping of the identified protein groups.

### Publication Abstract
RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are found in all living organisms. In the chloroplasts, the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is a prokaryotic-type multimeric RNAP involved in the selective transcription of the plastid genome. One of its active states requires the assembly of nuclear-encoded PEP-Associated Proteins (PAPs) on the catalytic core, producing a complex of more than 900 kDa, regarded as essential for chloroplast biogenesis. In this study, sequence alignments of the catalytic core subunits across various chloroplasts of the green lineage and prokaryotes combined with structural data show that variations are observed at the surface of the core, whereas internal amino acids associated with the catalytic activity are conserved. A purification procedure compatible with a structural analysis was used to enrich the native PEP from <i>Sinapis alba</i> chloroplasts. A mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis revealed the core components, the PAPs and additional proteins, such as FLN2 and pTAC18. MS coupled with crosslinking (XL-MS) provided the initial structural information in the form of protein clusters, highlighting the relative position of some subunits with the surfaces of their interactions. Using negative stain electron microscopy, the PEP three-dimensional envelope was calculated. Particles classification shows that the protrusions are very well-conserved, offering a framework for the future positioning of all the PAPs. Overall, the results show that PEP-associated proteins are firmly and specifically associated with the catalytic core, giving to the plastid transcriptional complex a singular structure compared to other RNAPs.
