### Title
The sulfonic-containing peptides (at C281) from trypsin-treated Orf1 in H218O.

### Description
Oxidized cysteine residues are highly reactive and can form functional covalent conjugates, of which the allosteric redox switch formed by the lysine-cysteine NOS bridge is an example. Here, we report a non-canonical FAD-dependent enzyme Orf1 that adds a glycine-derived N-formimidoyl group to glycinothricin to form the antibiotic BD-12. X-ray crystallography was used to investigate this complex enzymatic process, which showed Orf1 has two substrate-binding sites that sit 13.5 Å apart unlike canonical FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. One site could accommodate glycine and the other glycinothricin or glycylthricin. Moreover, an intermediate-enzyme adduct with a NOS-covalent linkage was observed in the later site, where it acts as a two-scissile-bond linkage facilitating nucleophilic addition and cofactor-free decarboxylation. The chain length of nucleophilic acceptors vies with bond cleavage sites at either N–O or O–S accounting for N-formimidoylation or N-iminoacetylation. The resultant product is no longer sensitive to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, a strategy that antibiotic-producing species employ to counter drug resistance in competing species.

### Sample Protocol
Orf1 (45 M) was incubated in the presence of 2.5 mM glycine and 5 mM compound 4 or 7 at 37°C for 1 hour in 92.2% (v/v) H218O. The reaction solution was exchanged to a buffer solution containing 25 mM NH4HCO3 with 5 g l-1 trypsin. After 24 hours incubation at 37°C, the sample (2 g l-1) was injected to LC-ESI-MS.

### Data Protocol
The Byonic software 4.2.10 (protein metric) was used for peptide identification. The search parameter was set as: precursor mass tolerance ~20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ~20 ppm, maximum missed cleavages ~5, and cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.021464), oxidation (+15.994915), dimedone adduct (+138.068068) and methionine oxidation (+15.994915) with target protein database.
