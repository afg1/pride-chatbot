### Title
AKT isoform specific signaling

### Description
Phosphoproteome analysis of HL-1 cardiomyocytes carrying AKT1 or AKT2 isoform specific knock down, respectively. Six biological replicates were analysed. Cells were grown until reaching 90 % confluency, starved for 50 minutes followed by stimulation with 200 nM insulin for 10 minutes. In solution stable isotope dimethyl labeling was performed following the protocol of Boersema et al. (2009) Nat. Protoc. 4, 484-494 Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Peptides were desalted with Graphite Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific) and fractionated by automated off-line 2-D LC. First dimension: 1 mm × 15 cm Polysulfoethyl-Aspartamide column (Dionex, Thermo Scientific). Two replicates were alternatively fractionated in-solution using the Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator (24 cm IPG strips pH 3-10 (GE Healthcare) and a 24 well frame set from Agilent Technologies). Peptides from the single SCX fractions were further separated and analyzed by reversed-phase nano-LC-MS/MS. Sequence database-search of the MS data was performed against the uniprot mouse database (downloaded 13.06.2012)  using MaxQuant (Version 1.3.0.5).

### Publication Abstract
The protein kinase AKT is a central kinase in the heart and has a major impact on growth/hypertrophy, survival/apoptosis, and metabolism. To gain more insight into AKT isoform-specific signaling at the molecular level, we investigated the phosphoproteome of HL-1 cardiomyocytes carrying AKT1 or AKT2 isoform-specific knock down, respectively. We combined stable isotope labeling with high resolution mass spectrometry and identified 377 regulated phosphopeptides. Although AKT1 is expressed at 4-fold higher levels, insulin stimulation mainly activated AKT2, which might in part rely on a preferred interaction of AKT2 with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2. In line with this result, the highest number of regulated phosphopeptides was identified in the AKT2 knock down cells. Isoform-specific regulation of AKT targets not previously described could be observed, and specific regulation of indirect target sites allows a deeper insight into affected biological processes. In the myocardial context, we identified many phosphosites supporting a connection of AKT to excitation-contraction coupling. Phosphoproteins identified included L-type calcium channel, ryanodine receptor, junctophilin, histidine-rich calcium binding protein, phospholamban, heat shock protein beta-6, and Ca&#xb2;&#x207a;/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. In conclusion, AKT isoform-specific knock down combined with quantitative phosphoproteomics provided a powerful strategy to unravel AKT isoform-specific signaling.
