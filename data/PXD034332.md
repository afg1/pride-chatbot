### Title
SARS-CoV-2 QTQTN motif mutant PTM-peptide mapping

### Description
3 strains of SARS-CoV-2 were created to the function of the QTQTN motif adjacent to the Furin cleavage site on Spike protein: WT (QTQTN), Mutant 1 (QTQVN), Mutant 2 (QVQVN).

### Sample Protocol
Virions were sucrosee gradient-purified from cultured Vero E6 cells. Samples were prepared using either trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion and raw MS/MS sprectra were acquired using either stepped collision energy HCD or EThcD fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were searched with Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software. Peptides were ideentified using Byonic, searching for dynamic modifieications of phosphorylation, N-glycosylation (182 possible forms), or O-glycosylation (70 possible forms). Minora was used to provide label free quantation to calculate the relative abundances of peptide isoforms. Specific mutant samples were searched using databases containing only the respective Spike protein sequence as well as a list of common protein contaminant seequences.
