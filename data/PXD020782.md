### Title
Exercise Proteomics LPC mouse models

### Description
Exercise has the potential to significantly impact those suffering from autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) do not engage in sufficient activity due to barriers such as increased fatigue, reduced mobility and disability. Characterizing the potential molecular benefits for acute exercise is critical for understanding its therapeutic effects on inflammatory lesions. Investigating the effects of exercise on the central nervous system (CNS) will help in guiding future design and implementation of programs to maximize the benefits of exercise for PwMS.

### Sample Protocol
Shotgun proteomics standard protocols. TMT 6-plex was used for labeling after trypsin digestions.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant was used to analyzed the RAW files. STRING-db and Metascape were used for bioinformatics analysis of the enriched pathways.
