### Description
The tandem mass tags (TMT)quantitative proteomics were used for the analysis of protein expression in the maize roots after Holotrichia parallela larvae attacked

### Sample Protocol
For the proteomics analysis of maize seedlings, plants were either infested with one third-instar H. parallela larvae or left herbivore free. After 24h of infestation, the herbivores were gently removed and the plants were harvested.The method of protein extraction was used TCA/aceton. the protein from each sample was digested with trypsin (Promega, USA) at a protein/ trypsin ratio of 40:1 overnight at 37 Â°C. The peptides were labeled using TMT six-plex isobaric label reagent.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS raw data were searched using Mascot engine embedded into Proteome Discoverer 1.4.The main Mascot search parameters were as follows: Carbamidomethyl (C), TMT6/10plex (N-term), TMT6/10plex (K) as fixed modifications, and Oxidation (M) as variable modifications. 20ppm of the peptide mass tolerance and 0.1Da of the fragment mass tolerance was allowed.
