### Title
CL-MS OF hE1a (DHTKD1) or G729R hE1a with hE2o

### Description
CL-MS OF hE1a (DHTKD1) or G729R hE1a with hE2o to identify the possible difference in the interactions between hE1a-hE2o and G729R hE1a-hE2o

### Sample Protocol
1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI, Sigma) linkers was used for cross-linking of the hE1a (wildtype and G729R E1a) and hE2o proteins. The hE1a (or G729R hE1a, 1 nmol, 33 µM subunits) was mixed with hE2o (1 nmol, 33 µM subunits) in 15µl of 20 mM K2HPO4 (pH 7.5)  reaction buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM ThDP, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol. After incubating for 30 minutes at 20 °C, 1 µl of 1 M CDI stock solution in DMSO was added.  The cross-linked samples were digested by trypsin and glu-c, followed by SCX enrichment. The digested sample were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS peak lists were generated using the ProteoWizard 3.0.18156 and searched against the Swissprot database (proteome ID: UP000000558, search was done by using searchGUI-3.3.117 incorporated with peptideshaker 1.16.42).Cross-links were evaluated using software tool Merox 1.6.6 with the following parameters: precursor 5 ppm; fragment 15 ppm mass accuracy; CDI or BuUrBu set as cross-linker. The cross-linked peptides were manually validated, the results with FDR < 0.01 limit were exported.

### Publication Abstract
2-Oxoadipate dehydrogenase (E1a, also known as DHTKD1, dehydrogenase E1, and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) is a thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme and part of the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc) in l-lysine catabolism. Genetic findings have linked mutations in the <i>DHTKD1</i> gene to several metabolic disorders. These include &#x3b1;-aminoadipic and &#x3b1;-ketoadipic aciduria (AMOXAD), a rare disorder of l-lysine, l-hydroxylysine, and l-tryptophan catabolism, associated with clinical presentations such as developmental delay, mild-to-severe intellectual disability, ataxia, epilepsy, and behavioral disorders that cannot currently be managed by available treatments. A heterozygous missense mutation, c.2185G&#x2192;A (p.G729R), in <i>DHTKD1</i> has been identified in most AMOXAD cases. Here, we report that the G729R E1a variant when assembled into OADHc <i>in vitro</i> displays a 50-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for NADH production and a significantly reduced rate of glutaryl-CoA production by dihydrolipoamide succinyl-transferase (E2o). However, the G729R E1a substitution did not affect any of the three side-reactions associated solely with G729R E1a, prompting us to determine the structure-function effects of this mutation. A multipronged systematic analysis of the reaction rates in the OADHc pathway, supplemented with results from chemical cross-linking and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS, revealed that the c.2185G&#x2192;A <i>DHTKD1</i> mutation affects E1a-E2o assembly, leading to impaired channeling of OADHc intermediates. Cross-linking between the C-terminal region of both E1a and G729R E1a with the E2o lipoyl and core domains suggested that correct positioning of the C-terminal E1a region is essential for the intermediate channeling. These findings may inform the development of interventions to counter the effects of pathogenic <i>DHTKD1</i> mutations.
