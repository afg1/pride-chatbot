### Title
Identifiation of salivary proteins in Riptortus pedestris

### Description
In this study, we tried to reveal the protein components of Riptortus pedestris saliva using LC-MS/MS mehods. The Riptortus pedestris strain was reared on clover seeds. The insects were maintained at 26 ± 0.5 °C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity under a light/dark photoperiod of 16/8 h.

### Sample Protocol
The saliva samples were homogenized in lysis solution containing 1% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), then boiled for 10 min. Shotgun-based proteomic analysis was performed via the custom service of Novogene Institute (Novogene, Beijing, China) as previously described.

### Data Protocol
The output raw data were preceded for potential HTSP sequences searching using the software MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 with default parameters: tolerance of one missed cleavages of trypsin, carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term). The identifications were filtered to 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at peptide-spectrum match (PSM) level.
