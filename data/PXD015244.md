### Title
Acyldepsipeptide probes facilitate specific detection of caseinolytic protease P independent of its oligomeric and activity state

### Description
Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) is a tetradecameric peptidase which assembles with chaperones such as ClpX to gain proteolytic activity. Acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) represent small molecule mimics of ClpX, which bind into hydrophobic pockets on the apical site of the complex and thereby induce activation of ClpP. Detection of ClpP has so far been facilitated with active site directed probes which depend on the activity and oligomeric state of the complex. In order to expand the scope of ClpP labeling, we here introduce a stepwise synthetic approach to customized ADEP photoprobes. Structure-activity relationship studies with small fragments and ADEP derivatives paired with modeling studies revealed design principles of suitable probe molecules. The derivatives were tested for activation of ClpP and subsequently applied in labeling studies of the wild type peptidase as well as enzymes bearing mutations at the active site and an oligomerization sensor. Satisfyingly, the ADEP photoprobes provided a labeling readout of ClpP independent of its activity and oligomeric state.

### Sample Protocol
Bacteria were grown in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. 50 mL BHB medium were inoculated with 0.5 mL overnight culture and the bacteria were grown until they reach stationary phase. Cultures were collected in a 50 mL falcon tube and centrifuged at 6000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was disposed and the pellet was washed with PBS and then resuspended in PBS to get a suspension with OD600 = 40. To 990 µL of this suspension 10 µL of photoprobe (1 mM BH266/BH288 in DMSO) or DMSO was added and the tube was briefly mixed by vortexing. After 1 h incubation at r.t. in the dark, the suspension was diluted with 1 mL PBS, transferred into culture dishes and irradiated with UV light (365 nm) for 14 min. The irradiated suspension was transferred to 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and after centrifugation (6000×g, 10 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was removed, the pellets were washed with 1 mL PBS and stored over night at -80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL PBS (4 °C), lysostaphin (5 µL, 10 mg/mL) was added and shaken at 37 °C at 14000 rpm for 1 h. After the addition of SDS (20 µL 20% in PBS, final concentration 0.4%) the suspension was sonicated (10 sec, 20% intensity). The lysate was centrifuged at 17000 ×g for 60 min at r.t. and the supernatant was used for further workflow. Protein concentration was adjusted with a BCA assay. In a 15 mL falcon tube, 500 µL of solution were treated with 43 µL click reagent mix: 3 µL Biotin-PEG3-N3 (10 mM in DMSO), 10 µL TCEP (50 mM in ddH2O), 30 µL TBTA ligand (1.667 mM in 80% t-BuOH and 20% DMSO). The samples were mixed by vortexing, 10 µL CuSO4 solution (50 mM in ddH2O) were added to start the click reaction, the samples were mixed by vortexing again and incubated for 1 h at r.t. in the dark.  Subsequently 4 mL of -80°C acetone were added and proteins were precipitated overnight at -20 °C. Proteins were thawed on ice, pelletized (16900×g, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was disposed and proteins were washed twice with 0.5 or 1 mL cold methanol (-80 °C, MS grade). Resuspension was achieved by sonication (10 sec at 10% intensity) and proteins were pelletized via centrifugation (16900×g, 10 min, 4 °C). After the washing steps the supernatant was disposed and the pellet resuspended in 500 µL 0.2% or 0.4% SDS in PBS at r.t. by sonication (10 sec at 10% intensity).  50 µL avidin-agarose beads were prepared by washing three times with 1 mL 0.2% (w/v) SDS in PBS. All centrifugation steps were conducted at 400×g for 2 min at room temperature. 500 µL protein solution was added to the washed avidin-agarose beads and incubated under continuous inverting (1 h, r.t.). Beads were washed three times with 1 mL 0.2% SDS in PBS and five times with 1 mL PBS.  The beads were resuspended in 200 µL denaturation buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5). TCEP (500 mM, 2 µL) was added and incubated in a thermoshaker (600 rpm, 60 min, 37 °C). Then 2-Iodoacetamide (IAA, 500 mM, 2 µL) was added, the tubes were mixed by vortexing shortly and incubated in a thermoshaker (600 rpm, 30 min, r.t., in the dark). Remaining IAA was quenched by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT, 500 mM, 4 µL). The tubes were shortly mixed by vortexing and incubated in a thermoshaker (600 rpm, 30 min, r.t.). LysC (0.5 µg/µL) was thawed on ice and 1 µL was added and incubated in a thermoshaker (600 rpm, 2 h, r.t., in the dark). TEAB solution (600 µL, 50 mM) and then trypsin (1.5 µL, 0.5 µg/µL in 50 mM acetic acid) were added and incubated in a thermoshaker (600 rpm, 15 h, 37 °C). Digest was stopped by adding 10 µL formic acid (FA) and vortexing. After centrifugation (16616×g, 3 min, r.t.) the supernatant was transferred to a new Protein LoBind Eppendorf tube.  50 mg SepPak C18 columns were equilibrated by gravity flow with 1 mL acetonitrile, 1 mL elution buffer (80% ACN, 0.5% FA) and 3×1 mL 0.1% TFA aq. solution. Subsequently the samples were loaded by gravity flow, washed with 3×1 mL 0.1% TFA aq. solution and 0.5 mL 0.5% FA aq. solution. Elution of proteins was performed by the addition of 750 µL elution buffer. The eluates were lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in 30 µL 1% FA. 0.22 µm centrifugal filter units were equilibrated with 300 µL 1% FA (16616×g, 1 min, r.t.) and samples were filtered (centrifugation: 16200×g, 2 min, r.t.).  Samples were analyzed via HPLC-MS/MS using an UltiMate 3000 nano HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, California, USA) equipped with Acclaim C18 PepMap100 75 µm ID × 2 cm trap and EASY-SPRAY RSLC C18 50 cm × 75 µm separation columns coupled to Thermo Fischer Q Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). Samples were loaded on the trap and washed for 7 min with 0.1% TFA (at 5 µL/min), then transferred to the analytical column and separated using a, 115 min gradient from 5% to 32% MeCN followed by 10 min at 90% MeCN in 0.1% FA (at 300 nL/min flow rate). Fragments were generated using HCD and detected in the ion trap at a rapid scan rate.

### Data Protocol
Peptide and protein identifications were performed using MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 software with Andromeda as search engine using following parameters: Carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed and oxidation of methionine as well as acetylation of N-termini as dynamic modifications, trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme, 4.5 ppm for precursor mass tolerance (main search ppm) and 0.5 Da for fragment mass tolerance (ITMS MS/MS tolerance). Searches were performed against the Uniprot database for S. aureus NCTC8325 (taxon identifier: 93061, downloaded on 10.07.2018). Quantification was performed using label-free quantification (LFQ). The match between runs (default settings) option was used. Identification was done with at least 2 unique peptides and quantification only with unique peptides. Statistical analysis was performed with Perseus 1.6.0.6. LFQ ratios were log2(x) transformed. -log10(p-values) were obtained by a two sample t-test over three biological replicates. Putative contaminants, reverse peptides and peptides only identified by site were deleted. Values were filtered for three in at least one group. Cut off lines were set at -log10 (p-value) of 1.3 and at t-test difference of 3. p- values were corrected by permutation based FDR > 0.5.

To expand the scope of ClpP labeling, we took a stepwise synthetic approach toward customized ADEP photoprobes. Structure-activity relationship studies with small fragments and ADEP derivatives paired with modeling studies revealed the design principles for suitable probe molecules. The derivatives were tested for activation of ClpP and subsequently applied in labeling studies of the wild-type peptidase as well as enzymes bearing mutations at the active site and an oligomerization sensor. Satisfyingly, the ADEP photoprobes provided a labeling readout of ClpP independent of its activity and oligomeric state.
