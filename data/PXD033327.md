### Title
Candida non-albicans biofilm-derived extracellular vesicles

### Description
Currently, non-albicans Candida species, including C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis, are becoming an increasing epidemiological threat, predominantly due to the distinct collection of virulence mechanisms, as well as emerging resistance to the antifungal drugs typically used in the treatment of candidiasis. They can produce biofilms that release extracellular vesicles (EVs) â€’ nanometric spherical structures surrounded by a lipid bilayer, transporting diversified biologically active cargo, that may be involved in intercellular communication, biofilm matrix production, and interaction with host.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were prepared using paramagnetic bead technology based on the Single-Pot Solid-Phase-Enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3), reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with Trypsin/Lys-C Mix.

### Data Protocol
The NCBI database (release April 2022) was used with the following taxonomy restriction: Candida glabrata (25798 sequences). The following parameters were applied: fixed modification - cysteine carbamidomethylation; variable modifications - methionine oxidation; the peptide mass tolerance - 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance - 20 mmu. Only tryptic peptides with up to one missed cleavage were considered.
