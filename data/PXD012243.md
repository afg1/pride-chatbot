### Title
An advanced strategy for comprehensive profiling of ADP-ribosylation sites using mass spectrometry-based proteomics

### Description
ADP-ribosylation is a widespread post-translational modification (PTM) with crucial functions in many cellular processes. Here, we describe an in-depth ADP-ribosylome using our Af1521-based proteomics methodology for profiling of ADP-ribosylation sites, by systematically assessing complementary proteolytic digestions and precursor fragmentation through application of electron-transfer higher-energy collisional dissociation (EThcD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), respectively. While ETD spectra yielded higher identification scores, EThcD generally proved superior to ETD in identification and localization of ADP-ribosylation sites regardless of protease employed. Notwithstanding, the propensities of complementary proteases and fragmentation methods expanded the detectable repertoire of ADP-ribosylation to an unprecedented depth. This system-wide profiling of the ADP-ribosylome in HeLa cells subjected to DNA damage uncovered >11,000 unique ADP-ribosylated peptides mapping to >7,000 ADP-ribosylation sites, in total modifying over one-third of the human nuclear proteome and highlighting the vast scope of this PTM. High-resolution MS/MS spectra enabled identification of dozens of proteins concomitantly modified by ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation, revealing a considerable degree of crosstalk on histones. ADP-ribosylation was confidently localized to various amino acid residue types, including less abundantly modified residues, with hundreds of ADP-ribosylation sites pinpointed on histidine, arginine, and tyrosine residues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested modification of these specific residue types is directed in a spatial manner, with tyrosine ADP-ribosylation linked to the ribosome, arginine ADP-ribosylation linked to the endoplasmic reticulum, and histidine ADP-ribosylation linked to the mitochondrion.

### Sample Protocol
For the “EThcD energy optimization” experiment, HeLa cells were either left untreated or treated for 10 min with 1 mM H2O2. For the “Main” experiment, all HeLa cells were treated for 10 min with 1 mM H2O2. Experiments were carried out in quadruplicate (n=4). For the “EThcD energy optimization” experiment, cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS, lysed in 6 M guanidine buffer, reduced and alkylated, and subsequently digested with Lys-C and trypsin. For the “Main” experiment, digestion was performed with Lys-C and trypsin, or with Lys-C exclusively. ADP-ribosylated peptides were enriched using the Af1521 macrodomain. Subsequently, “EThcD energy optimization” samples were purified and eluted as single-shot using low-pH StageTips, and “Main” samples were high-pH fractionated on StageTip. All samples were analyzed on 15-cm long analytical columns, with an internal diameter of 75 μm, and packed in-house using ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads (Dr. Maisch). Reversed-phase liquid chromatography was performed using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo). The analytical column was heated to 40 °C, and elution of peptides from the column was achieved by application of gradients with Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and increasing amounts of Buffer B (80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid). The primary gradient ranged from 3% buffer B to 24% buffer B over 50 minutes, followed by an increase to 40% buffer B over 12 minutes to ensure elution of all peptides, followed by a washing block of 18 minutes. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was achieved using a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo). Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, capillary temperature to 275°C, and RF level to 30%. Full scans were performed at a resolution of 60,000, with a scan range of 300 to 1,750 m/z, a maximum injection time of 60 ms, and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 600,000 charges. Precursors were isolated with a width of 1.3 m/z, with an AGC target of 200,000 charges, and precursor fragmentation was accomplished using either electron transfer dissociation (ETD) or electron transfer disassociation with supplemental higher-collisional disassociation (EThcD), using calibrated charge-dependent ETD parameters. For “EThcD energy optimization”, supplemental activation energies of 10, 15, 20, and 25 were used, and a setting of 20 was used for all “Main” experiments. For ETD, Reagent Transmission, IC Transmission, and Reagent Ion Source were all calibrated and evaluated on a weekly basis. Charge-dependent ETD calibration resulted in ETD activation times of 46.42 ms for z=3 precursors, 26.11 ms for z=4 precursors, and 16.71 ms for z=5 precursors. This equates to an ETD Time Constant (τ) of 2.32. Precursors with charge state 3-5 were isolated for MS/MS analysis, and prioritized from charge 3 (highest) to charge 5 (lowest), using the decision tree algorithm. Selected precursors were excluded from repeated sequencing by setting a dynamic exclusion of 48 seconds. MS/MS spectra were measured in the Orbitrap, with a loop count setting of 5, a maximum precursor injection time of 120 ms, and a scan resolution of 60,000.

### Data Protocol
Analysis of the mass spectrometry raw data was performed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.30). For both the “EThcD energy optimization” data search and the “Main” data search, default MaxQuant settings were used, with exceptions outlined below. For generation of the theoretical spectral library, a HUMAN.fasta database was extracted from UniProt on the 10th of July, 2018. N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, phosphorylation (S, T, and Y), and ADP-ribosylation on all amino acid residues known to potentially be modified (C, D, E, H, K, R, S, T, and Y), were included as variable modifications. For analysis of trypsin samples, up to 6 missed cleavages were allowed. For analysis of Lys-C samples, up to 3 missed cleavages were allowed. A maximum allowance of 4 variable modifications per peptide was used. Second peptide search was enabled (default), and matching between runs was enabled with a match time window of 1 minute and an alignment time window of 20 minutes. Modified peptides were filtered to have an Andromeda score of >40 (default), and a delta score of >20. Data was automatically filtered by posterior error probability to achieve a false discovery rate of <1% (default), at the peptide-spectrum match, the protein assignment, and the site-specific levels.
