### Title
PBC DIGE - Analyzing serological differences between AMA positive and negative PBC using DIGE

### Description
Analyzing serological differences between AMA positive and negative PBC using DIGE

### Sample Protocol
High-abundant serum protein were depleted by affinity column, then depleted sera were label with Cy of DIGE. After DIGE analysis, 28 proteins spots were found of statistical different dye intensities and which were identified by MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analyses were performed in a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Database search was performed with MASCOT Daemon search engine 2.2 (Matrix Science) through the Global Protein Server version 3.6 (Applied Biosystems).
