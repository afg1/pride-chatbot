### Title
Effects of SAHA on human gut microbiome

### Description
The human stool samples were collected and processed for in vitro culturing under anaerobic condition using rapidAIM assay with or without SAHA, an lysine deacetylase inhibitor, for evaluating the effects of SAHA on human gut microbiome. Metaproteomics were used to analyze the microbiome composition and functions.

### Sample Protocol
The culture samples were lysed with 4% SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis

### Data Protocol
ass spectrometry data were search against gut microbiome database with a previously published MetaLab software tool.
