### Title
iTRAQ experiment on Clostridium strain BOH3

### Description
This study uses iTRAQ based proteomics approach to understand the cellular metabolic machineries present within the Clostridium strain BOH3 (discovered by our group) which can simultaneously utilise both glucose (six carbon sugar) and xylose (five carbon sugar) to produce butanol and riboflavin.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins extracted from bacterial samples treated under different conditions were labelled with iTRAQ reagents as per the manufacturer's protocol. The labelled protein samples were subjected to 2D-LC separation (RP-RP) and analysed using a 5600 Triple TOF mass analyser.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and relative quantification via iTRAQ were performed with ProteinPilot™ Software 4.5 (AB SCIEX) using the Paragon™ database search algorithm (version 4.5.0.0, 1654) for peptide identification, which was further processed by Pro GroupTM algorithm where isoform-specific quantification was adopted to trace the differences between expressions of various isoforms.
