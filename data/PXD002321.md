### Title
Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes: Drosophila melanogaster

### Description
By combining extensive biochemical fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, we directly examined the composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse animal models. The project has been jointly supervised by Andrew Emili and Edward M. Marcotte.  Project website: http://metazoa.med.utoronto.ca

### Sample Protocol
SL2 cells and embryos were kindly provided by Alexander Brehm (Philipps-University Marburg, Germany). Nuclear extracts of each were generated as previously described. Whole cell extracts were prepared by harvesting cells using centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4째C, removing medium by aspiration, and washing cells twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 7.6, 200 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and PMSF, Aprotinin, Leupeptin and Pepstatin) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 26째C water bath three times to lyse, and the extract clarified at 13000 rpm for 30 min at 4째C, before being aliquoted and snap-frozen at -80 째C for subsequent analysis.The lysates were subjected to ion exchange fractionation using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system.Proteins from the HPLC fractions were precipitated, resuspended and digested in solution with trypsin, dried and re-solubilised before being analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a nanoflow HPLC System (EASY-nLC; Proxeon) coupled to LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher).

### Data Protocol
FASTA file was downloaded as described in the manuscript and processed to retain only the longest sequence for each gene, to simplify orthology mapping between species, as the project was focused on conserved complexes. Samples were searched using 3 search engines: Tide, INSPECT, and MSGFDB and combined to create quantification using MSblender (Kwon, Choi et. al. J. Proteome Research 2011). Tide search output is provided in a form processed for best hits with MSblender; MSGFDB and INSPECT search output is provided directly, when available.

### Publication Abstract
Our analysis examines the conservation of multiprotein complexes among metazoa through use of high resolution biochemical fractionation and precision mass spectrometry applied to soluble cell extracts from 5 representative model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and Homo sapiens. The interaction network obtained from the data was validated globally in 4 distant species (Xenopus laevis, Nematostella vectensis, Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and locally by targeted affinity-purification experiments. Here we provide details of our massive set of supporting biochemical fractionation data available via ProteomeXchange (PXD002319-PXD002328), PPIs via BioGRID (185267); and interaction network projections via (http://metazoa.med.utoronto.ca) made fully accessible to allow further exploration. The datasets here are related to the research article on metazoan macromolecular complexes in Nature [1].
