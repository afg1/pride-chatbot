### Title
RNA-bait dependent pulldown in Clostridium difficile

### Description
RNA-bait dependent pulldown of RBPs in Clostridium difficile

### Sample Protocol
The pull-down was performed using Streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynabeads M-270, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bait RNAs were coupled to the adaptor-biotin-coupled Dynabeads. Lysate was applied to the beads, washed, and eluted with LDS sample buffer, following MS sample analysis.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis of MS for pull-down samples was performed as described above, except hat MaxQuant Version 1.6.2.2 was used and the search against UPS2-spike ins was dismissed. Missing LFQ intensities in the control samples were imputed with values close to the baseline. Imputation was performed with values from a standard normal distribution with a mean of 5% quantile of the combined log10-transformed LFQ intensities and a standard deviation of 0.1. To identify enriched proteins, boxplot outliers were identified in intensity bins of at least 300 proteins. Log2 transformed protein ratios of sample versus control with values outside a 1.5x (significance 1) or 3x (significance 2) interquartile range (IQR), respectively, were considered as significantly enriched.
