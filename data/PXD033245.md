### Title
Meiotic Nuclear Pore Complex Modularity Provides Key Insights into Nuclear Basket Organization

### Description
Using phosphoproteomics and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we report that NPCs nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) undergo two distinct modularity events for the nucleoporins Nup60 and Nup2 during budding yeast meiosis: partial and full nuclear basket detachment.

### Sample Protocol
SK1 wild-type and kinase-dead mutatns yeast strains were grown in to OD 0.8; proteins were extracted by bead beating in 8M urea/AmBic and reduced/alkylated by TCEP/IAA; digestion was performed with trypsin and peptides were C18 cleaned up ("non-enriched" samples); peptides were phospho-enriched on TiO2/Lactic acid and C18 cleaned up ("phospho-enriched" samples); data were acquired in DDA or SWATH mode on TripleTOF 6600 using 1hr gradient

### Data Protocol
DDA files were searched with Comet and Mascot; search results were combined with iProphet and converted to spectral library using spectraST. Transition list included the 5 most intense fragments for each precursor. SWATH files were extracted with openSWATH and re-aligned with TRIC; phospho-peptides were controled for the number of peak clusters detectable per file; final peptide and protein matrices were generated using R
