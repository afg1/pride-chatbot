### Title
Regulation of the stress proteome by SCD1

### Description
Cytotoxic stress activates stress-activated kinases, initiates adaptive mechanisms, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and induces programmed cell death. Fatty acid unsaturation prevents cytotoxic stress but the mechanisms are diffuse. We investigated changes in the proteome of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts upon induction of cytotoxic stress (valinomycin or myrtucommulone A) and SCD1 inhibition (CAY10566) and addressed the potential of PI(18:1/18:1) and PI(16:0/16:0) to compensate for the decrease in SCD1 activity.

### Sample Protocol
Extraction of proteins and lipids for multiomics  NIH-3T3 cells in 25 cm2 flasks were washed trice with ice-cold PBS pH 7.4 (2 ml) and scraped in methanol (500 µl, -20°C) and water (500 µl). Samples were combined with chloroform (500 µl, -20°C) and shaken (1400 cycles/min, 4°C) for20 min. After centrifugation (16,100×g, 4°C, 5 min), polar and non-polar phases as well as the interphase were collected. Polar and non-polar phases were dried under vacuum at room temperature using an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus system (Hamburg, Germany; polar phase: aqueous application mode; non-polar phase: high vapor pressure application mode). The residue of the non-polar phase was dissolved in methanol and subjected to lipidomics analysis. The interphasewas washed with methanol (-20°C) and centrifuged (16,100×g, 4°C, 10 min). The pellet was resuspended in denaturation buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate; 60 µl) and 5-fold diluted in aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM). After sonication (Branson Ultrasonics™ Sonifier Modell 250 CE, Thermo Fisher Scientific, parameters: 1× 10 s, constant duty cycle, output control: 2, room temperature), extracted proteins were quantified using a Pierce Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins (50 µg in 285 µl) were reduced by dithiothreitol (10 mM) at 55°C for 30 min and alkylated by iodoacetamide (20 mM, 30 min) at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped by addition of excess dithiothreitol after 30 min. Samples were diluted, subjected to tryptic digestion (16 h, room temperature, sequencing grade modified trypsin; Promega, Madison, WI), acidified with formic acid (4.6 µl), and centrifuged (5 min, 16,000g, room temperature). Peptides in the supernatant were transferred to Sep-Pak 100 cartridges (30 mg, Waters). After washing with formic acid (1% in water), peptides were eluted with ACN/H2O/formic acid (70/29/1), dried under vacuum, and usedfor proteomics analysis.  Quantitative Proteomics  For LC-MS/MS analysis, the dried tryptic peptides were dissolved in 20 µl 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The samples were injected on a nano-ultra pressure liquid chromatography system (Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano pro flow, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI, nanospray flex ion source) source to an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were loaded (20 µl/min) on a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap cartridge, C18,5 μm, 1 mm × 5 mm, Waters, buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-H2O; buffer B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-H2O) with 5% buffer B. After sample loading, the trapping column was washed for 5 min with 5% buffer B (15 μl/min), and the peptides were eluted (300 nl/min) onto the separation column (nanoE MZ PST CSH, 130 Å, C18 1.7μm, 75 μm × 250 mm, Waters) and separated with a gradient of 5−30% B in 120 min. The spraywas generated from a steel emitter(Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) at a capillary voltage of 1900 V. MS/MS measurements were carried out in data dependent acquisition mode (DDA) using a normalized HCD collision energy of 30% in full speed mode. Every second aMSscan was performed over an m/z range from 350-1600, with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200(maximum injection time = 120 ms, AGC target= 2e5). MS/MS spectra were recorded in the iontrap (rapid scan mode, maximum injection time= 60 ms, maximum AGC target = 1e4, intensity threshold: 1e5, first m/z: 120), a quadrupole isolation width of 1.6 Da and an exclusion time of 60 seconds.

### Data Protocol
Data processing and protein identification  For data analysis, raw files were analyzed with ProteomeDiscoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For peptide and protein identification, the LC-MS/MS were searched with SequesHT against a mouse database (SwissProt, 17,023 entries)and a contaminant database (116 entries). The following parameters were used for the database search: mass tolerance MS1: 6 ppm, mass tolerance MS2: 0.5 Da, fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (Cystein), variablemodification: Oxidation (Methionine), variable modification at protein N-terminus: Acetylation, Methionine loss, Methionine loss + Acetylation.

### Publication Abstract
Cytotoxic stress activates stress-activated kinases, initiates adaptive mechanisms, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and induces programmed cell death. Fatty acid unsaturation, controlled by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)1, prevents cytotoxic stress but the mechanisms are diffuse. Here, we show that 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-myo-inositol) [PI(18:1/18:1)] is a SCD1-derived signaling lipid, which inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, counteracts UPR, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation, and apoptosis, regulates autophagy, and maintains cell morphology and proliferation. SCD1 expression and the cellular PI(18:1/18:1) proportion decrease during the onset of cell death, thereby repressing protein phosphatase 2&#x2009;A and enhancing stress signaling. This counter-regulation applies to mechanistically diverse death-inducing conditions and is found in multiple human and mouse cell lines and tissues of Scd1-defective mice. PI(18:1/18:1) ratios reflect stress tolerance in tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, infection, high-fat diet, and immune aging. Together, PI(18:1/18:1) is a lipokine that links fatty acid unsaturation with stress responses, and its depletion evokes stress signaling.
