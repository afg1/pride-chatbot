### Title
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and human ACE2 protein by LC-MS

### Description
Analysis of deglycosylated N-linked glycopeptides for SARS-Cov-2 S and human ACE2 protein by LC-MS

### Sample Protocol
Deglycosylated N-linked glycopeptides generated by digesting SARS-Cov-2 S and human ACE2 protein using chymotrypsin, AspN, or a combination of trypsin and Glu-C. Following digestion, the proteins were deglycosylated by Endo-H followed by PNGaseF treatment in the presence of 18O water. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer (v1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for database searches with mass tolerance set as 20 ppm for precursors and 0.5 Da for fragments

### Publication Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus uses its highly glycosylated trimeric Spike protein to bind to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) glycoprotein and facilitate host cell entry. We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatics analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein both alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on ACE2 receptor glycosylation. Taken together, these data can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.
