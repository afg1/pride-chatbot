### Title
Effects of the human intestinal bacterium Eggerthella lenta on the liver proteome of gnotobiotic mice.

### Description
In this study, the minimal consortium Oligo-Mouse Microbiota (OMM)12 was used to study the function of Coriobacteriia under defined conditions in gnotobiotic mice. OMM12 mice with or without adding the dominant gut bacterium Eggerthella lenta were fed with diets varying in fat content or supplemented with primary bile acids. Changes in the host liver proteomes were studied using untargeted proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from liver samples were extracted using 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, cOmpleteTM proteaseinhibitor). A paramagnetic bead approach with tandem mass tag (TMT-10plex) labeling was applied for sample preparation. This resulted in two fractions that were analyzed on a nano-UPLC system (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, USA) coupled online to the mass spectrometer (QExactive HF, Thermo Scientific, USA) via a chip-based electrospray ionization source (Nanomate, Advion, USA).

### Data Protocol
The raw data obtained were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.5 and UniprotKB entries (reference proteome, including reviewed and unreviewed entries) of Mus Musculus (November 16, 2021). This workflow resulted in TMT mix-internal fold changes (treatment vs control), which were further analyzed.
