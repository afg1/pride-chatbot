### Title
Plasma Biomarker Profile Altered Through Variable Blood Storage

### Description
A major confounding factor for defining disease-specific molecular signatures is the variation in handling and processing of clinical samples. To address this, we assessed how the plasma proteome and degradome changes when whole blood remains at ambient temperature (AT) following collection and prior to processing.

### Sample Protocol
We obtained EDTA blood samples from n=5 healthy volunteers, and blood tubes remained at AT for 30min, 8h, 24h and 48h prior to centrifugation and isolation of plasma. Tryptic protein digests derived from plasma samples prepared in the above time points were compared by label-free quantitative proteomics.

### Data Protocol
Samples were analysed by label-free quantitation using Progenesis QI for Proteomics. Peptide-spectrum matching was performed using Mascot.
