### Title
Brain Proteomic Atlas of Alcohol Use Disorder in Adult Males

### Description
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic expression in several organs including the brain. Multi-omic analyses of the brain from individuals with AUD to date lack a comprehensive analysis of protein alterations in the multiple brain regions that underlie neuroadaptations occurring in AUD. We performed quantitative proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of human post-mortem tissue from brain regions that play a key role in the development and maintenance of AUD: amygdala (AMG), hippocampus (HIPP), hypothalamus (HYP), nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Brain tissues analyzed were from individuals with AUD (n = 11) and matched controls (n = 16).

### Sample Protocol
Human postmortem, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue samples (fully de-identified) from males with a current diagnosis of AUD, severe (n=11) and matched control individuals  who did not have a diagnosis of AUD (n=16) were obtained from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre (NSWBTRC) at the University of Sydney, Australia. Tissue samples from each of the six brain regions (AMG, HIPP, HYP, NAc, PFC, VTA) were scraped into MicroTubes and samples were incubated in a thermocycler at 99 â�°C for 30 min followed by digestion in a Barocycler 2320EXT (Pressure BioSciences) by cycling between 45 kpsi for 50 seconds and atmospheric pressure for 10 s for 60 cycles at 50 â�°C. Resulting peptide samples were transferred to 0.5 mL tubes, lyophilized and resuspended in triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) and peptide concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equivalent amounts of peptide (10 Âµg) for each sample were labeled with tandem-mass tag (TMT) isobaric labels (TMTpro 16plexâ„¢ Isobaric Label Reagent Set, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pooled samples for each brain region were also generated using each individual sample from the respective groups. Each sample multiplex contained a TMT channel of pooled samples specific for a given brain region of interest, a channel for the pooled sample representing all the brain regions and 14 channels corresponding to 14 individual patient samples. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses of TMTpro16 multiplexes was performed on a nanoflow high-performance LC system (EASY-nLC 1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF-X, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Global protein-level abundances were generated from peptide spectral matches identified by searching the data files against a publicly available, non-redundant human proteome database (www.uniprot.org) using Mascot (Matrix Science), Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and in-house tools.

### Data Protocol
Across the AUD and control groups, there were > 6,000 proteins quantified and, in each of the six brain regions, there were proteins identified with differential expression in AUD compared to controls. The region with the greatest number of differentially expressed proteins was the AMG, followed by the HYP. Pathways associated with differentially expressed proteins between groups (fold-change > 1.5 and LIMMA p < 0.01) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). In the AMG, adrenergic pathway was most significantly enriched and in the HYP, dopaminergic signaling pathways were the most enriched. In addition, the oxytocin pathway was also significantly enriched in the AMG and was predicted to be activated by IPA. Proteins with differential expression in AUD highlight potential therapeutic targets such as oxytocin, CSNK1D (PF-670462), GABAB receptor and may lead to identification of other potential targets. Our results provide insights that improve our understanding of the molecular alterations associated with AUD across brain regions that are associated with the development and maintenance of AUD.

### Publication Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic expression in several organs, including the brain. There has not been a comprehensive analysis of altered protein abundance focusing on the multiple brain regions that undergo neuroadaptations occurring in AUD. We performed a quantitative proteomic analysis using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of human postmortem tissue from brain regions that play key roles in the development and maintenance of AUD, the amygdala (AMG), hippocampus (HIPP), hypothalamus (HYP), nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Brain tissues were from adult males with AUD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) and matched controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16). Across the two groups, there were &gt;6000 proteins quantified with differential protein abundance in AUD compared to controls in each of the six brain regions. The region with the greatest number of differentially expressed proteins was the AMG, followed by the HYP. Pathways associated with differentially expressed proteins between groups (fold change &gt; 1.5 and LIMMA p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). In the AMG, adrenergic, opioid, oxytocin, GABA receptor and cytokine pathways were among the most enriched. In the HYP, dopaminergic signaling pathways were the most enriched. Proteins with differential abundance in AUD highlight potential therapeutic targets such as oxytocin, CSNK1D (PF-670462), GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and opioid receptors and may lead to the identification of other potential targets. These results improve our understanding of the molecular alterations of AUD across brain regions that are associated with the development and maintenance of AUD.
