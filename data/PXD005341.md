### Title
Phaeocystis antarctica CCMP 1871 and CCMP 1374, Ross Sea Phaeocystis bloom,  LC-MSMS

### Description
Phaeocystis antarctica strain 1374, Phaeocystis antarctica strain 1871, grown in iron concentrations of 0nM, 1nM, 3nM, 10nM, 30nM, and 100nM. Ross Sea Phaeocystis bloom sample.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were freeze/thaw cycled with B-PER reagent prior to sonication on ice. Methanol:acetone protein precipitation was performed on supernatant at -20degC overnight. Percipitated protein was purified and trypsin digested using an acrylamide tube gel purification method.

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer 1.4 was used to identify proteins using the translated transcriptomes for P. antarctica strains 1374 and 1871. Scaffold 4.0 generated spectral scores using a protein false discovery rate of 1.0%, minimum peptide score of 2, and 95% peptide probability threshold. The Ross Sea Phaeocystis bloom sample was matched against multiple sequence databases.
