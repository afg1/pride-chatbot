### Title
TBP2/TFIIA complex drives an oocyte-type promoter usage grammar leading to female germ cell specific mRNA and endogenous retroviral element transcription

### Description
The transcriptional machinery involved in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription during oogenesis is not well characterized. In somatic cells, the Pol II general transcription factor, TFIID, containing the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors, is the first to bind gene promoters to nucleate pre-initiation complex formation. During oocyte growth TBP is replaced by TBP2 and Tbp2-/- female mice are sterile. Here, we show that in oocytes TBP2 stably associates with TFIIA but does not assemble into a TFIID-type complex but stabily associates with TFIIA. we demonstrate that in female germ cells the specific TBP2-TFIIA-containing transcription machinery drives transcription from oocyte-specific core promoters, which are different from those occupied by TBP/TFIID in somatic cells.

### Sample Protocol
NIH3T3-II10 and NIH3T3-K2 cells cultured in 15 cm dish were washed twice with 1x PBS, subsequently harvested by scrapping on ice. Harvested cells were centrifuged 1000 rcf at 4°C for 5min and then resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of whole cell extraction buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 2 mM DTT, 20% Glycerol, 400 mM KCl, 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, Roche)). Cell lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice for 3 times, followed by centrifugation at 20817 rcf, at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration was measured by Bradford protein assay. The cell extracts were used directly for immunoprecipitation, gel filtration and western blot, or stored at −80°C. Ovaries collected from P14 CD1 And C57 BL/6J female mice were homogenized in whole cell extraction buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 2 mM DTT, 20% Glycerol, 400 mM KCl, 5x PIC (Roche)). Cell lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice for 3 times, followed by centrifugation at 20817 rcf, at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant extracts were used directly for immunoprecipitations. Ovary extract were incubated with anti-GST, anti-TBP2, anti-TAF7 or anti-TAF10 coated Dynabeads at 4°C overnight. After incubation, beads were washed 3 x 5min at 4°C with 500 mM KCl buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP40, 2 mM DTT, 500 mM KCl and 1x PIC (Roche)], then washed 3 x 5min at 4°C with 100 mM KCl buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP40, 2 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl and 1x ). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.8 and neutralized with 1.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8. Immunoprecipitation performed from whole cell extracts of NIH3T3-II10 and NIH3T3-K2 cells were following the same procedures with sepharose beads. Samples were TCA precipitated, reduced, alkylated and digested with LysC and Trypsin at 37°C overnight. After C18 desalting, samples were analyzed using an Ultimate 3000 nano-RSLC (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, California) coupled in line with a linear trap Quadrupole (LTQ)-Orbitrap ELITE mass spectrometer via a nano-electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific). Peptide mixtures were loaded on a C18 Acclaim PepMap100 trap column (75 μm inner diameter × 2 cm, 3 μm, 100 Å; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3.5 min at 5 μl/min with 2% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid in H2O and then separated on a C18 Accucore nano-column (75 μm inner diameter × 50 cm, 2.6 μm, 150 Å; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 240 minutes linear gradient from 5% to 50% buffer B (A: 0.1% FA in H2O / B: 80% ACN, 0.08% FA in H2O) followed with 10 min at 99% B. The total duration was set to 280 minutes at a flow rate of 200 nL/min.
