### Title
eIF4A2 drives repression of translation at initiation by Ccr4-Not through purine rich motifs in th 5'UTR

### Description
Here we show eIF4A2 is a major effector of the represive miRNA pathway functioning via the Ccr4_Not complex;  through its interaction with the Ccr4-Not complex eIF4A2 represses mRNAs at translation initiation. We show  evidence that native eIF4A2 has similar properties to chemically inhibited eIF4A1. eIF4A2 exerts its  repressive effect by binding purine-rich motifs which are enriched in the 5'UTR directly upstream of the AUG  codon.

### Sample Protocol
Hela lysates were separated by gel filtration and immunopurified, the samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and  stained with coomassie, slices were taken from the gel destained and dried then digested with trypsin overnight at 30 degrees C. Peptides were extracted with 0.2% TFA and 10% acetonitrile and dried in a speedvac.The  samples were dissolved in injection solvent (5% formic acid, 10% acetonitrile and analysed in a Waters Synapt G2S using HDMSe after separation by a Waters nanoAcquity LC system (see manuscript for references).

### Data Protocol
Data was collected in Waters .raw format and processed and searched using Waters against a reviewed reversed  human Swissprot database using Proteinlynx Global Server 3.0. The results were visualised using Scaffold  (Proteome Software, Oregon, USA) and the filters were set to a high stringency to give an FDR of 0.0%, emPAI results were generated using quantitative analyss in Scaffold.
