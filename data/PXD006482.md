### Title
Identification of Missing Proteins in the Phosphoproteome of Kidney Cancer

### Description
Finding missing proteins (MPs) has been one of the critical missions of Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) since 2012, twenty-five research teams from seventeen countries have been trying to search adequate and accurate evidence for MPs through various biochemical strategies. In our previous study, we found that phosphoproteomics is one pleasant means to catch low-abundance and membrane proteins which are phosphorylated. Therefore, we speculate it may be an available approach for MPs detection. In this study, kidney cancer and adjacent tissues were used for phosphoproteomics research, we totally identified 8962 proteins including 6415 phosphoproteins, and 44728 phosphosites, of which 10266 were unreported previously. Interestingly, a total of 75 MPs were found, after rigorous screening and manual checking, 26 MPs were ranked as confident MPs by the verification with the synthesized peptides and a stringent manual check of their MS2 spectra, among which 14 MPs were phosphorylated. Functional analysis for 26 MPs revealed that 16 MPs were found to be membrane proteins, 7 MPs were testis-enriched and 1 MPs were kidney-specific. Therefore we concluded that phosphoproteomics is a promising approach in digging MPs for C-HPP studies.

### Sample Protocol
Protein Extraction and Digestion Kidney tissue samples were grounded in liquid nitrogen and sonicated with lysis buffer (9 M Urea,10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mM NaCl, 50 mM IAA, 5 mM Na4P2O7, 100 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM Sodium glycerophophate, 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA), 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma), 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for every 10 mL of lysis buffer).Then the total lysate was centrifuged at 14,800 rpm for 15 min at 4℃ to remove debris. The evaluation of protein concentration and subsequential in-gel digestion was performed as previously described. Off-Line High-pH HPLC Separation Peptide mixtures were re-suspended in 400 μL Buffer A (5% ACN, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH = 10) and resolved to a Bonna-Agela C18 3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm column on a RIGOL-L3000 HPLC (RIGOL, Beijing, China). Before experiments, the HPLC column was processed by methanol and equilibrated by Buffer B (95% ACN, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH = 10) and Buffer A sequentially. The fractionation gradient was performed as follows: 0%B at 0.1 mL/min for 5 min, 2-10% B for 5 min, 10-27%B for 32 min, 27-31% B for 3 min, 31-39% B for 4 min, 39-50% B for 7 min, 50% to 80% Buffer B in 5 min. The chromatogram was recorded at 214 nm. The total fractions were combined to 12 fractions. All of these 12 fractions were lyophilized immediately, and stored at -80°C before use. Phosphopeptides Enrichment After an off-line high-pH HPLC separation, the phosphopeptides were enriched by a multistep immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) method as previously reported. Namely, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) magnetic agarose beads slurry (IMAC beads, Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany) were used with minor modification. Firstly, 120 μL Ni-NTA magnetic agarose bead slurry were centrifuged at 1000g, discarded the supernatants, and wash the beads 3 times with ddH2O. Then, the beads were processed with 100 mM EDTA (pH = 8.0) and 10 mM FeCl3 for 1 h end-over-end, respectively. After removing excess FeCl3, the beads were washed 3 times with water, equilibration buffer (CH3OH: ACN: 0.01% HAc = 1:1:1), and loading buffer (80% ACN with 0.1% TFA) sequentially. After that, the beads were resuspended in 240 μL loading buffer (80% ACN with 0.1% TFA), and equally packed into 12 pipes containing peptide mixtures, then incubated with loading buffer for 30 min. The non-specific adsorption of peptides were washed with loading buffer 3 times, and the enriched phosphopeptides were eluted with basic elution buffer (ACN: 2.5%NH3•H2O=1:1) twice. The eluted phosphopeptides were immediately acidified with 5% FA /50% ACN and lyophilized for LC–MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The enriched peptides of 12 fractions were eluted at a flow rate of 800 nL/min by a Waters Nano AcquityLC (3 μm, C18 reverse-phase fused-silica) through nonlinear gradient. The elution gradient was as follows: 0-10% B for 8 min, 10-22% B for 30 min, 22-32% B for 17min, 32-80% B for 3 min, 80% B for 2 min (Phase A: 0.1% FA and 2% ACN in ddH2O; Phase B: 0.1% FA in 99.9% ACN). The initial MS spectrum (MS1) was analyzed over a range of m/z 300-1600 with a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set as 1 × 106, and the maximum injection time (MIT) was 150 ms. The subsequent MS spectrum (MS2) was analyzed using data-dependent mode searching for the top 20 intense ions fragmented in the linear ion trap via collision induced dissociation (CID). Ions with charge state from 2+ to 4+ were subjected for screening. For each scan, the AGC was set at 1×104, and the NCE was set at 35, MIT was 25 ms. The dynamic exclusion was set at 35s to suppress repeated peak fragmentation. MS/MS raw files were processed in Proteome Discoverer 2.0(v2.1.21, Matrix Science Mascot) against the neXtProt database (release 2017.02). The parameters set for database searching were as follows: cysteine carbamidomethyl was specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, N-acetylation and phospho (STY) were set as variable modifications. The tolerances of precursor and fragment ions were set at 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. For digestion, trypsin was set as protease with two missed cleavage permitted. Only the proteins satisfying the following criteria were considered: (1) the peptide length ≥7; (2) the FDR ≤ 1% at peptide level; (3) the FDR ≤ 1% at protein level; (4) at least two different peptides (both unique and shared peptides were considered) for protein identification. The peptides were quantified by the peak area in Proteome Discoverer. For protein quantification, only the top 3 unique peptides were used for area calculation. The number of decoy identifications divided by that of target identifications were calculated as the corresponding FDRs of PSM, peptide, and protein.

### Publication Abstract
Identifying missing proteins (MPs) has been one of the critical missions of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Since 2012, over 30 research teams from 17 countries have been trying to search adequate and accurate evidence of MPs through various biochemical strategies. MPs mainly fall into the following classes: (1) low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteins, (2) membrane proteins, (3) proteins that contained various post-translational modifications (PTMs), (4) nucleic acid-associated proteins, (5) low abundance, and (6) unexpressed genes. In this study, kidney cancer and adjacent tissues were used for phosphoproteomics research, and 8962 proteins were identified, including 6415 phosphoproteins, and 44&#x202f;728 phosphosites, of which 10&#x202f;266 were unreported previously. In total, 75 candidate detections were found, including 45 phoshoproteins. GO analysis for these 75 candidate detections revealed that these proteins mainly clustered as membrane proteins and took part in nephron and kidney development. After rigorous screening and manual check, 9 of them were verified with the synthesized peptides. Finally, only one missing protein was confirmed. All mass spectrometry data from this study have been deposited in the PRIDE with identifier PXD006482.
