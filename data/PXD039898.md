### Title
Structure and antigenicity of divergent Henipavirus fusion glycoproteins

### Description
A novel henipavirus (HNV) named Langya virus (LayV) was isolated in human patients in China in August 2022. It is closely related to Mòjiāng virus (MojV) and represents the first instance of HNV zoonosis to humans outside of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra viruses (HeV). Within this work, mass spectrometry glycoproteomic analysis revealed that although the LayV F protein has reduced glycosylation compared to its NiV and HeV counterparts, a unique glycan was identified positioned at the DIII apex, shielding a previously identified site of vulnerability in NiV F.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were expressed in ExpiCHO-S cells and purified using CaptureSelect™ C-Tag Affinty Matrix (Thermofisher). Eluted proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged to Tris buffer using 30K MWCO centrifugal concentrators (Merck Amicon). Proteins were reduced/alkylated and digested with either trypsin, glu-c or chymotrypsin. Aliquots of each sample were deglycosylated with PNGase F. Peptides were desalted and concentrated with C18 ZipTips then analysed by LC-MS/MS using DDA methods on a ZenoTOF 7600 (SCIEX).

### Data Protocol
Glycopeptides were identified using Byonic (Protein Metrics, v.4.3.4) using DDA files from each sample.
