### Title
Genetically divergent Francisella philomiragia associated with septic arthritis, Montevideo, Uruguay

### Description
Identification of proteins by nanoLC-MS/MS from a colony of Francisella philomiragia isolated from pacient.

### Sample Protocol
Tryptic digestion of proteins obtained from a colony, analysis by nanoLC MS/MS using a separation gradient from 4 to 35% of B in 45 minutes (A: 0.1% formic acid; B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile)

### Data Protocol
Database search was performed using Patternlab V (Santos, M.D.M. et al Nat Protoc 7, 1553â€“1578 (2022) .Met Oxidations was included as a variable modification.

### Publication Abstract
Here we report a case of septic arthritis associated with a genetically divergent <i>Francisella philomiragia</i> strain in a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis and Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) in Maldonado, Uruguay. In this study mass spectrometry together with whole-genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore technology allowed for the correct identification of the etiologic agent.
