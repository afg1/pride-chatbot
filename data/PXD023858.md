### Title
Response of the thermoacidophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius to solvent stress

### Description
In this study, we used S. acidocaldarius adapted to two extremes, low pH and high temperature, to study its tolerance and robustness as well as its global cellular response towards organic solvents exemplified by 1-butanol. We were able to identify biofilm formation as primary cellular response to 1-butanol.

### Sample Protocol
Biofilms were cultivated in Petri dishes. Frozen cells of S. acidocaldarius, grown under two different conditions (Biofilm-Control (BF0) and Biofilm-1% (v/v) 1-butanol (BF1)), were washed twice with ice-cold water. Cells were resuspended in protein extraction buffer and lysed using ultrasonic treatment. 100 Âµg protein of the supernatant were used for an iTRAQ analysis with two 8-pex-iTRAQ tags 113 and 115 labelled for BF0 and BF1 respectively.

### Data Protocol
All raw data files from MS analysis were submitted to MaxQuant version 1.5.3.8 for protein identification against S. acidocaldarius database (consisting of 2,222 entries). The quantitaion was done using Perseus 1.5.2.6
