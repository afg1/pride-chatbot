### Title
A core UPS molecular complement implicates unique endocytic compartments at the parasite-host interface in Giardia lamblia – native IP conditions

### Description
Affinity purification and mass spectrometry coupled to microscopy-based subcellular localization and signal correlation quantification techniques were employed to investigate protein complexes of eleven reported unconventionally-secreted putative and confirmed virulence factors of Giardia lamblia, all predicted to be cytosolic.

### Sample Protocol
Protocols for co-immunopreciptation (CoIP) under native conditions were adapted from previous studies (Cernikova et al., 2020; Zumthor et al., 2016). Giardia trophozoites expressing tagged reporter constructs (two independent biological replicates per line) as well as wild-type control WBA were grown in one T-25 flask per line and harvested and resuspended in 5ml PBS and 100µl PMSF 0.1M + 50µl protease inhibitor solution before the samples were sonicated twice for 30 seconds (60 pulses, 4 output control, 40% duty cycle) in the cold. After sonication 250 µl 20% Triton x100 was added and the samples were incubated at 4°C on a rotating shaker for ca. 2h. The samples were then centrifuged and filtered (0.2μm WWPTFE membrane) before the addition of 40ul anti-HA agarose bead slurry (Thermo Fisher) and incubation overnight. Samples were then subject to mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Mass spectrometry was performed for all affinity pulldown beads by the Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (PMSCF) of the University of Bern. In a first step the samples were resuspended in 8M Urea with 50mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 and then reduced at 37°C with DTT 0.1M with 100mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 and alkylated at 37°C in the dark with IAA 0.5M and 100mM Tris-HCl for 30 mins. The so generated slurry was then diluted four times with 20mM Tris-HCl with 2mM CaCl2 before digestion overnight with 100 ng sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The samples were acidified with 1% TFA, then centrifuged for peptide extraction in the supernatant. Three aliquots of 5 μL each were then subjected to nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (EASY-nLC1000 coupled to a QExactive mass spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific). µPrecolumn C18 PepMap100 (5μm, 100 Å, 0.3×5mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) was used to trap the peptides and then they were separated by backflush on a C18 column (3 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm×15 cm, Nikkyo Technos, Tokyo, Japan) by applying a 40-minute gradient of 5% acetonitrile to 40% in water, 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 350 nl/min.  Full Scan was set at a resolution of 70 000, an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 1E06, and a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms. The following settings were applied with the data-dependent method for precursor ion fragmentation: resolution 17,500, AGC of 1E05, maximum ion time of 110 milliseconds, mass isolation window 2 m/z, collision energy 27, under fill ratio 1%, charge exclusion of unassigned and 1+ ions, and peptide match preferred, respectively.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (v. 1.6.14.0) was used for MS data interpretation against a Giardia lamblia database (Giardiadb v. 47) using the default MaxQuant settings. Transgenic lines were compared to wild type samples to be aware of possible contaminants. MS hits were sorted by their abundance according to the intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values. Relative abundance was then calculated from the total iBAQ for each hit (%iBAQ= iBAQ/ΣiBAQ*100). To validate the hits, the replicate/s from each line were intersected and only hits found in both/all the data sets in similar relative abundance were further analysed. The average relative iBAQ was calculated by adding the relative iBAQ values for each hit and dividing them by the number of replicates. Average relative iBAQ was then sorted from highest to lowest.
