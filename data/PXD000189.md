### Title
Searching for Pseudomonas aeruginosa MagD partners

### Description
Opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes a structural homologue of the human alpha2-Macroglobulin protein, a large spectrum protease inhibitor and important player of innate immunity. Delta-MagD and MagD-WT Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were lysed and lysates submitted to co-immunoprecipitation using anti-MagD antibody (2 biological replicates). Immunoprecipitated proteins were in-gel digested and resulting peptides analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Identifications were realised using Mascot and filtered using IRMa software (1% FDR). Results were exported to a relational database (MSIdb) and processed using hEIDI software to identify proteins enriched in MagD-WT samples compared to delta-MagD samples.
