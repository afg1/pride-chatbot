### Title
POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 O-glucosylate multiple EGF repeats in fibrillin-1, -2, and LTBP1 and promote secretion of FBN1

### Description
Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils, which are required for proper development of elastic tissues including heart and lung. Through protein-protein interactions with latent TGF-beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1), microfibrils assist regulation of TGF-beta signaling.  Mutations  within the 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of FBN1 cause autosomal dominant disorders including Marfan Syndrome that disrupt TGF-beta signaling. We recently identified 2 novel protein O-glucosyltransferases, Protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 (POGLUT2) and Protein O-glucosyltransferase 3 (POGLUT3), that modify a few EGF repeats on Notch. Here, using mass spectral analysis, we show that POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 also modify over half of the EGF repeats on FBN1, fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and LTBP1. While most sites are modified by both enzymes, some sites show a preference for either  POGLUT2 or POGLUT3. POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 are homologs of POGLUT1, which stabilizes Notch proteins by addition of O-glucose to Notch EGF repeats. Like POGLUT1, POGLUT2 and 3 can discern a folded versus unfolded EGF repeat, suggesting POGLUT2 and 3 are involved in a protein folding pathway. In vitro secretion assays using recombinant FBN1 revealed reduced FBN1 secretion in POGLUT2 knockout, POGLUT3 knockout, and POGLUT2 and 3 double knockout HEK293T cells compared to wild type. These results illustrate that POGLUT2 and 3 function together to O-glycosylate protein targets, and that these modifications play a role in secretion of target proteins.

### Sample Protocol
15-20 microliters of purified protein was transferred to Protein LoBind tubes. Tubes were placed in speed vacuum for 10-15 minutes to concentrate samples. Proteins were denatured and reduced using 10 microliters of reducing buffer containing 8M Urea, 400mM ammonium bicarbonate, and 10mM TCEP at 50 C for 5 minutes. Alkylation was performed at room temp in the dark with 100mM iodoacetamide in 50mM TrisHCl for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 45 microliters of mass spectral grade water was added to each sample. Trypsin and/or V8 was added without exceeding 500ng of total enzyme per sample. Samples were incubated in 37 C water bath for 4-6 hours. 7 microliters of 5% formic acid was added and samples were sonicated for 20 minutes. Samples were desalted with Millipore C18 Zip Tip Pipette Tips. After elution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid, samples were diluted to an approximate concentration of 10ng/ul, 17% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid. Approximately 10ng of each sample was injected on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with an Easy nano-LC HPLC system with a C18 EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (50 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼m ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ 15 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 30 minute binary gradient solvent system (Solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in water and Solvent B: 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water) with a constant flow of 300nL/min was used. Positive polarity mode was used with a m/z range of 350-2,000 at a resolution of 35,000 and automatic gain control set to 1 x 106. Higher energy collisional dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (HCD-MS/MS) was used on the top 10 precursor ions in each full scan (collision energy set to 27%, 2 x 105 gain control, isolation window m/z 3.0, dynamic exclusion enabled, and 17,500 fragment resolution.

### Data Protocol
PMi-Byonic (v.2.10.5) and Proteome Discoverer (v2.1) were used to identify peptides. Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl +57.021464 at C. Variable modifications: Oxidation +15.994915 at M,H,N,D, Deamidated +0.984016 at N, and Ammonia-loss -17.026549 at NTerm C. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 20ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set to 30ppm. Two missed cleavages were allowed. Protein and peptide false discovery rates were set to a threshold of 1% and calculated in Byonic software version 2.10.5 (Protein Metrics) using the 2-dimensional target decoy strategy as described (48). Xcalibur Qual Browser (v2.0.3) was used to generate EICs for all identified peptides. For each peptide, area under the curve was calculated for each peak corresponding to searched glycoforms. Relative abundance was calculated by comparing area under the curve for a single glycoform to the total area under curve for all searched glycoforms of a specific peptide. Glcyoforms searched: unmodified peptide, unmodified peptide plus beta-hydroxylation, modified peptide with O-hexose, and modified peptide with O-hexose plus beta-hydroxylation.
