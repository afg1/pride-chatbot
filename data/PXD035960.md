### Title
OuMV MP-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis

### Description
Co-immunoprecipitation assays coupled with mass spectrometry identified a series of host factors that could interact with the OuMV MP and link the MP with various pathways including membrane trafficking, lipid binding, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, RNA binding, cell wall biosynthesis, blue light response, calcium signaling, transport across the plasma membrane, protein folding and homeostasis, proteolysis, and metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
OuMV MP-interacting proteins were identified by using purified recombinant MBP-MP as bait to isolate interacting proteins from Arabidopsis leaf extracts and bound proteins were subjected to on-bead trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data were analyzed using ProteinPilot software. Unused Score > 1.3 (95% confidence) was used as a cut-off threshold to identify proteins.
