### Title
Proteomic analysis of E. coli K-12 LE392, P. putida KT2440 under exposure of carbamazepine

### Description
The goals of this study are to use SWATH-MS to detect bacterial proteomic profiles of wild-type E. coli K-12 LE392, P. putida KT2440, and their quantitative protein response under the exposure of antiepileptic drug carbamazepine. Three concentrations of carbamazepine were applied, which were 0.05 mg/L, 10.0 mg/L and 50.0 mg/L. The group without dosing carbamazepine was the control group. Each concentration was conducted in triplicate. By comparing the proteomic profiles of experimental groups and control group, the effects of carbamazepine on bacterial translational levels can be revealed.

### Sample Protocol
5 mL of bacteria E. coli K-12 LE392 (108 cfu/mL) and 5 mL of bacteria P. putida KT2440 (108 cfu/mL) were mixed together, with the dosage of 0.0 mg/L, 0.05 mg/L, 10.0 mg/L and 50.0 mg/L carbamazepine. After 8 hours, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min. Total bacterial protein was extracted from these cell pellets using the B-PER method, followed by reduction, alkylation, digestion and ziptip clean-up procedures. Afterwards, 5 μg aliquot of the purified protein from each triplicate sample were applied for mass spectrometry analysis and for construction of protein libraries by information dependent analysis (IDA). Another 5μg aliquot of the purified protein from each triplicate sample were used for SWATH-MS analysis. Samples were pooled into a Triple-T of 5600 instrument (ABSciex, USA) equipped with a Nanospray III interface.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data from IDA were combined and searched using ProteinPilot software (ABSciex, Forster City CA). The searched databases were the combination of E. coli SP only (received from Uniprot on 15th of October 2017), and P. putida KT2440 (received from NCBI on 15th of October 2017). The search setting for enzyme digestion was set to Trypsin and alkylation was set to iodoacetamide. Afterwards, the constructed IDA library and SWATH-MS data were loaded into PeakView v2.1 for further processing, with the peptide confidence threshold of 99%, number of peptides per protein of 5, and number of transitions per peptide of 3. A minimum of 2 peptides and 3 transitions was used for quantitative analysis. A stringency cut-off of q value less than 0.01 was used to identify the proteins with significant different expression levels. Afterwards, R-based package MSstats was applied to compare the difference of translational levels in each group. 

### Publication Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a severe global threat for public health, causing around 700,000 deaths per year. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the most significant pathways to disseminate antibiotic resistance. It is commonly acknowledged that sub-minimum inhibition concentrations of antibiotics are major contributors in promoting antibiotic resistance through HGT. Pharmaceuticals are occurring in our environments at increased levels, yet little is known whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals cause or accelerate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Here, we report for the first time that the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, promotes conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. It was seen that environmentally relevant concentrations of carbamazepine (e.g., 0.05&#x2009;mg/L) significantly enhanced the conjugative transfer of multiresistance genes carried by plasmid within and across bacterial genera. The underlying mechanisms of the enhanced HGT were revealed by detecting oxidative stress and cell membrane permeability, in combination with MinION DNA sequencing, genome-wide RNA sequencing, and proteomic analysis. Carbamazepine induced a series of acute responses, including increased levels of reactive oxygen species, the SOS response; increased cell membrane permeability, and pilus generation. Expressional levels of genes related to these processes were significantly upregulated during carbamazepine exposure. Given that HGT occurs widely among different species in various environments, these findings are an early warning for a wide assessment of the roles of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in the spread of antibiotic resistance.
