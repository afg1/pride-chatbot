### Title
Community-level interactions support CH4 oxidation in the Saanich Inlet O2-deficient water column

### Description
Enrichments with labeled CH4 and NO2 were conducted to test microbial community correlations and constrain potential metabolic interactions between methanotrophs and other one-carbon utilizing microorganisms under low O2 conditions

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ and abundances inferred using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline

### Publication Abstract
None

### Keywords
Methanotrophs, Proteomics, Oxygen minimum zones, Microbial networks, Methane oxidation
