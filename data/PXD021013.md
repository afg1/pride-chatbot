### Title
ProteomeTools â€“ Part III - HLA Class I & II & non-tryptic peptides

### Description
The ProteomeTools project aims to derive molecular and digital tools from the human proteome to facilitate biomedical and life science research. Here, we describe the third iteration of the generation and multimodal LC-MS/MS analysis of >305,000 synthetic non-tryptic peptides representing HLA Class I & II ligands as well as peptides derived from the N-terminal proteases LysN and ApsN. This resource will be extended to 1.4 million peptides and all data will be made available to the public in ProteomicsDB.

### Sample Protocol
Tryptic peptides were individually synthesized by solid phase synthesis, combined into pools of ~1,000 peptides and measured on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. For each peptide pool, an inclusion list was generated to target peptides for fragmentation in further LC-MS experiments using five fragmentation methods (HCD, CID, ETD, EThCD, ETciD ) with ion trap or Orbitrap readout and HCD spectra were recorded at 6 different collision energies.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS runs were individually anaysed using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30.
