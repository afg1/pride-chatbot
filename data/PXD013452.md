### Title
treatment-naïve type 2 diabetics metaproteomics

### Description
To gain further insights into functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with T2D, we conducted metaproteomic analyses using iTRAQ (isobaric peptide tags for relative and absolute quantification) and LC-MS/MS-based protocols on 84 samples

### Sample Protocol
Processing of peptide extracts for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis included 1) protein extraction and digestion, 2) peptide labelling and 3) peptide fractionation. Peptide labelling was conducted with 8-plex iTRAQ reagents, with a pooled mixture of 4 samples for each tag from I113 to I119. A reference sample with pooled mixture of 112 samples (including additional 28 samples from medicated T2D individuals) was labelled by tag I121 and served as a reference for comparison between the samples from NGT, Pre-DM and TN-T2D individuals. Peptide fractionation was conducted using strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX).

### Data Protocol
A two-step database search based on the MS/MS spectra was applied, first with a Mascot search against human and gut microbial protein sequence databases to yield a set of scored peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), followed by a target-decoy search strategy to control for false positives. Identified microbial proteins went through a clustering process using a parsimony principle to generate a non-redundant set of meta-proteins. Both human proteins and meta-proteins were quantified and functionally annotated. Taxonomic assignment was also carried out on meta-proteins
