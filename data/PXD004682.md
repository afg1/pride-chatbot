### Title
Comparison of Lung Cancer Proteome Profiles 1: Label Free Quantification

### Description
The goal of this project is to compare label free quantification, chemical labeling with tandem mass tags, and data independent acquisition discovery proteomics approaches using lung squamous cell carcinomas and adjacent lung tissues.

### Sample Protocol
Protein Extraction and Digestion Tissue samples were homogenized with a BioPulverizer and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 9 M urea, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM -glycerophosphate. After brief sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 15 ºC for 30 minutes. The proteins were reduced with 4.5 mM DTT at 60 ºC for 20 minutes followed by alkylation with 11 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark. The sample was then diluted 4-fold to a final concentration of 2 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, and trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37 ºC with an enzyme/protein ratio of 1/50.  SepPak C18 Peptide Cleanup The digested peptide solution was acidified with 20% TFA to a final TFA concentration of 1%. After incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes, the solution was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 15 ºC for 15 minutes. The Sep-Pak cartridges were washed with 5 ml acetonitrile followed by 3 ml and 4 ml washes with Sep-Pak solvent A (aqueous 0.1% TFA). After acidified peptides were loaded, the cartridge was washed with 1 ml, 5 ml and 6 ml of Sep-Pak solvent A. Elution was carried out 3 times using 2 ml of Sep-Pak solvent B (aqueous 40% acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA). After freezing, the peptides were lyophilized to dryness over for 2 days. For LF, an aliquot (600 g) of total protein digest was fractionated using basic pH reversed phase HPLC, adapted from the method published by Mertins et al.[31] For TMT, an aliquot (100 g) of total protein digest was labeled for each reporter ion channel, combined and fractionated using basic pH reversed phase HPLC, ibid. For DIA, aliquots (500 ng) of total protein digest were injected for each sample.  bRPLC Separation  Dried peptides were reconstituted in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. The separation was carried out on Dionex Ultimate3000 UPLC using a 2.1 mm ID x 50 mm column packed with XBridge (Waters) C18, 3.5 M particle size at a 0.2 ml/min flow rate. The gradient setting was: 100% bPRLC A (aqueous 2% acetonitrile with 5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) for 9 minutes, then the concentration of bRPLC solvent B (aqueous 90% acetonitrile with 5 mM ammonium formate, pH 10) was increased to 6% over 4 minutes, to 28.5% over 50 minutes, to 34% over 5.5 minutes, and to 60% over 13 min, and then kept constant for 8.5 minutes prior to re-equilibration at the original conditions. Twelve concatenated fractions were collected.  LC-MS/MS Analysis of Label-Free Samples  A nanoflow ultra high performance liquid chromatograph (RSLC, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced with an electrospray quadrupole-orbital ion trap mass spectrometer (QExactive Plus, Thermo, San Jose, CA) was used for tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing experiments. The sample was first loaded onto a pre-column (2 cm x 100 µm ID packed with C18 reversed-phase resin, 5µm particle size, 100Å pore size) and washed for 8 minutes with aqueous 2% acetonitrile and 0.04% TFA. The trapped peptides were eluted onto the analytical column, (C18, 75 µm ID x 50 cm, 2 µm, 100Å, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The 90-minute gradient was programmed as: 95% solvent A (aqueous 2% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) for 8 minutes, solvent B (aqueous 90% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) from 5% to 38.5% in 60 minutes, then from 38.5% to 90% in 7 minutes, and held at 90% for 5 minutes, followed by solvent B from 90% to 5% in 1 minute and re-equilibration for 10 minutes. The flow rate on analytical column was 300 nl/min. Sixteen tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner following each survey scan using 60 second exclusion for previously sampled peptide peaks using normalized collision energy 28. Ten femtomoles of a standard peptide retention time calibration mixture (PRTC, Pierce #88320) was spiked in each LC-MS/MS analysis to monitor instrument performance (Figure S1). LC-MS/MS Analysis of TMT Samples   The same UPLC and mass spectrometry instrument parameters were used as described above except in MS2 where the first mass was set to m/z 100 to include the reporter ions and the normalized collision energy value was set to 30. Twenty-five femtomoles of PTRC was spiked in each LC-MS/MS analysis to monitor instrument performance (Figure S1). DIA Analysis of Label-Free Unfractionated Samples  The same UPLC conditions were used as for the DDA. The mass spectrometry method utilized MS1 scans alternated with looped 18 narrow window DIA scans covering m/z range from 450 to 1,080. The isolation windows from 450 to 900 were set at 5 Th and the isolation windows from 900 to 1,080 were set at 8 Th. Resolution was set at 70,000 for MS1 and 17,500 for MS/MS. Twenty-five femtomoles of PTRC was spiked in each LC-MS/MS analysis to monitor instrument performance (Figure S1).

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant Data Analysis  MaxQuant version 1.5.2.8 was used for the peptide and protein identification from LF and TMT results.[32] Database searches were conducted against human entries in UniProt (downloaded 05/25/2015).  For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).

### Publication Abstract
Discovery proteomics experiments include many options for sample preparation and MS data acquisition, which are capable of creating datasets for quantifying thousands of proteins. To define a strategy that would produce a dataset with sufficient content while optimizing required resources, we compared (1) single-sample LC-MS/MS with data-dependent acquisition to single-sample LC-MS/MS with data-independent acquisition and (2) peptide fractionation with label-free (LF) quantification to peptide fractionation with relative quantification of chemically labeled peptides (sixplex tandem mass tags (TMT)). These strategies were applied to the same set of four frozen lung squamous cell carcinomas and four adjacent tissues, and the overall outcomes of each experiment were assessed. We identified 6656 unique protein groups with LF, 5535 using TMT, 3409 proteins from single-sample analysis with data-independent acquisition, and 2219 proteins from single-sample analysis with data-dependent acquisition. Pathway analysis indicated the number of proteins per pathway was proportional to the total protein identifications from each method, suggesting limited biological bias between experiments. The results suggest the use of single-sample experiments as a rapid tissue assessment tool and digestion quality control or as a technique to maximize output from limited samples and use of TMT or LF quantification as methods for larger amounts of tumor tissue with the selection being driven mainly by instrument time limitations. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD004682, PXD004683, PXD004684, and PXD005733.
