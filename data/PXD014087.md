### Title
Proteomics analysis of pancreatic cancer cell line (MiaPaCa-2)

### Description
Project describes the proteomics analysis using pSILAC approach to identify and quantify the hypoxia induced protein under serum and serum free conditions in pancreatic cancer cell line (MiaPaCa-2)

### Sample Protocol
Cell were lysed and in-solution digestion was performed. Extracted peptides were subjected to fractionation on an XBridgeTM BEH C18 column  and analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Peptides were separated and analysed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled to a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Separation was performed on a Dionex EASY-Spray 75µm×10 cm column packed with PepMap C18 3µm, 100 A˚. Peptides were subsequently analysed using the Q-exactive MS with an EASY nanospray source at an electrospray potential of 1.5kV

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and quantitation were performed by processing the raw data from three replicates using Protein Discoverer (PD) version 2.2 software . The MS/MS spectra were deisotoped and deconvoluted using the MS2 spectrum processor node in PD. Mascot and Sequest HT were used in parallel and the data compared against a protein sequence file from the UniProt human database.For searches using both engines, maximum missed cleavage sites per protein was set at 2, with precursor and fragment ions mass tolerance set at 10ppm and 0.02Da respectively.A protein group list was generated from PD 2.2 software and the list was filtered to exclude contaminating proteins. Only proteins with q-value <0.01 (<1% FDR) as determined by percolator and detected in both replicates were used for further analysis

### Publication Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide due to the difficulty of detecting early-stage disease and our poor understanding of the mediators that drive progression of hypoxic solid tumors. We therefore used a heavy isotope 'pulse/trace' proteomic approach to determine how hypoxia (Hx) alters pancreatic tumor expression of proteins that confer treatment resistance, promote metastasis, and suppress host immunity. Using this method, we identified that hypoxia stress stimulates pancreatic cancer cells to rapidly translate proteins that enhance metastasis (NOTCH2, NCS1, CD151, NUSAP1), treatment resistance (ABCB6), immune suppression (NFIL3, WDR4), angiogenesis (ANGPT4, ERO1&#x3b1;, FOS), alter cell metabolic activity (HK2, ENO2), and mediate growth-promoting cytokine responses (CLK3, ANGPTL4). Database mining confirmed that elevated gene expression of these hypoxia-induced mediators is significantly associated with poor patient survival in various stages of pancreatic cancer. Among these proteins, the oxidoreductase enzyme ERO1&#x3b1; was highly sensitive to induction by hypoxia stress across a range of different pancreatic cancer cell lines and was associated with particularly poor prognosis in human patients. Consistent with these data, genetic deletion of ERO1&#x3b1; substantially reduced growth rates and colony formation by pancreatic cancer cells when assessed in a series of functional assays <i>in vitro</i>. Accordingly, when transferred into a mouse xenograft model, ERO1&#x3b1;-deficient tumor cells exhibited severe growth restriction and negligible disease progression <i>in vivo</i>. Together, these data indicate that ERO1&#x3b1; is potential prognostic biomarker and novel drug target for pancreatic cancer therapy.
