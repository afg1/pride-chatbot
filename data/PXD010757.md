### Title
Proteomics reveals ablation of PlGF down-regulate the insulin resistance pathway, increase antioxidant and neuroprotective proteins in the diabetic mice retina

### Description
PGF (Placental growth factor) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sub-family a crucial factor in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Mechanisms by which PlGF expression is regulated remain to be investigated in diabetic retinopathy DR. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that PlGF, mediates in the early complications at non-proliferative DR remain mostly elusive. Here we have applied an LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantification proteomic approach to PlGF ablation in the retinal tissues from mouse strains (Akita, PlGF-/- and Akita.PlGF-/-). The proteomes of retinal tissues were extracted, digested by the Trypsin/LysC enzyme and subsequently analyzed by a Q-Exactive hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We have performed normalization by the Z-score method, correlation by Pearson correlation coefficient and identified differentially expressed proteins in four comparisons. The gene ontology, functional pathways, and protein-protein network interaction analysis suggested that Gnb1, Gnb2, Gnb4, Gnai2, Gnao1, Snap2 and Gngt1 proteins are involved in insulin resistance pathways, which are down-regulated/ no significant in PlGF ablation in Akita diabetics (Akita.PlGF-/- vs. Akita), up-regulated in Akita vs. C57, PlGF-/- vs. C57. Prdx6, Map2 are involved in antioxidant activity and neural protection pathways respectively, which are up-regulated in Akita.PlGF-/- vs. Akita. Our proteomics outcomes anticipated that down-regulated of insulin resistance pathways, up-regulation of antioxidant and neuroprotection proteins might epitomize the potential mechanisms of anti-PlGF therapies in the treatment of DR.

### Sample Protocol
Mouse Strains C57BL/6-Ins2<Akita>/J.PlGF-/-, C57BL/6-PlGF-/-, C57BL/6-Ins2<Akita>/J, and C57BL/6J (C57) were generated and Akita mice were crossed with PlGFâˆ’/âˆ’ mice37 in a C57BL/6J background for two generations to give birth to the progeny with the genotype of Akita.PlGFâˆ’/âˆ’. Final blood glucose concentration and body weight were measured before sacrifice. Mice were euthanized by ketamine overdose (100 mg/kg), intraperitoneal injection treatment. Mouse eyes were enucleated, and retinas were carefully isolated free of the cornea, lens, vitreous humor and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on ice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1M, pH=7.2) under the dissection microscope Stemi 2000-C (Zeiss). Retinas were frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80â„ƒ until further use. Retinas were homogenized using RIPA buffer (R0278-50ML; Sigma) supplemented with protease and phosphates inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signalling Technology). Retinal homogenates were centrifuged (12,000g, 4Â°C, and 10min) to remove tissue debris. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#: 23225); 50-microgram of total protein from each sample was used for peptide preparation. DTT reduced proteins and alkylated by iodoacetamide (10mM, in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) at room temperature for 1h. The protein samples were then digested with trypsin/LysC (Promega, Cat#: V5073) in 25mM ammonium bicarbonate solution at 37Â°C for 12 h. The resultant peptides were washed and desalted with the desalting column (Pierce Spin-Tip) and eluted with 50Âµl 5% acetonitrile + 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides mixtures were run through the ziptip C18 (Millipore) and then dried with SpeedVac concentrator. The LC/MS/MS analysis of samples was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer and Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Poolchon Scientific, Frederick, MD, USA). Peptide mixtures from each sample were loaded onto a peptide trap cartridge at a flow rate of 5 Î¼L/min. The trapped peptides were eluted onto a reversed-phase PicoFrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (3-36%) in 0.1% formic acid. The elution duration was 120 min at a flow rate of 0.3 Î¼l/min. Eluted peptides from the PicoFrit column were ionized and sprayed into the mass spectrometer, using a Nanospray Flex Ion Source ES071 (Thermo) under the following settings: spray voltage, 1.6 kV, Capillary temperature, 250Â°C.

### Data Protocol
The LTQ-Orbitrap peptides were identified (main search peptide search = 4.5 ppm and 20 ppm for first search peptide tolerance, respectively) from the MS/MS spectra searched against Mus musculus UniProtKB (83,598 entries) target database using Andromeda search engine. This target database was also shared with the common contaminants and concatenated with the reversed versions of all sequences. In group-specific parameters, enzyme-specific was set to trypsin, and two missed cleavages were allowable; variable modifications were selected as fixed modification whereas carbamidomethylation (C) and oxidization (M) were set as fixed and variable modifications respectively were selected as variable modifications and set to a maximum number of modifications per peptide. The MaxQuant software generated output file â€œproteingroups.txtâ€� was utilized for Pearson correlation, clustering and statistical analysis using Perseus software version 1.6.1.1. Unverified hierarchical clustering of the LFQ values was carried out based on Euclidean distances on the Z-scored among mean values. For statistical analysis, two-samples t-test-based statistics with P < 0.05 was applied on Log2 transformed LFQ values and the minimum number of values â€œin at least one groupâ€� is 3 to assert proteins regulation as significant for the specific groups

### Publication Abstract
Placental growth factor (PlGF or PGF), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sub-family, plays a&#xa0;crucial role in pathological angiogenesis and inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that PlGF mediates regarding the complications of non-proliferative&#xa0;diabetic retinopathy (DR) remain elusive. Using an LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantification proteomic approach we characterized the alterations in protein expression caused by PlGF ablation in the retinas obtained from C57BL6, Akita, PlGF<sup>-/-</sup> and Akita.PlGF<sup>-/-</sup> mice. After extraction and enzymatic digestion with Trypsin/LysC, the retinal proteins were analyzed by Q-Exactive hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins&#xa0;(DEPs) were identified in four comparisons based on Z-score normalization and reproducibility by Pearson's correlation coefficient. The gene ontology&#xa0;(GO), functional pathways, and protein-protein network interaction analysis suggested that several proteins involved in insulin resistance pathways (Gnb1, Gnb2, Gnb4, Gnai2, Gnao1, Snap2, and Gngt1) were significantly down-regulated in PlGF ablated Akita diabetic mice (Akita.PlGF<sup>-/-</sup> vs. Akita) but up-regulated in Akita vs. C57 and PlGF<sup>-/-</sup> vs. C57 conditions. Two proteins involved in the antioxidant activity and neural protection pathways, Prdx6 and Map2 respectively, were up-regulated in the Akita.PlGF<sup>-/-</sup> vs. Akita condition. Overall, we predict that down-regulation of proteins essential for insulin resistance, together with the up-regulation of antioxidant and neuroprotection proteins highlight and epitomize the potential mechanisms important for future anti-PlGF therapies in the treatment of DR.
