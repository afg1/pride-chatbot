### Title
Human HCC sample, phosphosites occupancy

### Description
Improve the reliability of the phosphosite occupancy determined by the third method by comparison of the ratio of absolute occupancy and relative occupancy from HCC samples. An outlier score was introduced to evaluate the deviation between ratio of absolute occupancy and relative occupancy and further to balance the confidence interval and deviation instead of set a fixed threshold.

### Sample Protocol
The powdered tissues were solubilized in GdmCl lysis buffer (6M GdmCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM CAA) and heated for 5 min 95Â°C FASP digest Phosphopeptides were enriched with immobilized titanium (IV) ion affinity chromatography (Ti4+-IMAC) from digest Offline High pH Reverse-Phase HPLC Fractionation

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant9 (version 1.6.2.10) software using the integrated Andromeda search engine with FDR < 0.01 at the protein, peptide and modification level Fixed modifications for carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications for phospho (STY), oxidized methionine (M) and acetylation (protein N-term)
