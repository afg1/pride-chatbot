### Title
Characterization of METTL9-mediated methylation of DNAJB12

### Description
The analysis is part of a study aimed at characterizing a new human histidine-specific methyltransferase denoted METTL9. The putative METTL9 substrate DNAJB12 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells and its PTM status was assessed by LC-MSMS.

### Sample Protocol
HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM and DNAJB12 was immunoprecipitated with commercially available antibodies. IP material was separated by SDS-PAGE whereafter the relevant regions were exercises and processes for LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
All raw MS files were analyzed with Max-Quant (version 1.6.0.17) (pmid19029910) and searched against a database composed of the canonical isoforms of human proteins as downloaded from Uniprot in April 2017 (Uniprot Complete proteome: UP_2017_04/Human/UP000005640_9606.fasta) using the default setting with few exceptions. Methylation of lysine (mono, di and tri), arginine (mono and di) and histidine (mono) were set as variable modifications and missed cleavages were restricted to one.
