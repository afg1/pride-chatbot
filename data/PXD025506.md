### Title
T Cell differentiation Phosphoproteomic experiment

### Description
D10 T cells were treated with a variety of conditions to determine rapid changes in the phosphoproteome as cells begin differentiating

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed then cleaned and digested using S-trap method, enriched for phosphopeptides using Agilent Fe-NTA columns, desalted on C18 and run on QExactive instruments

### Data Protocol
data was processed using PEAKS-X using ST phosphorylation as a variable modification
