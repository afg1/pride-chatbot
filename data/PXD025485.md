### Title
Proteomic study of fig fruit latex

### Description
Scalpels were used to cut through the fig peel at the maturity transition stage. The latex flowed out from the wound was collected into centrifuge tubes and froze using liquid nitrogen, then stored in an ultra-low temperature refrigerator until used for protein identification.

### Sample Protocol
The tris-phenol method (Xie et al., 2009) was used to extract latex protein. A 2-D Quant-kit was used to quantify the protein, and 20 Î¼g protein was applied to SDS-PAGE. The latex protein was excised from the gel and cut into 10 pieces, digested with trypsin enzyme diluted with NH4HCO3 solution, and the peptides obtained from the digestion were separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography (Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system), then detected and analyzed by tandem MS (Thermo Fisher Q-Exactive).

### Data Protocol
Mascot (version 2.3.01), MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8), Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3/1.4), and UniProt database were used for protein identification and quantification.
