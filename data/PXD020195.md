### Title
Creation of a Candida albicans spectral library by Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA)

### Description
The incidence of candidiasis, caused mainly by the opportunistic fungal Candida albicans, remains a major concern in public health due to the emerging antifungal resistance. C. albicans modulates their proteome under different conditions trying to cope with several stressors in host niches. In this study we developed a C. albicans spectral library by analysing a total of 52 samples corresponding to cells treated with 5 and 10 mM hydrogen peroxide, 40 and 60 mM acetic acid and in the interaction with human macrophages (THP-1) at 3, 6 and 9 h (4 biological replicates). This samples represented several morphologies of C. albicans (yeast and hypha) and different culture conditions (temperature, media…) that contributed to the incorporation of different proteins into the library. The analysis of these conditions by DDA mode allowed the construction of a C. albicans spectral library comprising information of 2879 proteins and 25645 peptides which entailed a 46.5% of the total proteome. The C. albicans spectral library created constitutes a powerful proteomic tool available for the scientific community and could be useful for global (DIA) or targeted (SRM and PRM) studies.

### Sample Protocol
All samples included in the library were digested in-solution by trypsin and 1 µg of peptides were injected and analysed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an EASY-Spray column (Thermo Scientific, 75µm x 2 cm, column temperature 45 ᵒ). A linear gradient from 5% to 30 % acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% formic acid was used for 60 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. For data dependent acquisition (DDA) full MS survey scans (resolution 70,000 at 200 m/z) at mass range 400-1600 m/z were followed by MS/MS scans (resolution 17,500 at 200 m/z) of the top 15 most intense ions using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD)(Malmström et al., 2016).

### Data Protocol
Data acquired in DDA were converted to mzML using MSconvert. MS searches were performed using X! Tandem towards Candida Genome Database Assembly 21 protein reference database (A21-s02-m09-r10) or synthetic retention time peptide sequences with reverse decoys. X! Tandem search parameters were fixed to 1 missed peptide cleavage and the following modifications: fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteine and N-terminal variable modifications: acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modification. The precursor and fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm and 50 ppm, respectively. Peptide spectrum matches were filtered to FDR of 1% (peptide q-value<0.01). DDA data filtered was used from the assembly of an assay library using Fraggle with standard settings previously described (Teleman et al., 2017). Briefly, Fraggle interprets and averages MS2 spectra and in a second step, Franklin performed multilevel FDR calculation. Finally Tramler generated an assay library in the standard format (TraML) with only proteins below FDR of 1%.

### Publication Abstract
Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that causes systemic infections in immunosuppressed patients. In order to deal with the changing environment during commensalism or infection, C.&#xa0;albicans must reprogram its proteome. Characterizing the stress-induced changes in the proteome that C. albicans uses to survive should be very useful in the development of new antifungal drugs. We studied the C. albicans global proteome after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and acetic acid (AA), using a data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) strategy. More than 2,000 C. albicans proteins were quantified using an ion library previously constructed using data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry (DDA-MS). C. albicans responded to treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with an increase in the abundance of many proteins involved in the oxidative stress response, protein folding, and proteasome-dependent catabolism, which led to increased proteasome activity. The data revealed a previously unknown key role for Prn1, a protein similar to pirins, in the oxidative stress response. Treatment with AA resulted in a general decrease in the abundance of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, protein folding, and rRNA processing. Almost all proteasome proteins declined, as did proteasome activity. Apoptosis was observed after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but not AA. A targeted proteomic study of 32 proteins related to apoptosis in yeast supported the results obtained by DIA-MS and allowed the creation of an efficient method to quantify relevant proteins after treatment with stressors (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, AA, and amphotericin B). This approach also uncovered a main role for Oye32, an oxidoreductase, suggesting this protein as a possible apoptotic marker common to many stressors. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Fungal infections are a worldwide health problem, especially in immunocompromised patients and patients with chronic disorders. Invasive candidiasis, caused mainly by C.&#xa0;albicans, is among the most common fungal diseases. Despite the existence of treatments to combat candidiasis, the spectrum of drugs available is limited. For the discovery of new drug targets, it is essential to know the pathogen response to different stress conditions. Our study provides a global vision of proteomic remodeling in C.&#xa0;albicans after exposure to different agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and amphotericin B, that can cause apoptotic cell death. These results revealed the significance of many proteins related to oxidative stress response and proteasome activity, among others. Of note, the discovery of Prn1 as a key protein in the defense against oxidative stress as well the increase in the abundance of Oye32 protein when apoptotic process occurred point them out as possible drug targets.
