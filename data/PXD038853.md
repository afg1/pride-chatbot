### Title
PatA-associated proteomics of Mycobacterium smegmatis

### Description
The wild type strain and patA deletion mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis were determined proteomically

### Sample Protocol
Strains were grown in 7H9 medium at 37°C with 160 rpm shaking. All strains were harvested and washed with PBS solution when wild type strains were grown to mid-log phase.

### Data Protocol
After taking appropriate amount of samples for grinding, the protein was extracted and its concentration was determined. The protein samples were enzymolized in equal amounts overnight, then dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and reduced at 56℃ for 30 min. After that, iodoacetamide (IAA) was added at 11 mM and incubated at room temperature for 15 min away from light. The peptides were dissolved in liquid chromatography mobile phase and separated using the EASY-nLC 1200 ultra-high performance liquid phase system. After that, the peptides were separated by an ultra-high performance liquid phase system and ionized by injection into an NSI ion source and then analyzed by Orbitrap Exploris™ 480 mass spectrometry. The ion source voltage was set to 2.3 kV, and the FAIMS compensation voltage (CV) was set to -45 V and -65 V. The parent ions and secondary fragments of the peptide were detected and analyzed using high resolution Orbitrap. The scanning range of primary mass spectrometry is set from 400 to 1200 m/z, and the scanning resolution is set to 60000. The scanning range of the two-stage mass spectrometry was fixed at 110 m/z, the two-stage scanning resolution was set to 15000, and the Turbo TMT was set to off. Proteomics was performed at Hangzhou Jingjie Biotechnology Corporation.
