### Title
Cajanin Stilbene Acid Inhibited Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci By Inhibiting Phosphotransferase System

### Description
In order to determine the mechanism of Cajanin Stilbene Acid inhibiting vancomycin-resistant enterococci, we compared the changes in protein expression of enterococci V583 strain before and after treated by Cajanin Stilbene Acid.

### Sample Protocol
Enterococci V583 strains were inoculated on MH solid medium, cultured in 37��������� incubator for 16 to 24 hours, Single colonies were selected and inoculated in MH liquid medium, and then cultured for 16-24h in a shaker at 37��������� and 200rpm. The culture medium was diluted into to 1������106 CFU/mL bacterial suspension. Enterococci V583 strains was cultured with or without 1������g/mL CSA for 1h. After that the culture were centrifuged at 4���������, collected and washed three times with phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH7.4) and frozen with liquid nitrogen.  The sample was grinded by liquid nitrogen into cell powder and then transferred to a 5-mL centrifuge tube. After that, four volumes of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% Triton-100, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) was added to the cell powder, followed by sonication three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz). The remaining debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g at 4 ������C for 10 min. Finally, the protein was precipitated with cold 20% TCA for 2 h at -20 ������C. After centrifugation at 12,000 g 4 ������C for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded. The remaining precipitate was washed with cold acetone for three times. The protein was redissolved in 8 M urea and the protein concentration was determined with BCA kit according to the manufacturer���������s instructions.

### Data Protocol
GO Annotation The Gene Ontology, or GO, is a major bioinformatics initiative to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species. More specifically, the project aims to:  1. Maintain and develop its controlled vocabulary of gene and gene product attributes; 2. Annotate genes and gene products, and assimilate and disseminate annotation data; 3. Provide tools for easy access to all aspects of the data provided by the project. The ontology covers three domains: 1. Cellular component: A cellular component is just that, a component of a cell, but with the proviso that it is part of some larger object; this may be an anatomical structure (e.g. rough endoplasmic reticulum or nucleus) or a gene product group (e.g. ribosome, proteasome or a protein dimer). 2. Molecular function: Molecular function describes activities, such as catalytic or binding activities, that occur at the molecular level. GO molecular function terms represent activities rather than the entities (molecules or complexes) that perform the actions, and do not specify where or when, or in what context, the action takes place. 3. Biological process: A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more ordered assemblies of molecular functions. It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must have more than one distinct steps. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation proteome was derived from the UniProt-GOA database (www. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/). Firstly, Converting identified protein ID to UniProt ID and then mapping to GO IDs by protein ID. If some identified proteins were not annotated by UniProt-GOA database, the InterProScan soft would be used to annotated protein���������s GO functional based on protein sequence alignment method. Then proteins were classified by Gene Ontology annotationbased on three categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Domain Annotation A protein domain is a conserved part of a given protein sequence and structure that can evolve, function and exist independently of the rest of the protein chain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and often can be independently stable and folded. Many proteins consist of several structural domains. One domain may appear in a variety of different proteins. Molecular evolution uses domains as building blocks and these may be recombined in different arrangements to create proteins with different functions. Domains vary in length from between about 25 amino acids up to 500 amino acids in length. The shortest domains such as zinc fingers are stabilized by metal ions or disulfide bridges. Domains often form functional units, such as the calcium-binding EF hand domain of calmodulin. Because they are independently stable, domains can be "swapped" by genetic engineering between one protein and another to make chimeric proteins. Identified proteins domain functional description were annotated by InterProScan (a sequence analysis application) based on protein sequence alignment method, and the InterPro domain database was used. InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) is a database that integrates diverse information about protein families, domains and functional sites, and makes it freely available to the public via Web-based interfaces and services. Central to the database are diagnostic models, known as signatures, against which protein sequences can be searched to determine their potential function. InterPro has utility in the large-scale analysis of whole genomes and meta-genomes, as well as in characterizing individual protein sequences.

### Publication Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance has become a serious threat to human and animal health, and vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus</i> has become an important nosocomial infection pathogen, causing thousands of deaths each year. In this study, after screening a variety of natural products, we found that cajanin stilbene acid (CSA) had significant inhibitory effect on sensitive and vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus</i> (VRE) <i>in vitro</i>. And we also confirmed that CSA had significant anti-VRE infection ability <i>in vivo</i>. Subsequently, we studied the antibacterial mechanism of CSA through proteomics experiments, and the results showed that CSA killed <i>Enterococcus</i> by inhibiting the phosphotransferase system of <i>Enterococcus</i>, thus hinders the normal growth and metabolic functions of bacteria. The results of this study provided evidence for the in-depth study on the mechanism of the antibacterial action of CSA and also provided a candidate for the development of anti-VRE drugs.
