### Title
Proteomic tools for the quantitative analysis of artificial peptide libraries: detection and characterization of target-amplified PD-1 inhibitors

### Description
We report a quantitative proteomics data analysis pipeline which, coupled to protein-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DDC) experiments, enables the rapid discovery and direct characterization of protein-protein interaction (PPI) modulators. A low-affinity PD-1 binder was incubated with a library of >100 D-peptides under thiol-exchange favoring conditions, in the presence of the target protein PD-1, and we determined the S-linked dimeric species that resulted amplified in the protein samples versus the controls. We chemically synthesized the target dimer candidates and validated them by thermophoresis binding and protein-protein interaction assays. The results provide a proof-of-concept for using this strategy in the high-throughput search of improved drug-like peptide binders that block therapeutically relevant protein-protein interactions.

### Sample Protocol
All peptide stock solutions were prepared in H2O (0.01% FA) to avoid early formation of disulfide oxidised products. The DCC buffer (Tris 100 mM, NaCl 50 mM, oxidised glutathione 0.375 mM, reduced glutathione 1.5 mM, pH 8.5) was freshly prepared. The DCL consisting of 106 D-peptides (LIBs) was diluted to a final concentration of 200 μM (ca. 2 μM of each library component). The PD-i6 anchor ligand (bearing a Cys) was used at a final concentration of 500 μM. When present, human recombinant PD-1 was added at 200 μM to make a final volume of 100 μL for each DCC experiment. Oxygen was removed by repeated cycles of vacuum and refilling with nitrogen, and tubes were reacted on an orbital stirrer at 4ºC for 48h, which ensured equilibration of the libraries.10 Each DCC experiment was performed in triplicates with or without the target protein PD-1, as control. Thiol-disulfide exchange was quenched by the addition of TFA (25 μL). Denatured protein was removed from the DCL by centrifuging at 11 700 g for 10 min. The protein-free solution was subjected to an off-line HPLC purification step using a linear gradient from 10% to 60% of ACN (0.1% TFA) in 20 min on a C18 Phenomenex Gemini column (150 x 4.6 mm, 3 µm). Fractions eluting before and after the PD-i6 homodimer peak were collected separately, lyophilized and kept at -20ºC for further LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Lyophilzed fractions were reconstituted with 3%ACN/1% formic acid aqueous solution. Sample were injected automatically to an Acquity UPLC BEH C8 (Waters, 2.1 x 50 mm; 1.7 μm) column at a flow rate of 100 µL/min using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation) provided with a Binary Solvent Manager and an automatic Autosampler. Samples were eluted using a linear gradient from 10% to 80% of ACN with 0.1% formic acid in 60 min. The column outlet was directly connected to an Advion TriVersa NanoMate (Advion) fitted on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos™ Tribrid (Thermo Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. MS/MS acquisition considered charges z = 1 to 7. An exclusion list of charges z = 1 of the most abundant ion contaminants in solvent was used. Survey MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with the resolution (defined at 200 m/z) set to 120,000. The lock mass was user-defined at m/z 445.12 in each Orbitrap scan. The top speed (most intense) ions per scan were fragmented by HCD and detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution set to 30,000. The ion count target value was 400,000 and 10,000 for the survey scan and for the MS/MS scan respectively. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 15 s.
