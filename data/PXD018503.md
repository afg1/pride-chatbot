### Title
Lignocellulose fermentation to ethanol or lactate by giant panda gut microbiomes depends ultimately on pH rather than portion of bamboo

### Description
Giant panda are carnivorous bears which feed almost exclusively on plant biomass (i.e. bamboo). The potential contribution of its gut microbiome to lignocellulose degradation has been mostly investigated with cultivation-independent approaches. Recently, we reported on the first lab-scale cultivation of giant panda gut microbiomes and described their actual fermentation capacity. Fermentation of bamboo leaf  using green dung resulted in a neutral pH, the main products being ethanol, lactate and H2. Fermentation of bamboo pith using yellow dung resulted in an acidic pH, the main product being lactate.  Here, we cultivated giant panda gut microbiomes to test 1) the impact of mixed dung as inoculum; 2) the fermentation capacity of solid lignocellulose as opposed to organics-rich biofluids in the dung; 3) the artificial shift of pH from neutral to acidic on bamboo leaf fermentation. Our results indicate that i) gut microbiomes fermentation of solid lignocellulose contributes up to a maximum of 1/3 even in the presence of organics-rich biofluids; ii) alcohols are an important product of bamboo leaf fermentation at neutral pH; iii) aside hemicellulose, gut microbiomes may degrade plant cell membranes to produce glycerol; iv) pH, rather than portion of bamboo, ultimately determines fermentation profiles and gut microbiome assemblage.

### Sample Protocol
Culture samples (30 mL) were centrifuged, pellets resuspended in 2 mL 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8) and protein extracted with liquid phenol (Heyer et al., 2013). After protein quantification with amido black assay, 25 µg of proteins were loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE was conducted after proteins entered approximately 5 mm into the separation gel. The complete protein fraction was digested with trypsin, and peptides were measured by LC-MS/MS using an Elite Hybrid Ion Trap Orbitrap MS with a 120 min gradient.

### Data Protocol
For protein identification, a database search with Mascot (Perkins et al., 1999) was performed, using a false discovery rate of 1% (see Supplementary Information ).
