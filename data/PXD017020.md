### Title
Crosslinking mass spectrometry (CLMS) analysis of monoubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI complex

### Description
Vertebrate DNA crosslink repair excises toxic replication-blocking DNA crosslinks. Numerous factors involved in crosslink repair have been identified, and mutations in their corresponding genes cause Fanconi anemia (FA). A key step in crosslink repair is monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer, which then recruits nucleases to remove the DNA lesion. In this study, monoubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI complex was characterized using crosslinking mass spectrometry in order to provide in sights into the 3D structure of the complex.

### Sample Protocol
Purified in vitro ubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI complex (ubD2I) (in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole and 1 mM TCEP) at a concentration of ~1 ��M was crosslinked with 2-fold molar ratio of disulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) for 2 h on ice and the reaction was quenched with 50 mM NH4HCO3 for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then loaded on a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris (ThermoFisher Scientific). Gel bands of crosslinked ubD2I complex were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin. In brief, proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) for 30 min at 37��C and alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) for 20 min at ambient temperature in the dark. Proteins were then digested overnight at 37��C with 10 ng ��L-1 trypsin (Pierce, Germany) in 45 mM ABC and 10% v/v acetonitrile. Following digestion, peptides were extracted from the gel and de-salted using C18 StageTips. Peptides were then eluted from the StageTip using 40 ��L 80% v/v acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) into a LowBind Eppendorf sample tube. Solvent in the eluate was removed using vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator 5305 plus, Eppendorf, Germany). For LC-MS/MS analysis, peptides were re-suspended with the sample loading buffer (0.1% v/v formic acid (FA), 1.6% v/v ACN) to a concentration of ~ 0.3 ug uL-1, and 3.5 ��L was injected for LC-MS/MS acquisition.  LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Orbitrap FusionTM LumosTM TribridTM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled on-line to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 50-centimetre EASY-Spray C18 LC column (Thermo Scientific) that is operated at 50 ��C column temperature. Mobile phase A consists of water, 0.1% v/v formic acid and mobile phase B consists of 80% v/v acetonitrile and 0.1% v/v formic acid. Peptides were loaded at a flowrate of 0.3 ��L/min. With the same flowrate, peptides were eluted using a linear gradient going from 2% mobile phase B to 40% mobile phase B over 110 minutes, followed by a linear increase from 40% to 95% mobile phase B in eleven minutes. Eluted peptides were ionized by an EASY-Spray source (Thermo Scientific). The MS data is acquired in the data-dependent mode with the top-speed option. For each three-second acquisition cycle, the full scan mass spectrum was recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000. The ions with a charge state from 3+ to 7+ were isolated and fragmented using Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). For each isolated precursor, one of three collision energy settings (26%, 28% or 30%) was selected for fragmentation using data dependent decision tree based on the m/z and charge of the precursor. The fragmentation spectra were then recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 50000. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with single repeat count and 60-second exclusion duration.

### Data Protocol
Data processing protocol The MS2 peak lists were generated from the raw mass spectrometric data files using the MSConvert module in ProteoWizard (version 3.0.11729). The default parameters were applied, except that Top MS/MS Peaks per 100 Da was set to 20 and the de-noising function was enabled. The MS1 and MS2 m/z were recalibrated using an in-house script. Using this script, a pre-search against the sequences of FANCI, FANCD2, ubiquitin was carried out using xiSEARCH software (https://www.rappsilberlab.org/software/xisearch) with following parameters: MS accuracy = 20 ppm; MS2 accuracy = 25 ppm; enzyme = trypsin (with full tryptic specificity); allowed number of missed cleavages = two; missing monoisotopic peak=2; crosslinker = BS3 the reaction specificity for BS3 was assumed to be for lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and protein N termini); fixed modifications = carbamidomethylation on cysteine; variable modifications = oxidation on methionine, modifications by BS3 that are hydrolyzed or amidated on the end. Based on identified linear matches (with score >6), MS1 and MS2 m/z were recalibrated. The recalibrated peak lists were then searched against the sequences and the reversed sequences (as decoys) of FANCI, FANCD2, ubiquitin plus 4514 E.coli proteins using xiSEARCH software (version 1.7.754) for identification of crosslinked peptides. The following parameters were applied for the search: MS accuracy = 5 ppm; MS2 accuracy = 10 ppm; enzyme = trypsin (with full tryptic specificity); allowed number of missed cleavages = two; missing monoisotopic peak=2{Lenz, 2018 #142}; crosslinker = BS3 the reaction specificity for BS3 was assumed to be for lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and protein N termini); fixed modifications = carbamidomethylation on cysteine; variable modifications = oxidation on methionine, modifications by BS3 that are hydrolyzed or amidated on the end. False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated based on the number of decoy identification in ubID2 sequences.

### Publication Abstract
Vertebrate DNA crosslink repair excises toxic replication-blocking DNA crosslinks. Numerous factors involved in crosslink repair have been identified, and mutations in their corresponding genes cause Fanconi anemia (FA). A key step in crosslink repair is monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer, which then recruits nucleases to remove the DNA lesion. Here, we use cryo-EM to determine the structures of recombinant chicken FANCD2 and FANCI complexes. FANCD2-FANCI adopts a closed conformation when the FANCD2 subunit is monoubiquitinated, creating a channel that encloses double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Ubiquitin is positioned at the interface of FANCD2 and FANCI, where it acts as a covalent molecular pin to trap the complex on DNA. In contrast, isolated FANCD2 is a homodimer that is unable to bind DNA, suggestive of an autoinhibitory mechanism that prevents premature activation. Together, our work suggests that FANCD2-FANCI is a clamp that is locked onto DNA by ubiquitin, with distinct interfaces that may recruit other DNA repair factors.
