### Title
Streptococcus mutans UA159 proteomics

### Description
Comparative proteomic analysis of the biofilm proteome of the wild-type strain, mutant strain, and compound treated strain.

### Sample Protocol
Biofilm samples were lysed by a lysis buffer (8M urea, 40mM HEPES, PH =7.6) and sonicated with a Q125 Sonicator (Qsonica, CT, USA) set at 65% amplitude (five blasts each lasting 15 s with 30 s pauses) . Protein was further purified by a 2-D Cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad). Approximately 50 μg of protein from each sample was reduced, alkylated, digested by sequencing grade Trypsin (Promega), and labelled with TMT 10-plex reagents (TMT 10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set, Thermo Scientific, USA) following our former experimental procedure.

### Data Protocol
The raw spectra were searched against the Streptococcus mutans UA159 protein database (containing 1852 protein sequences) with the searching engine of Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher). The settings were listed as below: max missed cleavage site = 2, precursor mass tolerance = 10ppm, fragment mass tolerance = 0.02Da, fixed modification = carbamidomethyl (C), and dynamic modification= oxidation (M) and TMT (K,Y). The false discovery rate (FDR) of the protein identification was set as 1%.
