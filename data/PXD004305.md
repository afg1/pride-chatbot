### Title
Proteomic insights into mannan degradation and protein secretion by the forest floor bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis

### Description
Study on proteins secreted by C. pinesis upon growth on mannan substrates, focusing on carbohydrate active proteins

### Sample Protocol
Growth on agar plates, trypsination directly after freezing, thawing and crushing of agar.  Zip-tip and LC-MS analysis (QExactive).

### Data Protocol
Quantification using MaxQuant, and processed using Perseus. Different servers was used for  annotation of subcellular location.

### Publication Abstract
None
