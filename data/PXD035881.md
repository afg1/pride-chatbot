### Title
Neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent alterations in mouse microglia function are not cell-intrinsic

### Description
We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a germline heterozygous knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1+/- mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1+/- mice exhibited defects in purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1+/- microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with potential defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1+/- microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity. Next, to determine whether these microglial defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1 heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with Cx3cr1-CreER mice (Nf1flox/wt; Cx3cr1-CreER mice, Nf1MG+/- mice). Surprisingly, neither male nor female Nf1MG+/- mouse microglia had impaired process arborization or surveillance capacity. In contrast, when Nf1 heterozygosity was generated in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by intercrossing Nf1flox/flox with hGFAP-Cre mice (Nf1flox/wt; hGFAP-Cre mice, Nf1GFAP+/- mice), the microglia defects found in Nf1+/- mice were recapitulated. Collectively, these data reveal that Nf1+/- sexually dimorphic microglia abnormalities are likely not cell-intrinsic properties, but rather reflect a response to Nf1 heterozygosity in other brain cells.

### Sample Protocol
Global proteome analysis was conducted using isobaric TMTpro 16-plex labeling (Thermo Fisher Scientific) essentially as described in Mertins et al. (2018). Samples were lysed in urea buffer and digested with trypsin (Promega). Of each sample, 12 µg peptide was assigned to channels 1 through 13 as well as channel 15 in a randomized fashion. Channel 16 was used as a booster channel and loaded with 70 µg of a mix of the remaining peptide material. Channel 14 was kept empty. The combined TMT cassette was deeply fractionated using high-pH HPLC separation into 30 fractions using a 1290 Infinity II LC System (Agilent Technologies). An estimate of 1 µg of each fraction was injected into LC-MS analysis on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent mode using a 110 min gradient on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an in-house packed column (C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads; Dr. Maisch Reprosil-Pur 120).

### Data Protocol
For database search, MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 (Cox and Mann 2008) was used whilst enabling TMTpro 16-plex reporter ion quantitation with a PIF setting of 0.5. Downstream analysis was done in R. For quantitation, a complete data matrix was required for the experimental conditions (14 out of 16 channels). Reporter ion intensities were normalized and scaled using median-MAD normalization. For significance calling two-sample moderated t-tests were applied (limma R package; Ritchie et al. 2015). P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

### Publication Abstract
We previously discovered a sex-by-genotype defect in microglia function using a heterozygous germline knockout mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mice), in which only microglia from male Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mice exhibited defects in purinergic signaling. Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1 heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1<sup>flox/flox</sup> with Cx3cr1-Cre<sup>ER</sup> mice (Nf1<sup>flox/wt</sup>; Cx3cr1-Cre<sup>ER</sup> mice, Nf1<sup>MG</sup>&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mice). Surprisingly, neither male nor female Nf1<sup>MG</sup>&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mouse microglia had impaired process arborization or surveillance capacity. In contrast, when Nf1 heterozygosity was generated in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by intercrossing Nf1<sup>flox/flox</sup> with hGFAP-Cre mice (Nf1<sup>flox/wt</sup>; hGFAP-Cre mice, Nf1<sup>GFAP</sup>&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mice), the microglia defects found in Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;mice were recapitulated. Collectively, these data reveal that Nf1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;sexually dimorphic microglia abnormalities are likely not cell-intrinsic properties, but rather reflect a response to Nf1 heterozygosity in other brain cells.
