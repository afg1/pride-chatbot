### Title
Phosphoproteomic studies to identify targets and substrates of Protein kinase PfPK2 in human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum

### Description
The purpose of this project was to identify targets and substrates of Protein kinase PfPK2 in malaria parasite P. falciparum. These studies will help understand the mechanisms via which PfPK2, which is indispensable for the parasite survival,  regulates parasite development. For this purpose, PfPK2-loxP parasite line was generated for conditional knock down of PfPK2 using rapamycin (RAP), which was used to induce the dimerization of active Cre-recombinase resulting   in the depletion of PfPK2.

### Sample Protocol
1G5DC or PfPK2-loxP parasites were cultured  and were synchronized using sorbitol. Ring stage parasites were treated with DMSO or RAP for 6h. Subsequently, parasites were harvested upon maturation to schizonts (~44 hpi) using saponin lysis of infected RBCs. The parasite pellet was washed and dissolved in protein extraction buffer (50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEABC) containing 2M SDS, 1X protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and sonicated subsequently followed by centrifugation.The supernatant was used for bicinchoninic acid assay-based protein estimation and equal amount of protein was taken from DMSO and RAP-treated parasites and subjected to reduction (20 mM dithiothreitol, 60°C for 30 minutes) and alkylation (20 mM iodoacetamide, ambient temperature for 10 minutes in dark), then digested over-night with trypsin and Lys-C mix  (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with enzyme protein ratio of 1:100. The resulted peptides were ‎desalted using C18 Sep-Pak (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The dried peptides were proceeding to the tandem mass tags (TMTs) labeling method was followed according to the ‎manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The resulted labeled peptides were fractionated by using C18 stage-top column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and  eluted at different concentrations of acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid (FA). Total of 24 fractions was collected and concatenated into six fractions. This study was conducted in three biological replicates.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data were acquired on Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer interfaced with Proxeon easy nano-LC 1200 system (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).  The data was acquired in Data-dependent acquisition method in two technical replicates. The obtained data from each biological replicate were searched against PlasmoDB reference protein (version 46). Sequest and Mascot (version 2.2) search algorithms were used through Proteome Discoverer 2.1 suite (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). A precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 0.02 Da was used. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, TMT labeling at peptide N-terminus and lysine residues were selected as static modification. Methionine residues oxidation, acetylation of protein N-ternimus, and phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine residues were selected as dynamic modifications. Percolator node was used to compute the false discovery rate (FDR) at PSM level and posterior error probability score. The data was filtered at 1% PSM level FDR. Perseus software (version 1.4) was used to compute the t-test and p-value for each phosphopeptide. To get the differentially expressed phosphorylated peptide fold-change cut of 1.2 (p-value <0.05) was applied on the total proteome normalised data.
