### Title
NanoTPOT: Enhanced Sample Preparation for Quantitative Nanoproteomic Analysis

### Description
In this study, we developed and optimized a nanoproteomic workflow that we termed Nanogram TMT Processing in One Tube (NanoTPOT). Through the assessment of proteolytic digestion, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, online and offline frac-tionation strategies, our optimized workflow effectively eliminated the need for sample desalting and enabled compatible sample processing for MS analysis. We further applied the NanoTPOT workflow to examine cellular response to stress caused by dithiothreitol in Hela cells, where we identified and quantified 6935 proteins in a TMT 10-plex experiment with one microgram of starting material in each channel.

### Sample Protocol
In our optimized NanoTPOT protocol, 1 ������g HeLa cell lysate in 10 ������l 0.1% RapiGest ��������� 20 mM Triethylammoni-um bicarbonate (TEAB) was reduced with 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide, and digested with 0.4 ������g Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin. The resulting 1 ������g tryptic peptide samples were directly labeled with 40 ������g TMT reagent without prior desalting. Labeled samples were then quenched with 0.5% hydroxylamine and pooled for direct injection onto the 2D LC-MS/MS with no desalting step. The entire workflow was completed in a single 0.5 mL protein LoBind tubes.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS raw files were searched using Proteome Discoverer V2.2 (Thermo Fisher) against the SwissProt human database (released in June 2017), with the following parameters: full tryptic specificity with up to two missed cleavage sites, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, along with TMT labeling of peptide N-termini and lysine residues as fixed modification, and protein N-terminal acetylation plus methionine oxidation as variable modifications. The false discovery rate was set to 0.01.

### Publication Abstract
With the ever-growing need for protein-level understanding in pathological research, proteomics researchers thrive to examine detailed proteome dynamics using crucial, yet often limited, primary and clinical samples. Aside from mass spectrometer instrumentation advancement, a single-tube-based high-throughput sample processing workflow is imperative to ensure sensitive, quantitative, and reproducible protein analysis for these increasingly sophisticated studies. Leveraging the benefits of an acid-cleavable detergent, RapiGest SF Surfactant (Waters Corporation), we developed and optimized a nanoproteomic workflow that we termed Nanogram TMT Processing in One Tube (NanoTPOT). Through the assessment of proteolytic digestion, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, online and offline fractionation strategies, our optimized workflow effectively eliminated the need for sample desalting and enabled compatible sample processing for mass spectrometry analysis. We further applied the NanoTPOT workflow to examine cellular response to stress caused by dithiothreitol in HeLa cells, where we identified and quantified 6935 and 5474 proteins in TMT 10-plex experiments with one microgram of lysate protein and 2000 sorted HeLa cells (roughly half microgram lysate protein) in each channel, respectively. Our workflow has been proven to be an effective alternative for current nanoproteomic sample processing to minimize sample loss in biological and clinical applications.
