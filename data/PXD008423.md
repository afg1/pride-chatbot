### Title
Systems toxicology assessment of CHTP1.2 [Liver Data]

### Description
Modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) have the potential to reduce smoking-related health risks. The Carbon Heated Tobacco Product 1.2 (CHTP1.2) is a potential MRTP that uses a pressed carbon heat source to generate an aerosol by heating tobacco. This study reports the results from the systems toxicology arm of a 90-day rat inhalation study (OECD test guideline 413) to assess the effects of CHTP1.2 aerosol compared with cigarette smoke (CS). Rats were exposed to filtered air (sham), to CHTP1.2 aerosol (at 15, 23 and 50 µg nicotine / L), or to the 3R4F reference cigarette smoke (at 23 µg nicotine / L).

### Sample Protocol
Outbred male and female Sprague-Dawley rats [Crl:CD(SD)], bred under specific pathogen-free conditions and approximately 6-8 weeks of age, were obtained from Charles River, USA (Raleigh, R04)). The study was performed in the test facility, an AVA-licensed and AAALAC-accredited facility where care and use of the animals are in accordance with the NACLAR Guidelines 2004. The animals were exposed to aerosol from CHTP1.2 targeting nicotine concentrations of 15 Âµg/l (low concentration), 23 Âµg/l (medium concentration) and 50 Âµg/l (high concentration). Animals exposed to 3R4F cigarette smoke (CS) at 23 Âµg/l nicotine were included as a reference group, and a fresh air exposed group of animals (sham) served as control group. The aerosols were generated using validated smoking machines, and were delivered into flow-pass nose-only exposure chambers. Rats were exposed to aerosol or filtered air for 6 h/day, 5 days/week, for approximately 13 weeks (Note, exposure was extended to 7 days per week during the adaptation, and prior to the necropsy). A time adaptation phase was included during the first 7 days of the exposure to acclimatize rats to the target aerosol concentration (1.5 h exposure for first and second day, 3 h exposure for third and fourth day and 4.5 h exposure for days 5 to 7)  Full necropsy was performed without prior fasting on the day following the last exposure. Prior to each dissection, the animals were randomized in the preparation of the dissection schedule.  The dissection coordinator ensured that there was no bias in the spread of animals across the exposure groups for each dissection day and dissector. Different dissection protocols were used, depending on the endpoint.  Liver dissections were collected for transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics, and stored at âˆ’80Â°C.  Liver tissue samples were homogenized using a bead-assisted procedure in a Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen) in tissue lysis buffer (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) before acetone precipitation (in random order).  Protein precipitates were resuspended in 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich). Next, 50 Âµg of the suspension were processed using the iTRAQ 8-plex labeling procedure according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Trypsin-Lys C mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the samples in a 1:10 trypsin to protein ratio (w/w), followed by overnight digestion at 37Â°C. The trypsin-digested samples were labeled with reporter-ion tags for the different exposure groups.  Two multiplexed iTRAQ analysis sets, with randomized set and reporter ion channel assignments, were defined. iTRAQ Set 1 contained all samples of the 90-day time point: each 8-plex labeling replicate set included one sample of each 90-day exposed sample and one pooled reference mix containing all replicates from the 90-day time point. iTRAQ set 2 focused on the exposure and 90+42d recovery effect for female rats only: each 8-plex labeling set included one sample of each 90+42-day sample and the corresponding female sample from the 90-day time point. All labeled samples that belonged to one iTRAQ replicate set were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator (RVC 2-25 CD Plus, Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Samples were desalted using 0.5-mL bed detergent removal columns (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and then using 1-cc C18 reversed-phase Sep Pak columns (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ manuals. Samples were dried in a SpeedVac evaporator. Samples were resuspended in nanoLC buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were analyzed in random order using an Easy nanoLC 1000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected online to a Q Exactive mass-analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm Acclaimâ„¢ PepMapâ„¢ 100 C18 LC column (2-Âµm particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min, with a 200-min gradient from nanoLC buffer A to 40% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid. Each sample was injected twice with two different analytical methods, one fast and one sensitive method, as described previously (Kelstrup et al., 2012), on the same column.

### Data Protocol
The outputs of both mass spectrometry runs were combined as merged mass-lists and searched against the rat reference proteome set (UniProt, version October 2013, canonical isoforms only) using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4.0.288 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SequestHT implemented in Proteome Discoverer was used as the search tool. The Percolator node of Proteome Discoverer was used to estimate peptide-level fdr-adjusted p-values (q-values).   iTRAQ reporter-ion intensities were determined with Proteome Discoverer. iTRAQ peptide-level quantification data were exported and further processed in the R statistical environment (R Development Core Team, 2007). The quantification data were filtered for a q-value < 0.01 and for Ã¢â‚¬Å“uniqueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quantification results, as defined in Proteome Discoverer. A global variance-stabilizing normalization was performed with the corresponding Bioconductor package in R (Huber et al., 2002; Hultin-Rosenberg et al., 2013). Each iTRAQ reporter-ion set was normalized to its median, and protein expression values were calculated as the median of these normalized peptide-level quantification values (Herbrich et al., 2013). To detect differentially abundant proteins, a linear model was fitted for each exposure condition and the respective sham group, and p-values were calculated from moderated t-statistics with the empirical Bayes approach (Gentleman et al., 2004). Proteins with an fdr-adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially abundant.

### Publication Abstract
Modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) have the potential to reduce smoking-related health risks. The Carbon Heated Tobacco Product 1.2 (CHTP1.2) is a potential MRTP that uses a pressed carbon heat source to generate an aerosol by heating tobacco. Here, we report the results from the systems toxicology arm of a 90-day rat inhalation study (OECD test guideline 413) to assess the effects of CHTP1.2 aerosol compared with cigarette smoke (CS). Transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics analyses complemented the standard endpoints. In the respiratory nasal epithelium, CS induced an adaptive tissue and inflammatory response, which was much weaker after CHTP1.2 aerosol exposure, mostly limited to the highest CHTP1.2 concentration (at twice the 3R4F CS concentration: 50 vs. 23&#x202f;&#x3bc;g nicotine/L), in female rats. In the lungs, the effects of CS exposure included inflammatory and cellular stress responses, which were absent or much lower after CHTP1.2 aerosol exposure. Outside of the respiratory tract, CS and CHTP1.2 aerosol induced effects that were previously associated with exposure to any nicotine-containing aerosol, e.g., lower lipid concentrations in serum. Overall, this systems toxicology analysis complements and confirms the results from classical toxicological endpoints and further suggests potentially reduced respiratory health risks of CHTP1.2.
