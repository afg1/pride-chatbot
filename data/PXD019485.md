### Title
Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor reduces cocaine-seeking and downregulates glutamatergic synaptic proteins in medial prefrontal cortex

### Description
Abstract Background Psychostimulant use disorder is a major public health issue, and despite the scope of the problem there are currently no FDA approved treatments. There would be tremendous utility in development of a treatment that could help patients both achieve and maintain abstinence. Previous work from our group has identified granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a neuroactive cytokine that alters behavioral response to cocaine, increases synaptic dopamine release, and enhances cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigate the role of G-CSF in affecting extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking and perform detailed characterization of its proteomic effects in multiple limbic substructures.  Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with PBS or G-CSF during (1) extinction or (2) abstinence from cocaine self-administration, and drug seeking behavior was measured. Quantitative assessment of changes in the proteomic landscape in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were performed via data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry analysis.  Results Administration of G-CSF during extinction accelerated the rate of extinction, and administration during abstinence attenuated cue-induced cocaine-seeking. Analysis of global protein expression demonstrated that G-CSF regulated proteins primarily in mPFC that are critical to glutamate signaling and synapse maintenance.  Conclusion Taken together, these findings support G-CSF as a viable translational research target with the potential to reduce drug craving or seeking behaviors. Importantly, recombinant G-CSF exists as an FDA-approved medication which may facilitate rapid clinical translation. Additionally, using cutting-edge multi-region discovery proteomics analyses, these studies identify a novel mechanism underlying G-CSF effects on behavioral plasticity.

### Sample Protocol
Sample Preparation for LC–MS/MS NAc and mPFC tissues were lysed with a probe sonicator in solubilization buffer (8 M urea 0.4mM, ammonium bicarbonate pH 8). Lysate was centrifuged at max speed for 10 minutes at 10 °C in a tabletop centrifuge to pellet cellular debris. Supernatant containing proteins (50 µg) was placed into an Eppendorf tube, and the volume was adjusted to 100 µL with solubilization buffer. Proteins were reduced with 5 µL of 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. They were then alkylated with 5 µL of 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After diluting with water to bring urea concentration to 2 M, sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added at a weight ratio of 1:20 (trypsin/protein) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The digested samples were then acidified with 0.1% formic acid, desalted using C18 spin columns (The Nest Group, Inc., Southborough, MA, USA), and dried in a rotary evaporator. The samples were resuspended in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 2% acetonitrile (ACN) in water prior to LC–MS/MS analysis.  Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) DIA LC–MS/MS was performed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer. After injection, the samples were loaded into a trapping column (nanoACQUITY UPLC Symmetry C18 Trap column, 180 µm × 20 mm) at a flow rate of 5 µL/min and separated with a C18 column (nanoACQUITY column Peptide BEH C18, 75 µm × 250 mm). The compositions of mobile phases A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in ACN, respectively. The peptides were separated and eluted with a gradient extending from 6% to 35% mobile phase B in 90 min and then to 85% mobile phase B in additional 15 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a column temperature of 37 °C. Column regeneration and up to three blank injections were carried out in between all sample injections. The data were acquired with the mass spectrometer operating in a data-independent mode with an isolation window width of 25 m/z. The full scan was performed in the range of 400–1,000 m/z with “Use Quadrupole Isolation” enabled at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z and automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4 × 105. Fragment ions from each peptide MS2 were generated in the C-trap with higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 28% and detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000.  DIA spectra were searched against a Rattus norvegicus brain proteome fractionated spectral library generated from DDA LC MS/MS spectra (collected from the same Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer) using Scaffold DIA software v. 1.1.1 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA). Within Scaffold DIA, raw files were first converted to the mzML format using ProteoWizard v. 3.0.11748. The samples were then aligned by retention time and individually searched with a mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm. The data acquisition type was set to “Non-Overlapping DIA”, and the maximum missed cleavages was set to 2. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02). Dynamic modifications included phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+79.96), deamination of asparagine and glutamine (+0.98), oxidation of methionine and proline (+15.99), and acetylation of lysine (+42.01). Peptides with charge states between 2 and 4 and 6–30 amino acids in length were considered for quantitation, and the resulting peptides were filtered by Percolator v. 3.01 at a threshold FDR of 0.01. Peptide quantification was performed by EncyclopeDIA v. 0.6.12 (Searle et al., 2018), and six of the highest quality fragment ions were selected for quantitation. Proteins containing redundant peptides were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony, and proteins were filtered at a threshold of two peptides per protein and an FDR of 1%.

### Data Protocol
Pathway analysis Proteins were excluded from analysis if they were not detected in > 50% of all samples irrespective of treatment. Pairwise comparisons of the Log10 median intensity of every remaining protein and protein group were made using Scaffold DIA proteomics analysis software (http://www.proteomesoftware.com/products/dia/). Significantly upregulated downregulated proteins from each brain region were separately uploaded into the open source pathway analysis software package G:Profiler (Raudvere et al., 2019) (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) to identify significantly enriched gene ontologies and KEGG pathways using an FDR corrected p < 0.05. Given that this software utilizes gene names for identifying pathways, all protein names were converted to gene names prior to pathway analysis using the Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/). Tables listing all protein to gene name conversions in each region are available as Tables S1-S2. To generate Fig. 5, related pathway terms were reduced using Revigo (Supek et al., 2011) (http://revigo.irb.hr/) and portions of figure were created with BioRender.com. Upregulated and downregulated proteins from NAc and mPFC were separately uploaded into the STRING database (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) (https://string-db.org/) and enrichment of protein-protein interactions was assessed with the “multiple proteins” query using default settings. Statistical analyses for protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichment, and number of predicted interactions per protein (average node degree), were performed utilizing the STRING analysis software. For visualization of protein-protein interaction networks disconnected nodes were removed from the image, and node size was adjusted to correspond to the −log(p) relative to PBS control.

However, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapies. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the immune system may be a viable translational research strategy; preclinical studies have found that the neuroactive cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alters cocaine reward and reinforcement and can enhance cognitive flexibility. Given this basis of evidence we studied the effects of G-CSF treatment on extinction and reinstatement of cocaine seeking. We find that administration of G-CSF accelerates extinction and reduces cue-induced drug seeking after cocaine self-administration. In addition, G-CSF leads to downregulation of synaptic glutamatergic proteins in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggesting that G-CSF influences drug seeking via glutamatergic mechanisms.
