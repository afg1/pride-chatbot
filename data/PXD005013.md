### Title
Genetic profiling and surface proteome analysis of epicardial derived cells reveals cardiogenic potential

### Description
Rationale: Epicardium-derived cells (EPDC) are formed in response to myocardial infarction and recapitulate an embryonic program that is likely to participate in cardiac regeneration and remodeling. The existence of atrial counterparts that are potentially involved in atrial remodeling is still elusive.  Objective: We have elaborated and validated techniques for the robust isolation and cultivation of atrial and ventricular EPDC from the rat heart and compared their molecular phenotype with human atrial stromal cells obtained from tissue biopsies.  Methods and Results: In vitro culture revealed that rat and human cells display a similar morphology, are highly enriched for the epicardial markers WT-1 and Tbx18 throughout in vitro expansion, strongly express the stem/progenitor cell markers CD73, CD90 and, surprisingly the early and late cardiac markers Gata4, Tbx5 and troponin T. In general, these cells display a similar molecular signature - which is different from human MSC - when analyzed by FACS, immunohistochemistry and real time PCR. We also examined the cell surface proteome of human and rat EPDC using cell surface biotinylation combined with nano-liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Proteome analysis revealed the presence of 149 overlapping proteins and >200 species specific proteins. These proteins are preferentially involved in cardiac repair and regeneration.       Conclusions: This study demonstrates that atrial stromal cells are EPDC suggesting a common epicardial precursor. Cell surface proteome analysis suggests that atrial and ventricular EPDC are likely to play an important role during atrial and ventricular remodeling.

### Sample Protocol
Three individual samples (5 µg each) of isolated surface proteins of human atrial and rat ventricular cells were shortly separated (~4 mm running distance) in a 4-12% acrylamide gel followed by silver staining. Protein containing bands were destained, washed, reduced by dithiothreitol, alkylated by iodoacetamide and digested overnight with 0.1 µg trypsin in 10 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate at 37°C. Resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and after vacuum concentration resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Subsequently, ~ 500 ng of the peptide mixture was separated by an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation Liquid Chromatography system. In a first step, peptides were pre-concentrated on a trap column (Acclaim PepMap100, 3 µm C18 particle size, 100 Å pore size, 75 µm inner diameter, 2 cm length) at a flow rate of 6 µl/min for ten minutes using 0.1% TFA as mobile phase. Concentrated peptides were separated on an analytical column (Acclaim PepMapRSLC, 2 µm C18 particle size, 100 Å pore size, 75 µm inner diameter, 25 cm length, Thermo Fisher) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min at 60°C using a 2 h gradient from 4 to 40% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 84% (v/v) acetonitrile in water) in solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water).The liquid chromatography system was online coupled to the mass spectrometer via a nano electrospray ionization source and peptides injected by distal coated Silica Tip emitters using a spray voltage of 1.4 kV.  For the analysis of rat ventricular EPDC samples an Orbitrap Elite  ion trap mass spectrometer was used. First, precursor scans were carried out in the orbitrap analyser of the instrument with a resolution of 60000 (at 400 m/z) over a 350-1700 m/z mass range using a maximum fill time of 200 ms and a target value for the automatic gain control of 1000000. Second, fragment spectra were recorded in a data dependent setting: The 20 most intense two- and three fold charged precursor ions with a minimal signal of 500 were further analyzed in the linear ion trap part of the instrument: precursors were isolated, fragmented using collision induced dissociation and analyzed over an available mass range from 200 to 2000 m/z at a resolution of 5400 (at 400 m/z) with a maximal fill time of 300 ms and an automatic gain control target value of 10000. Already fragmented precursor ions were excluded for further analysis for 45 seconds, the capillary temperature was set to 275°C.  The human atrial cell samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer. Full scans were recorded in the orbitrap analyzer in profile mode with a resolution of 70000 over a scan range from 350 to 2000 m/z with a maximum ion time of 80 ms and the targedtarget value for the automatic gain control set to 3000000. Up to ten two- and threefold charged precursor ions were isolated by the build in quadrupole within a 2 m/z isolation window, fragmented via higher-energy collisional dissociation and fragments analyzed in the orbitrap analyzer with a maximal ion time of 60 ms and the targedtarget value for the automatic gain control set to 100000. The resolution was set to 17500 and the available scan range 200 to 2000 m/z and spectra were recorded in centroid mode. Already fragmented precursors were excluded from analysis for the next 100 seconds; the capillary temperature was set to 250°C. Both instruments were operated in positive mode.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification was carried out within the MaxQuant framework (version 1.5.3.8, MPI for Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany) using standard parameters if not otherwise stated. Spectra were searched against proteome datasets downloaded from UniProtKB at 19th November 2015 (rat samples: UP000002494, 29886 entries; human samples: UP000005640, 20187 entries) with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm for the first and 4.5 ppm for the second search and a fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm (Q Exactive) and 0.5 Da (Orbitrap Elite), respectively. Tryptic cleavage specificity was considered with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites as well as carbamidomethyl as fixed and methionine-oxidation, acetylation at protein N-termini and +145.0197 (cleaved and alkylated biotin linker) as variable modification. Proteins and peptides were accepted at a false discovery rate of both 1% and only proteins with at least two different peptides considered as identified. Label-free quantification was enabled with a minimal ratio count of 2 as well as re-quantification and the match between runs option.

### Publication Abstract
Epicardium-derived cells (EPDC) and atrial stromal cells (ASC) display cardio-regenerative potential, but the molecular details are still unexplored. Signals which induce activation, migration and differentiation of these cells are largely unknown. Here we have isolated rat ventricular EPDC and rat/human ASC and performed genetic and proteomic profiling. EPDC and ASC expressed epicardial/mesenchymal markers (WT-1, Tbx18, CD73, CD90, CD44, CD105), cardiac markers (Gata4, Tbx5, troponin T) and also contained phosphocreatine. We used cell surface biotinylation to isolate plasma membrane proteins of rEPDC and hASC, Nano-liquid chromatography with subsequent mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis identified 396 rat and 239 human plasma membrane proteins with 149 overlapping proteins. Functional GO-term analysis revealed several significantly enriched categories related to extracellular matrix (ECM), cell migration/differentiation, immunology or angiogenesis. We identified receptors for ephrin and growth factors (IGF, PDGF, EGF, anthrax toxin) known to be involved in cardiac repair and regeneration. Functional category enrichment identified clusters around integrins, PI3K/Akt-signaling and various cardiomyopathies. Our study indicates that EPDC and ASC have a similar molecular phenotype related to cardiac healing/regeneration. The cell surface proteome repository will help to further unravel the molecular details of their cardio-regenerative potential and their role in cardiac diseases.
