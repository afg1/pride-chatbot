### Title
Comparative proteomics investigating the physiological roles of menaquinones (vitamin K2) in Lactococcus cremoris

### Description
This study examined phenotypes of Lactococcus cremoris strains MG1363 and mutants with different vitamin K2 chain length  profile, to understand the physiological roles of short-chain and long-chain menaquinones (vitamin K2) in L. cremoris.

### Sample Protocol
L. lactis strains were cultivated in GM17 media at 30 ⁰C overnight (16h) under anaerobic, aerobic and respiration-permissive conditions. Cells were harvested, washed and resuspended in 100 mM Tris (pH 8) and lysed by sonication. For each strain and condition combination, samples were collected from three independent experiments. For all samples 40 μg proteins were used for sample preparation and analysis. Sample preparation followed the filter assisted sample preparation protocol (FASP) (Wiśniewski et al., 2009), in which proteins were reduced with 15 mM dithiothreitol, alkylated with 20 mM acrylamide, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were measured by nLC – Orbitrap Q Exactive-HFX MSMS.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (1.6.3.4) with Andromeda search engine was used for identification and relative quantitation.

### Publication Abstract
<i>Lactococcus cremoris</i> and <i>L. lactis</i> are well known for their occurrence and applications in dairy fermentations, but their niche extends to a range of natural and food production environments. <i>L. cremoris</i> and <i>L. lactis</i> produce MKs (vitamin K2), mainly as the long-chain forms represented by MK-9 and MK-8, and a detectable number of short-chain forms represented by MK-3. The physiological significance of the different MK forms in the lifestyle of these bacterial species has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we used <i>L. cremoris</i> MG1363 to construct mutants producing different MK profiles by deletion of genes encoding (i) a menaquinone-specific isochorismate synthase, (ii) a geranyltranstransferase, and (iii) a prenyl diphosphate synthase. These gene deletions resulted in (i) a non-MK producer (&#x394;<i>menF</i>), (ii) a presumed MK-1 producer (&#x394;<i>ispA</i>), and (iii) an MK-3 producer (&#x394;<i>llmg_0196</i>), respectively. By examining the phenotypes of the MG1363 wildtype strain and respective mutants, including biomass accumulation, stationary phase survival, oxygen consumption, primary metabolites, azo dye/copper reduction, and proteomes, under aerobic, anaerobic, and respiration-permissive conditions, we could infer that short-chain MKs like MK-1 and MK-3 are preferred to mediate extracellular electron transfer and reaction with extracellular oxygen, while the long-chain MKs like MK-9 and MK-8 are more efficient in aerobic respiratory electron transport chain. The different electron transfer routes mediated by short-chain and long-chain MKs likely support growth and survival of <i>L. cremoris</i> in a range of (transiently) anaerobic and aerobic niches including food fermentations, highlighting the physiological significance of diverse MKs in <i>L. cremoris</i>.
