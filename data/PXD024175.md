### Title
Proteotranscriptomic classification and characterization of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms

### Description
Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous neoplasms. We used quantitative global proteomic analysis on 40 PNENs to compliment paired transcriptome data.

### Sample Protocol
Unbiased whole proteome analysis was performed on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms using single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) clinical proteomics as described in: Hughes CS, McConechy MK, Cochrane DR, Nazeran T, Karnezis AN, Huntsman DG, et al. Quantitative Profiling of Single Formalin Fixed Tumour Sections: proteomics for translational research. Sci Rep. 2016 10 7;6:34949.

### Data Protocol
Data from the Orbitrap Fusion were processed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher) as previously described in Hughes CS, McConechy MK, Cochrane DR, Nazeran T, Karnezis AN, Huntsman DG, et al. Quantitative Profiling of Single Formalin Fixed Tumour Sections: proteomics for translational research. Sci Rep. 2016 10 7;6:34949. Briefly, Sequest HT was used to search for MS2 spectral matches against a combination of UniProt Human and Escherichia coli proteomes and a list of common contaminants. Percolator was used to determine peptide spectral match (PSM) error rates. A q-value cut-off of 0.05 was used to control for false discoveries

### Publication Abstract
Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic proto-oncogene&#xa0;variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies.
