### Title
Isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy trigger proteome remodeling of mouse cardiomyocytes

### Description
Cardiac hypertrophy consists in the enlargement of cardiomyocytes and alteration of the extracellular matrix organization in response to physiological or pathological stress. In pathological hypertrophy ocuurs myocardial damage, loss of cardiomyocytes, fibrosis, inflammation, sarcomere disorganization and metabolic impairment, leading to cardiac dysfunction.The rodent model treated with isoproterenol induces cardiac hypertrophy due the constant activation of Î²-adrenergic receptors. We conducted a quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of cardiomyocytes isolated from hearts of mice treated or not with isoproterenol to better understand the molecular bases of cellular response due to isoproterenol-induced injury.

### Sample Protocol
- Cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts of mice treated or not with isoproterenol; - Cardiomyocyte proteins were extracted using 6M urea / 2M thiourea / 10mM TCEP / 40mM chloroacetamide / 20mM TEAB - Samples were diluted 10-times to reduce urea concentration; - Digestion with trypsin (Promega); - LC-MSE analysis (DIA) on a Synapt G2-Si (Waters).

### Data Protocol
- LC-MSE raw spectra data were analyzed in the Progenesis QI for Proteomics (QIP) v.2.0; - Fasta file: Uniprot/TrEMBL database containing Mus musculus proteins (version 2017_10); - We used carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as variable modification. We allowed up to 2 missed cleavages. Only peptides with FDR < 1% and proteins containing at least 1 unique peptide were used in this study; - Protein intensities were normalized based on median. Since data presented a normal distribution, we used One-Way ANOVA to identify regulated features using p < 0.05
