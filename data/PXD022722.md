### Title
Proteomics of REPLICANT Perfusate Detects Changes in the Metastatic Lymph Node Microenvironment

### Description
n breast cancer (BC), detecting low volumes of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis pre-operatively is difficult and novel biomarkers are needed. We recently showed that patient-derived ALNs can be sustained ex-vivo using normothermic perfusion. We now compare reactive (tumour-free; n = 5) and macrometastatic (containing tumour deposits >2mm; n = 4) ALNs by combining whole section multiplex immunofluorescence with TMT-labelled LC-MS/MS of the circulating perfusate. Macrometastases contained significantly fewer B- and T-cells (CD4+/CD8+/regulatory) than reactive nodes (p = 0.02). Similarly, pathway analysis of the perfusate proteome (119/1453 proteins significantly differentially expressed) showed that immune function was diminished in macrometastases in favour of ‘extracellular matrix degradation’; only ‘neutrophil degranulation’ was preserved. Qualitative comparison of the perfusate proteome to that of node-positive pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma also highlighted ‘neutrophil degranulation’ as a contributing factor to nodal metastasis. Thus, metastasis-induced changes in the REPLICANT perfusate proteome are detectable, and could facilitate biomarker discovery.

### Sample Protocol
Perfusate samples were heated to 95 °C, reduced with Dithiothreitol and alkylated by Iodoacetamide. Following probe sonication, samples underwent Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) in the Amicon Ultra-4 (10KDa cut-off, Millipore)68.  Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB; 100mM) was used in the buffer exchange. Peptides were recovered from the filter after an 18-hour trypsin digestion (Pierce, MS grade) at 37°C with additional two washes of TEAB (100 mM then 1M). Following quantification (Nanodrop), 20 µg of each sample was TMT labelled. The mixture was fractionated on a BEH XBridge C18 column (2.1 mm i.d. x 150 mm) with a 35-minute gradient from 5 – 35% CH3CN/NH4OH then concatenated to 8 fractions for LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos coupled with an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System. Samples were loaded on a nanotrap (100 µm id x 2 cm) (PepMap C18, 5 µ) then separated on an analytical column (75 µm id x 50 cm) (PepMap C18, 2µ) over a 90-minute gradient of 4 – 30.4% CH3CN/0.1% formic acid/ 120 min cycle time per fraction. The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos was operated in the Top Speed mode at 3 s per cycle and data was acquired via the MS3-SPS5 method.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher) using the Sequest HT search engine. Spectra were searched against a reviewed Uniprot Homo sapiens database (March 2019). Peptides were validated by Percolator with q-value set at 0.01 (strict) and 0.05 (relaxed). The TMT reporter ion quantification used unique peptides only. The co-isolation threshold was set at 100%.  Peptides with an average reported signal: noise >3 were used for protein quantification. Only master proteins were reported. Protein abundance was normalised by equalising the total abundance between different runs/channels, and then scaled to an average of 100 across all samples.
