### Title
Cholesterol removal improves performance of a model biomimetic system to co-deliver a photothermal agent and a STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy

### Description
Biological membranes often play important functional roles in biomimetic drug delivery systems. We discover that the circulation time and targeting capability of biological membrane-coated nanovehicles can be significantly improved by reducing cholesterol level in the coating membrane. A proof-of-concept system using cholesterol-reduced and PD-1-overexpressed T cell membrane to deliver a photothermal agent and a STING agonist is thus fabricated. Comparing with normal membrane, this engineered membrane increases tumor accumulation by ~2-fold. On melanoma mice model, tumors are eliminated with no recurrence in >80% mice after intravenous injection and laser irradiation; while on colon cancer mice model, ~40% mice are cured without laser irradiation. Data suggest that the engineered membranes escape immune surveillance to avoid blood clearance while keeping functional surface molecules exposed. In summary, we develop a simple, effective, safe and widely-applicable biological membrane modification strategy. This “subtractive” strategy displays unique advantages and is worth further development.

### Sample Protocol
Serum of male C57BL/6 mice (18 ± 2 g, 6–8 weeks) was collected, and 0.3 mL of serum was mixed with 0.1 mL of nCISP or CISP, and incubated in 37 ℃ for 0.5 h. Then centrifuged at 20000 × g for 30 min to separate nCISP and CISP, washed them with cold PBS twice. The sample was extracted using SDT (4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6,0.1 M DTT) lysis method for protein extraction, and then protein quantification was performed using BCA method. Take an appropriate amount of protein from each sample and use the Filter Aided Protein Preparation (FASP) method for trypsin enzymatic hydrolysis. Then, use C18 Cartridge to desalinate the hydrolyzed peptide segments, freeze dry the peptide segments, and add 40 μ L Solution buffer re dissolution, peptide quantification (OD280). Each graded sample was separated using a nanoliter flow rate HPLC liquid phase system, Easy nLC. Buffer solution: Solution A is a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, while Solution B is a 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (84% acetonitrile). The chromatographic column is equilibrated with 95% liquid A. The sample is loaded onto the Thermo scientific EASY column (100um * 2 cm, 5 um, C18) using an automatic sampler, and then analyzed on the Thermo scientific EASY column (75 μ M * 10 cm, 3 μ m. C18) Separation, with a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The relevant liquid phase gradient is as follows: from 0 min to 50 min, the linear gradient of liquid B ranges from 0% to 35%; From 50 minutes to 58 minutes, the linear gradient of liquid B ranges from 35% to 100%; Maintain liquid B at 100% for 58 to 60 minutes.  After chromatographic separation, the sample was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with a duration of 60 minutes. The detection method was positive ions, with a scanning range of 300-1800 m/z for the parent ion. The primary mass spectrometry resolution was 70000 at m/z 200, the AGC (Automatic gain control) target was 3e6, the Maximum IT was 10 ms, and the dynamic exclusion time was 40.0 s. The mass charge ratio of peptides and peptide fragments was collected using the following method: 10 fragments (MS2 scans) were collected after each full scan, with S2 Activation Type as HCD, Isolation window as 2 m/z, secondary mass spectrometry resolution of 17500 at 200 m/z, Normalized collection energy as 30 eV, Underfill ratio as 0.1%.

### Data Protocol
The raw file for mass spectrometry testing was retrieved from the corresponding database using Maxquant software (version 2.5.1) to obtain protein identification and quantitative analysis results.
