### Title
Plasma factors mediating inhibition of LDL oxidation

### Description
MS identification of proteins that change with various lipid removal treatments from plasma to be compared with ability to inhibit LDL oxidation

### Sample Protocol
Plasma samples were size fractionated.  Resulting fractions were delipdated and prepared for MS analysis using trypsin.  MS analysis was performed on a nanoLC-MS/MS Triple TOF mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mascot (version 2.2.2) and X! Tande,m (version 2001.01.01.1) search engines were used to identify proteins and were searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Knowledgebase using human taxonomy. Carbamidomehtylation was a variable modification, peptide tolerance was set to +/- 20 ppm and MS/MS tolerance set to +/- 0.6 Da.  Up to 3 missed trypsin cleavages were allowed.  Scaffold software was used for validation of peptide and protein identification.
