### Title
Human MLI metaproteome -  MetaPro-IQ: a universal metaproteomic approach to studying human and mouse gut microbiota

### Description
Human mucosal-luminal interface (MLI) samples were collected from 8 different children and bacterial cells were harvest for metaproteomic analysis for understanding the MLI microbiota functions.

### Sample Protocol
The bacterial cells were collected with centrifugation and lysed with 4%SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data were search against gut microbiome database with a final quantification with MaxQuant.
