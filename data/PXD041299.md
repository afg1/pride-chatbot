### Title
Proteome analysis of TRANSLOCON OF THE OUTER CHLOROPLAST membrane 75 (TOC75) knockdown mutants

### Description
Artificial microRNA mutants of Toc75 were generated in Arabidopsis. Shotgun proteomics was with Col-0 and two independent knockdown lines.

### Sample Protocol
Proteome analysis was performed using total protein extracts isolated from three-week old leaf material (four biological replicates). Protein preparation, trypsin digestion, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) were performed as described previously (Marino et al., 2019).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using the MaxQuant software version 2.1.3.0 (Cox and Mann, 2008). Peak lists were searched against the Arabidopsis reference proteome (Uniprot, www.uniprot.org, version April 2021) using the built‐in Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) with default settings and ‘mach-between-runs’ was enabled. Proteins were quantified using the label‐free quantification algorithm (LFQ) (Cox et al., 2014).
