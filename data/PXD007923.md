### Title
Moss Physcomitrella paten endogenous peptides, LC-MS/MS, part 2

### Description
Short (<100 codons) open reading frames (sORFs) are  common features of all genomes. Proof of translation of sORFs is an important step towards finding of functional sORF-encoded peptides (SEPs). We verified translation of our predicted sORFs using mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis which is often considered as the gold standard in detection of proteins or peptides in cell. Taking into account the shortage of proteomic methods in identifying small proteins or peptides, in our study we used “peptidomic” dataset - endogenous peptides, extracted from three types of moss cells – gametophores, protonemata and protoplasts

### Sample Protocol
Endogenous peptide extraction was conducted as described previously (Fesenko et al, 2015). Mass-spectrometry analysis on a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer with NanoSpray III ion source (ABSciex, Framingham, MA 01701, USA) coupled with a NanoLC Ultra 2D+ nano-HPLC system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA, USA) was performed as described earlier (Fesenko et al, 2016).

### Data Protocol
Dataset was searched with MaxQuant v1.5.8.3 against a custom database containing the protein sequences from Phytozome v12.0 merged with chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins, database of common contaminant proteins and the set of predicted sORFs. MaxQuant’s protein FDR filter was disabled, while 1% FDR was used to select high-confidence PSMs (peptide spectrum matches) and ambiguous peptides were filtered out. Parameter “Digestion Mode” was set as ‘unspecific’ and modifications were not allowed. All other parameters were left at default values

### Publication Abstract
Genomes contain millions of short (&lt;100 codons) open reading frames (sORFs), which are usually dismissed during gene annotation. Nevertheless, peptides encoded by such sORFs can play important biological roles, and their impact on cellular processes has long been underestimated. Here, we analyzed approximately 70,000 transcribed sORFs in the model plant <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> (moss). Several distinct classes of sORFs that differ in terms of their position on transcripts and the level of evolutionary conservation are present in the moss genome. Over 5000 sORFs were conserved in at least one of 10 plant species examined. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteomic and peptidomic data sets suggested that tens of sORFs located on distinct parts of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are translated, including conserved sORFs. Translational analysis of the sORFs and main ORFs at a single locus suggested the existence of genes that code for multiple proteins and peptides with tissue-specific expression. Functional analysis of four lncRNA-encoded peptides showed that sORFs-encoded peptides are involved in regulation of growth and differentiation in moss. Knocking out lncRNA-encoded peptides resulted in a decrease of moss growth. In contrast, the overexpression of these peptides resulted in a diverse range of phenotypic effects. Our results thus open new avenues for discovering novel, biologically active peptides in the plant kingdom.
