### Title
Identification of UFM-1 binding proteins LC-MS/MS

### Description
UFM-1 binding proteins were identified by mass spectroscopic analysis

### Sample Protocol
For identification of UFM-1 binding proteins, HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG tagged UFM-1 and/or UFL1, UFBP1 mock protein expression plasmid was lysed with lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4 and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (ROCHE)) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (M8823; Sigma-Aldrich). Precipitated immunocomplexes were washed three times in washing buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and eluted with FLAG peptides. The samples obtained were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The resulting pellets were dissolved in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.8) containing 7 M guanidine hydrochloride, reduced using 5 mM TCEP (tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and subsequently alkylated using 10 mM iodoacetamide. After alkylation, samples were digested with lysyl-endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for 3 h at 37°C and then further digested with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 14 h at 37°C.

### Data Protocol
All MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot Server v.2.3 search engine (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) using the NCBI nonredundant human protein data set (NCBInr RefSeq Release 71, containing 179460 entries).
