### Title
Proteomics investigation of the time course responses of RAW264.7 macrophages to infections with the wild-type and twin-arginine translocation mutant strains of Brucella melitensis

### Description
Brucella, a notorious intracellular pathogen, causes chronic infections in many mammals, including humans. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane; protein substrates translocated by Brucella include ABC transporters, oxidoreductases, and cell envelope biosynthesis proteins. Previously, we showed that a Tat mutant of Brucella melitensis M28 exhibits reduced survival within murine macrophages. In this study, we compared the host responses elicited by wild-type M28 and its Tat-mutant strains ex vivo. We utilized label-free quantitative proteomics to assess proteomic changes in RAW264.7 macrophages after infection with M28 and its Tat mutants.

### Sample Protocol
RAW264.7 (ATCC) murine macrophage cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) without antibiotics and was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The detailed procedures for infecting the macrophages with B. melitensis M28 and M28ΔtatA were described previously (Yan et al., 2020). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells (3×106 cells per well) were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates and inoculated with bacterial culture diluted in DMEM (5% FBS) at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 100:1. After a 10-min centrifugation at 250×g, the plates were placed in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the cells were washed with DMEM three times and incubated in DMEM (5% FBS) containing 5 g/mL gentamicin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the indicated times. After 4 h, 24 h and 48 h, cells were collected, washed three times with ice-cold PBS and processed for label-free quantitative mass proteomic analysis.

### Data Protocol
All MS raw files from the same batch were processed with MaxQuant (v1.6.6.0) and searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus protein database (version 2019.11, 17,032 sequences) concatenated with the reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as a cleavage enzyme and up to 2 missed cleavages and 5 modifications per peptide were allowed. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 40 ppm for the first search and 40 ppm for the main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.04 Da. Carbamidomethylation on Cys was specified as a fixed modification and oxidation on Met and acetylation on the protein N-terminus were specified as variable modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to 7 residues. The false discovery rates (FDRs) of the peptides and proteins were set as 1%. InterProScan software was used to annotate the function of the proteins by Gene Ontology (GO, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) according to the protein sequence alignment method. Then, the proteins were classified based on the three GO annotation categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis was performed on the basis of the GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main) pathway analyses, and the corresponding functions and pathways with p < 0.05 (two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) were considered statistically significant.

### Publication Abstract
<i>Brucella</i>, a notorious intracellular pathogen, causes chronic infections in many mammals, including humans. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane; protein substrates translocated by <i>Brucella</i> include ABC transporters, oxidoreductases, and cell envelope biosynthesis proteins. Previously, we showed that a Tat mutant of <i>Brucella melitensis</i> M28 exhibits reduced survival within murine macrophages. In this study, we compared the host responses elicited by wild-type M28 and its Tat-mutant strains ex vivo. We utilized label-free quantitative proteomics to assess proteomic changes in RAW264.7 macrophages after infection with M28 and its Tat mutants. A total of 6085 macrophage proteins were identified with high confidence, and 79, 50, and 99 proteins were differentially produced upon infection with the Tat mutant at 4, 24, and 48 hpi, respectively, relative to the wild-type infection. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that immune response-related proteins were enriched among the upregulated proteins. Compared to the wild-type M28 infection, the most upregulated proteins upon Tat-mutant infection included the cytosolic nucleic acid signaling pathway-related proteins IFIH1, DHX58, IFI202, IFI204, and ISG15 and the NF-<i>&#x3ba;</i>B signaling pathway-related proteins PTGS2, CD40, and TRAF1, suggesting that the host increases the production of these proteins in response to Tat mutant infection. Upregulation of some proteins was further verified by a parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay. ELISA and qRT-PCR assays indicated that Tat mutant infection significantly induced proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO) production. Finally, we showed that the Tat mutant displays higher sensitivity to nitrosative stress than the wild type and that treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA significantly increases the intracellular survival of the Tat mutant, indicating that NO production contributes to restricting Tat mutant survival within macrophages. Collectively, this work improves our understanding of host immune responses to Tat mutants and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the attenuated virulence of Tat mutants.
