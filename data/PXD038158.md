### Title
MOSPD2-Toxoplasma Immunoprecipitation

### Description
IP-MS experiments to identify MOSPD2 interacting partners at the Toxoplasma PVM

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed in NP40 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. Samples were sput at 10k g to remove insoluble material. Lysates wer incubate with anti-V5 nanobodies and washed 10 times with NP40.

### Data Protocol
Peptide spectra assignments and protein inferences were performed using Byonic v4.2.4. assuming fully-specific tryptic digestion, as well as common modifications asuch as methionine oxidation and cysteine alkylation
