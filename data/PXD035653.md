### Title
Non-enzymatic acetylation inhibits glycolytic enzymes in Escherichia coli

### Description
Here we investigate the role of acetyl phosphate-mediated acetylation in E. coli central metabolism. Out of 19 enzymes investigated from central metabolsim, only GapA and GpmA were acetylated at high stoichiometry.

### Sample Protocol
The N-terminally His-tagged enzymes (dataset S1) were overexpressed from the ASKA library and purified prior to incubation with 1 mM AcP for 1 hour at 37Â°C and pH of 7.2. Purified proteins were analyzed individually with intact protein mass spectrometry on an orbitrap hf-x operated in positive mode and connected inline to a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC system.

### Data Protocol
.raw files were deconvoluted to neutral masses at the precursor level using UniDec, or at the MS2 fragmentation level using the Xtract algorithm as part of the Freestyle software package
