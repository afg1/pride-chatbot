### Title
Dataset of proteins of mouse macrophage cell line PMJ2R samples infected with Tick-borne encephalitis virus, strain Hypr original isolate  (part 2)

### Description
Dataset for a comparative analysis of protein profiles of three series of mouse macrophage cell line PMJ2R samples including infected with Tick-borne encephalitis virus, strain Hypr original isolate on the second (H2) and sixth day (H6) after infection was carried out using shotgun ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
PMJ2R cells were infected with TBEV (strain Hypr) for 2 and 6 days. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis was carried out using Q Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 Nano-flow HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)

### Data Protocol
- Cell lysis followed by protein precipitation. - Digestion of proteins. - LC-MS/MS analysis.
