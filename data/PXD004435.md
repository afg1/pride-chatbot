### Title
Transcription factor-SNP interactome for colorectal cancer risk loci

### Description
A core task to understand the consequences of non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) is to identify their genotype specific binding of transcription factor (TF). Here, we generate a large-scale TF-SNP interaction map for a selection of 116 colorectal cancer (CRC) risk loci and validated TF binding to 10 putatively functional SNPs. Our data further revealed TF binding complexity adjacent to the 116 risk loci, adding an additional layer of understanding to regulatory networks associated with CRC relevant loci.

### Sample Protocol
High throughput DNA pull-down experiments was performed on 96-well filter plate format using our published method (Hubner et al. 2015) with minor modifications. To synthesize biotinylated dsDNA oligo, we attached a non-genomic 15 bp sequence at the 3' end of the anti-sense strands. Subsequently, a reverse complement biotinylated primer was used to extend single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates into dsDNA oligos. For each synthesis, 150 pmol of the biotinylated primer and 200 pmol template were subjected to a PCR reaction using Herculase II Fusion Enzyme kit under the following conditions: 95oC for 3 min; thermocycling (n=20) at 95oC for 1 min, 45oC for 1 min and 72oC for 1 min; 72oC for 3 min; infinite hold at 12oC. Two-hundred fifty µg nuclear extracts and 15 µg of competitors (5 µg of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic) acid sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, P4929), poly(deoxyadenylic-thymidylic) acid sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, P0883) and Bakers yeast RNA (Sigma-Aldrich, R6750)) were added for each of the pull-down experiments. The components of the competitors were sonicated into ~300 bp fragments prior to use. The pull-down duplicates underwent dimethyl label swapping and measured by nLC-MS/MS in a 2h gradient.

### Data Protocol
Recorded MS files were analyzed by MaxQuant software (version 1.3.5.7) (Cox and Mann 2008) using standard settings for dimethyl or label-free quantification analysis. All the files were searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human database (generated from version 06-2012).
