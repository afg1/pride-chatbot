### Title
NleB2 from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is an arginine-glucose transferase

### Description
Within this study we demostrate that NleB2 from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is a arginine-glucose transferase. Using in vitro and in vivo assays we demostrate that control of the utelisation of UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-Glc is controlled by a single amino acid.

### Sample Protocol
In vitro and in vivo generated samples of RIPK1_DD were digested with GluC and cleaned up using C18 stage tip prior to being analyzed on either a QE+ or a Fusion Lumos. For the determination of self glycosylation of NleB2 samples were digested with LycC and analyzed as above.

### Data Protocol
Data was anlyzed using Maxquant with the resulting modified peptides manually inspected to ensure correctness.
