### Title
High-density chemical cross-linking for modeling protein interactions

### Description
We combine several orthogonal cross-linking chemistries as well as improvements in search algorithms, statistical analysis and computational cost to achieve coverage of one unique cross-linked position pair for every 7 amino acids at a 1% false discovery rate. This is accomplished without any peptide-level fractionation, enrichment, or isotopic labeling. We apply our methods to model the complex between a carbonic anhydrase (CA) and its protein inhibitor, as well as the yeast proteasome

### Sample Protocol
Samples were cross-linked using EDC/sNHS, E-EDC/sNHS, and BS3, digested and analyzed by LC/MS, with hi-res HCD MS2 triggering on charge states 3 and higher.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using XL search algorithm and filtered to 1% FDR on unique peptide level. (Mintseris and Gygi, submitted)
