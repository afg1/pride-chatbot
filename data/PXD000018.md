### Title
Proteomic analysis of integrin adhesion complex-mediated mechanotransduction

### Description
Integrin adhesion complexes were isolated from mouse fibroblasts treated with or without blebbistatin. Adhesion complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, digested with trpysin and analysed by LC-MS/MS using an LTQ Velos mass spectrometer
