### Title
NRF2 activation in TRP53:P16 deficient mice drives oral squamous cell carcinoma

### Description
NRF2 activation in TRP53:P16 deficient mice drives oral squamous cell carcinoma

### Sample Protocol
Specimens were deparaffinized using Xylenes and sequential ethanol washes, extracted in a lysis buffer of 2,2,2-trifuoroethanol (TFE) and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 50% (v/v), and then digested using Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Chemicals, 12902541) and trypsin (Promega, PR-V5113). Peptides were desalted by SDB-RPS spin columns (Affinisep, Spin-RPS-M.T1.96) and quantified by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 23225).

### Data Protocol
The Thermo Scientific Instrument Application Programming Interface was used to control dynamic switching of FAIMS CVs throughout each run. Peak area ratios and chromatogram plots for IS-PRM data were generated using an in-house tool available on github (https://github.com/nwamsley1/AutoPRM.jl).
