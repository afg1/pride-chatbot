### Title
STXBP5 prevents reannealing of autophagic cis-SNARE disassembled by NSF/αSNAP

### Description
We generated a HEK293 cell line expressing ZZ-TEV-FLAG-bait protein by Lipofectamine 3000 transfection. The expression level of bait protein is controlled to endogenous level by addition of 2 ng/mL doxycycline. Note the combined treatment of Torin1 and CQ was applied for STX17. The tandem affinity purification of tagged bait protein was performed in a physiology buffer condition [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. The eluted protein mixtures were subjected to SDS/PAGE and further analyzed by mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel were de-stained and in-gel digested with sequencing grade trypsin overnight at 37 degree. Peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid/50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid/75% acetonitrile sequentially and then concentrated to ~ 20 μl. The extracted peptides were separated by an analytical capillary column (50 μm x 10 cm) packed with 5 μm spherical C18 reversed phase material. A Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system was used to generate the following HPLC gradient: 0-30% B in 60 min, 30-70% B in 15 min (A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The eluted peptides were sprayed into a LTQ ORBITRAP Velos mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-ESI ion source. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with one MS scan followed by four CID(Collision Induced Dissociation) and four HCD (High-energy Collisional Dissociation) MS/MS scans for each cycle.

### Data Protocol
Database searches were performed on an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) against IPI (International Protein Index) human protein database. The search parameters are: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.7 Da mass tolerance for product ions; two missed cleavage sites were allowed for trypsin digestion. Methionine oxidation was set as variable modification. The search results were filtered with both peptide significance threshold and expectation value to be below 0.05. Mascot version:2.6.0.
