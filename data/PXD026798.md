### Title
Strategies for the interpretation of soil metaproteomic data

### Description
Evaluation of different strategies to interpret metaproteomics data acquired on soil samples from a floodplain along the Seine River (France) incorporating sample-specific metagenomics data, soil genome catalogue database, and generic sequence database.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT using generic and sample-specific metagenomics databases at FDR 1%.
