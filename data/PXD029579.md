### Title
Biotin-13-cis retinoic acid pulldown LC-MSMS

### Description
We performed pulldown assays followed by mass-spectrometry analysis using biotin-tagged 13-cis retinoic acid to identify its binding targets in HeLa cells

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples from in vivo biotin pulldown assay were separated by SDS-PAGE gel then stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad). The whole bands were cut down and digested with trypsin. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an Easy-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo) coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo) via a nano-electrospray ion source.

### Data Protocol
Raw file was searched against the human National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Refseq protein database in Proteome Discoverer 2.1 suited with Mascot software (version 2.3.1, Matrix Science) to achieve a false discovery rate of <1%. The mass tolerance was set to be 20â€‰ppm for precursor, and it was set 50 mmu for the tolerance of product ions.
