### Title
A COMPREHENSIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE INSIGHT INTO THE PROTEOMES OF ARTICULAR CARTILAGE AND SUBCHONDRAL BONE

### Description
In this study, we used two workflows based on either pressure cycling technology (PCT) or ultrasonication (US) in combination with data independent acquisition (DIA) based mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to quantitatively assess the proteomes of articular cartilage and subchondral bone.

### Sample Protocol
First, a spectral library was established covering joint related tissue and synovial fluid based on samples from nine horses. To ensure a spectral library covering a broad spectrum of proteins related to the joint and embracing proteins potentially favored by various preparation and analysis steps, the spectral library included repository data dependent acquisition (DDA) based MS data from analysis of samples prepared by a combination of different disruption, denaturing, and desalting steps and analyzed using two different mass spectrometer settings. Secondly, articular cartilage and subchondral bone from the fetlock of three biological replicates, each in three technical replicates, were independently homogenized by PCT and US, extracted proteins denatured with guanidine hydrochloride, protein disulphide bonds reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine and alkylated with iodoacetamide followed by digestion with first Lys-C and then trypsin. The SOLAμ vacuum manifold and solid phase extraction (SPE) micro elution method was used to desalt the samples before separation on an EASY-nLC™ 1200 liquid chromatography system followed by DIA-MS analysis on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadropole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The software Spectronaut was used to generate the spectral library from Pulsar with the equine proteome from Uniprot as reference database. False discovery rate was controlled at 1 % for both precursor and protein group levels.
