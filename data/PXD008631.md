### Title
Immunoaffinity enrichemt of GREB1 to co-enrich HSP90

### Description
Immunoaffinity enrichemt of GREB1 to co-enrich HSP90

### Sample Protocol
MCF-7 lysate was incubated with 17-AAG or verhicle. Immunoprecipitation of GREB1 and subsequent elution of enriched proteins. Labeling of the different conditions with TMT label and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis was performed using an in-house pipeline and searched with Mascot 2.5

### Publication Abstract
Protein degradation plays important roles in biological processes and is tightly regulated. Further, targeted proteolysis is an emerging research tool and&#xa0;therapeutic strategy. However, proteome-wide technologies to investigate the causes and consequences of protein degradation in biological systems are lacking. We developed "multiplexed proteome dynamics profiling" (mPDP), a mass-spectrometry-based approach combining dynamic-SILAC labeling with isobaric mass tagging for multiplexed analysis of protein degradation and synthesis. In three proof-of-concept studies, we uncover different responses induced by the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 versus a JQ1 proteolysis targeting chimera; we&#xa0;elucidate distinct modes of action of estrogen receptor modulators; and we comprehensively classify HSP90 clients based on their requirement for HSP90 constitutively or during synthesis, demonstrating that constitutive HSP90 clients have lower thermal stability than non-clients, have higher affinity&#xa0;for the chaperone, vary between cell types, and change upon external stimuli. These findings highlight the potential of mPDP to identify dynamically controlled degradation mechanisms in cellular systems.
