### Title
Large-scale LC-MS/MS identifiection of interactors of the Arabidopsis plant natriuretic peptide, AtPNP-A

### Description
Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) are systemically mobile peptidic hormones regulating solute and water homeostasis. Since the molecular mode of their action is elusive, we performed a large-scale protein-protein interaction study to identify putative interactors of AtPNP-A - the model PNP present in Arabidopsis thaliana.

### Sample Protocol
Affinity-based isolation of interactors of AtPNP-A was performed with the use of protein extracted from leaf tissue of the wild type A. thaliana (Col-0). Protein extract was incubated either with the biologically active N-terminally biotinylated synthetic peptide (pAtPNP-A), corresponding to the active site of AtPNP-A, or with equimolar amount of biologically inactive N-terminally biotinylated scrambled peptide (control). The complexes were isolated with Dynabeads M-280 (Life Technologies), and the eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue,and the bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion of proteins with trypsin. MS analyses of the resulting tryptic peptides were performed on linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)

### Data Protocol
Data were recorded with the Xcalibur software version 2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and converted from '.raw' to '.mgf' with Proteome Discoverer version 1.2.0.208 (Thermo Scientific). All spectra were submitted to a local MASCOT (Matrix Science) and SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific) servers and searched against A. thaliana in the TAIR database (release 10), with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da, and strict trypsin specificity allowing up to one missed cleavage, carbamidomethyl modification on cysteine residues as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine residues and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues as variable modifications. Identified proteins were all evaluated and quantified using Scaffold Q+ software (Proteome Software)

### Publication Abstract
Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) are a group of systemically acting peptidic hormones affecting solute and solvent homeostasis and responses to biotrophic pathogens. Although an increasing body of evidence suggests PNPs modulate plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress, which could lead to their potential biotechnological application by conferring increased stress tolerance to plants, the exact mode of PNPs action is still elusive. In order to gain insight into PNP-dependent signalling, we set out to identify interactors of PNP present in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, termed AtPNP-A. Here, we report identification of rubisco activase (RCA), a central regulator of photosynthesis converting Rubisco catalytic sites from a closed to an open conformation, as an interactor of AtPNP-A through affinity isolation followed by mass spectrometric identification. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses reveals that the full-length recombinant AtPNP-A and the biologically active fragment of AtPNP-A bind specifically to RCA, whereas a biologically inactive scrambled peptide fails to bind. These results are considered in the light of known functions of PNPs, PNP-like proteins, and RCA in biotic and abiotic stress responses.
