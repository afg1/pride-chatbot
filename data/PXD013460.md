### Title
Sex and age specific adaptations of the hippocampal proteome to early-life stress

### Description
An established limited-bedding paradigm was used to induce early-life stress in mouse pups. The hippocampus was harvested at postnatal day 21 and from adults and a non-nuclear fraction prepared for quantitative proteomic analyses using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ).

### Sample Protocol
Lysates were digested and labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and quantitative analyses were performed following 2D LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were searched against a database containing the Mus musculus subset of the UniprotKB protein database using Spectrum Mill (Agilent).  Excel files containing protein-level information include quantified proteins after applying FDR thresholds using Spectrum Mill autovalidation (<1% FDR) and after filtering to include proteins that were identified with at least 2 unique peptides.
