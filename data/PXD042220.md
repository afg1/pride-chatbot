### Title
Discovery of a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor that harnesses the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling without CNS-mediated adverse side effects or physical dependence.

### Description
Chemical proteomics of LEI-515 in mouse lung, liver and brain tissue to assess the selectivity of the inhibitor.

### Sample Protocol
The lysate was incubated with LEI-515 and subsequently with FP-biotin and THL-biotin. The proteins were precipitated with CHCl3 and MeOH. Enrichment was done using high capacity streptavidin beads. The peptides were obtained using trypsin digestion and analysed by LCMS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed with MAXQuant software. The following cut-offs were used for target identification: unique peptides ≥ 1, identified peptides ≥ 2, ratio LEI-515-treated over vehicle-treated ≥ 2 with q-value < 0.05 based on t-test. Serine hydrolase annotation according to Uniprot Database.
