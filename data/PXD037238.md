### Title
ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification by targeting G9A/GLP-mediated heterochromatin to silence enhancers

### Description
ZNF462 haploinsufficiency is linked to Weiss-Kruszka Syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental defects including Autism. Though conserved in vertebrates and essential for embryonic development the molecular functions of ZNF462 remain unclear. We identified its murine homolog ZFP462 in a screen for mediators of epigenetic gene silencing. Here, we show that ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by targeting the H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase complex G9A/GLP to silence mesoendodermal genes. ZFP462 binds to transposable elements (TEs) that are potential enhancers harboring ESC-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Recruiting G9A/GLP, ZFP462 seeds heterochromatin, restricting TF binding. Loss of ZFP462 in ESCs results in increased chromatin accessibility at target sites and ectopic expression of mesoendodermal genes. Taken together, ZFP462 confers lineage- and locus-specificity to the broadly expressed epigenetic regulator G9A/GLP. Our results suggest that aberrant activation of lineage non-specific genes in the neuronal lineage underlies ZNF462-associated neurodevelopmental pathology.

### Sample Protocol
Protein Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)  Cells were grown to confluency on 15cm plates, collected in PBS, pelleted by 3 min centrifugation at 300g. For each Co-IP, 30 million equivalent cell pellets were then resuspended in 5ml of buffer 1 (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche)), incubated for 20 min at 4°C followed by a centrifugation step. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche)), incubated for 10 min at 4°C followed by centrifugation. Isolated nuclei were lysed in buffer 3 (50mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.3, 200mM KCl, 3.2mM MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.25% NP-40, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate and 1mM DTT and Roche Complete protease inhibitor), 4ul of Benzonase (E1014, Millipore) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C.  The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C with Tag specific magnetic beads (Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin/Invitrogen for immunoprecipitation of Avitag-ZFP462 and Avitag-GLP. Anti-FLAG® M2 magnetic beads/Sigma for immunoprecipitation of TetR-3xFLAG-CT-ZFP462). The beads were washed four times for 10 min with buffer 4 (50mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.3, 300mM KCl, 3.2mM MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.25% NP-40, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate and 1mM DTT). Beads are further washed four times with Tris buffer (20mM Tris pH7.5, 137mM Nacl)  and used for mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
For volcano plot generation the log2 ratio between sample and control were plotted against -log10 of adjusted P-value with imputation, with at least 3 biological replicates were included. Selected proteins were highlighted in the volcano plot.

### Publication Abstract
ZNF462 haploinsufficiency is linked to Weiss-Kruszka syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental defects, including autism. Though conserved in vertebrates and essential for embryonic development, the molecular functions of ZNF462 remain unclear. We identified its murine homologue ZFP462 in a screen for mediators of epigenetic gene silencing. Here we show that ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by targeting the H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase complex G9A/GLP to silence meso-endodermal genes. ZFP462 binds to transposable elements that are potential enhancers harbouring pluripotency and meso-endoderm transcription factor binding sites. Recruiting G9A/GLP, ZFP462 seeds heterochromatin, restricting transcription factor binding. Loss of ZFP462 in ESCs results in increased chromatin accessibility at target sites and ectopic expression of meso-endodermal genes. Taken together, ZFP462 confers lineage and locus specificity to the broadly expressed epigenetic regulator G9A/GLP. Our results suggest that aberrant activation of lineage non-specific genes in the neuronal lineage underlies ZNF462-associated neurodevelopmental pathology.
