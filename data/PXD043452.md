### Title
PARP14 is a PARP with both ADP-ribosyl transferase 1 and hydrolase activities

### Description
PARP14 is a mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase involved in the control of immunity, transcription and DNA replication stress management. However, little is known about the ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP14, including its substrate specificity or how PARP14-dependent ADP-ribosylation is reversed. Here we show that PARP14 is dual function enzyme with both ADP-ribosyl transferase and hydrolase activity acting on both protein and nucleic acid substrates. In particular, we show that the PARP14 macrodomain 1 is an active ADP-ribosyl hydrolase. We also demonstrate hydrolytic activity for the first macrodomain of PARP9. We reveal that expression of a PARP14 mutant with the inactivated macrodomain 1 results in a dramatic increase in mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins in human cells, including PARP14 itself and antiviral PARP13. Moreover, we demonstrate that the closely related hydrolytically active macrodomain of SARS2 Nsp3, Mac1, efficiently reverses PARP14 ADP-ribosylation in vitro and in cells, supporting the evolution of viral macrodomains to counteract PARP14-mediated antiviral response.

### Sample Protocol
HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin (100U/mL, Gibco). The cells were cultured as 5 technical replicates in a humidified incubator at 37° C with 5% CO2 in 15cm dishes. The cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for either YFP-PARP14 WT or YFP-PARP14 MD1 mutant sequences according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The cells were gently washed with PBS 24 hours after transfection, and then immediately lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1%Triton X-100) supplemented with 5mM MgCl2, 0.1% Benzonase (Sigma), protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), Olaparib (Cayman Chemical 2 μM for 293T cells), 1 μM PARGi PDD00017273 (Sigma) for 30 min at 4°C. Lysates were split evenly across either Af1521-linked glutathione sepharose 4B beads or empty control beads. The purification of the GST-Af1521 macrodomain was performed essentially as described previously (Anagho, H. A. et al., 2023). The beads was incubated with the lysates for 8 hours at 4° C tumbling end over end to facilitate binding between the ADP-ribosylated proteins and the Af1521 containing beads. After binding, the beads were transferred to new tubes 3 times and were washed 2 times after each tube change in RIPA buffer (described above) without supplements. Proteins were digested on-beads with RIPA buffer supplemented with 500ng of trypsin per sample, and incubated over night at 30° C with mild shake. To separate the peptides from the beads, samples were spun through a 0.45µM filter (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore), and then reduced and alkylated with 5mM TCEP and 5mM chloroacetamide for 30 minutes at RT. Peptides were subjected the StageTip cleanup by desalting and purifying them on C-18 discs at high pH. Briefly, quad-layer StageTips were prepared using four punch-outs of C18 material (Sigma-Aldrich, Empore SPE Disks, C18, 47 mm). StageTips were equilibrated using 100 ml of methanol, 100 ml of 80% acetonitille (ACN) in 200 mM ammonium hydroxide, and two times 75 ml 50 mM ammonium. Samples were supplemented with 1/10th volume of 200 mM ammonium hydroxide (pH >10), just prior to loading them on the StageTip. The StageTips were subsequently washed twice with 150 ml 50 mM ammonium hydroxide, and afterwards eluted using 80 ml of 30% ACN in 50 mM ammonium hydroxide. All samples were dried to completion in protein-LoBind tubes (Eppendorf), using a SpeedVac for 2h at 60° C, after which the dried peptides were dissolved using 11 ml of 0.1% formic acid, and stored at 20°C until MS analysis. MS samples were analyzed on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo) coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris™ 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Separation of peptides was performed using 20-cm columns (75 μm internal diameter) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm beads (Dr. Maisch). Elution of peptides from the column was achieved using a gradient ranging from buffer A (0.1% formic acid) to buffer B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid), at a flow of 250 nl/min. The gradient length was 80 min per sample, including ramp-up and wash-out, with an analytical gradient of 60 min ranging from 5 %B to 38 %B. Analytical columns were heated to 40°C using a column oven, and ionization was achieved using a NanoSpray Flex™ NG ion source. Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, ion transfer tube temperature to 275°C, and RF funnel level to 40%. Full scan range was set to 300-1,300 m/z, MS1 resolution to 120,000, MS1 AGC target to “200” (2,000,000 charges), and MS1 maximum injection time to “Auto”. Precursors with charges 2-6 were selected for fragmentation using an isolation width of 1.3 m/z, and fragmented using higher-energy collision disassociation (HCD) with normalized collision energy of 25. Precursors were excluded from re-sequencing by setting a dynamic exclusion of 80 s. MS2 resolution was set to 30,000, MS2 AGC target to “200” (200,000 charges), intensity threshold to 360,000 charges per second, MS2 maximum injection time to “Auto”, and TopN to 13.

### Data Protocol
All RAW files were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.30) using default settings, except with label-free quantification enabled. The human FASTA database used in this study was downloaded from Uniprot on the 25th of June, 2023 (UP000005640). All data was filtered by posterior error probability to achieve a false discovery rate of <1% (default), at both the peptide-spectrum match and the protein assignment levels.

### Publication Abstract
PARP14 is a mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase involved in the control of immunity, transcription, and DNA replication stress management. However, little is known about the ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP14, including its substrate specificity or how PARP14-dependent ADP-ribosylation is reversed. We show that PARP14 is a dual-function enzyme with both ADP-ribosyl transferase and hydrolase activity acting on both protein and nucleic acid substrates. In particular, we show that the PARP14 macrodomain 1 is an active ADP-ribosyl hydrolase. We also demonstrate hydrolytic activity for the first macrodomain of PARP9. We reveal that expression of a PARP14 mutant with the inactivated macrodomain 1 results in a marked increase in mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins in human cells, including PARP14 itself and antiviral PARP13, and displays specific cellular phenotypes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the closely related hydrolytically active macrodomain of SARS2 Nsp3, Mac1, efficiently reverses PARP14 ADP-ribosylation in vitro and in cells, supporting the evolution of viral macrodomains to counteract PARP14-mediated antiviral response.
