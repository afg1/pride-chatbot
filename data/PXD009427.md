### Title
Selective Transamination of N-Ends (STONE)

### Description
This study combined shotgun proteomics with selective transamination to identify proteins expressed by Jurkat T-cells in the resting state.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins extracted from resting Jurkat T-cells were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were selectively transaminated and then analysed by nLC-LTQ Oribtrap Elite (Thermo).

### Data Protocol
Orbitrap RAW data were converted to peak lists by Mascot Distiller, which were then searched against the Swiss-Prot database (taxonomy = human). Variable modifications include transamination at peptide N-termini.
