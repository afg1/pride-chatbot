### Title
Community detection from empirical kinase networks identifies new members of signalling pathways

### Description
We use phosphorylation sites to quantify the enrichment of kinase-kinase relationships in response to diferent kinase inhibitors, from which we construct weighted kinase networks, and assess whether the application of community detection algorithms to such networks can provide new insights on the inner workings of canonical signalling pathways

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed in 8 M urea buffer. This concentration was reduced to 2 M with 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0) and proteins were digested with trypsin. Peptide solutions were desalted using Oasis-HLB cartridges and phosphopeptides enriched using TiO2.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using Mascot. Label-free quantification was performed using Pescal, a in-house developed software that uses extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for all the peptides identified in at least one sample across all samples
