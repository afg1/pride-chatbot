### Title
Quantitative analysis of temporal IP and cell lysate using SWATH-MS (2)

### Description
We treated wildtype and RIP3 knockout L929 with TNF for 8 time points respectively, and used SWATH-MS to quantify dynamic proteomic change of these two cell lines under a serial TNF treatments.

### Sample Protocol
L929 cell lysates were denatured in 8M urea/50 mM NH4HCO3. After cysteine reduction and alkylation, 8M urea was diluted to 1.6 M, and trypsin was added in the samples for digestion overnight.

### Data Protocol
Wiff files were converted to mzML using AB Sciex MS converter, and then converted to mzXML files using proteoWizard MSConvert. These mzXML files were used for DIA-Umpire analysis. Wiff files were converted to mzXML files using proteoWizard MSConvert for OpenSWATH analysis.
