### Title
Environmental stress affects the activity of metabolic and growth factor signaling networks and induces autophagy markers in breast cancer cell lines

### Description
The breast cancer cell line MCF7 was exposed to RT comditions for 15min, 2h or left in the incubator. Cells were harvested and lyzed. Samples were digested with trypsin and subjected to phosphoenrichment usin TiO2. Phosphopeptides were run in a LTQ-Orbitrap-XL. 4 biological replicates per condition were done. Peaks lists were generated with Mascot Distiller (version 2.3) in MGF format and Database searches were with Mascot Server (version 2.3) against the SwissProt database restricted to human sequences (release October 2012) and trypsin cleavage. Restrictions were 7ppm for parent ions and 0.8 Da for fragment masses. Allowed modifications were phosphorylation of Ser/Thr/Tyr, pyro-Glu (N-term) and methionine oxidation and one miss-cleavage allowed. Quantification was by label-free using peak heights of extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) constructed with narrow mass windows (7ppm) and time windows (1.5 minutes). Pescal, a computer program written in house, was used to automate the generation of XICs and to calculate peak heights.

### Publication Abstract
Phosphoproteomic techniques are contributing to our understanding of how signaling pathways interact and regulate biological processes. This technology is also being used to characterize how signaling networks are remodeled during disease progression and to identify biomarkers of signaling pathway activity and of responses to cancer therapy. A potential caveat in these studies is that phosphorylation is a very dynamic modification that can substantially change during the course of an experiment or the retrieval and processing of cellular samples. Here, we investigated how exposure of cells to ambient conditions modulates phosphorylation and signaling pathway activity in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. About 1.5% of 3,500 sites measured showed a significant change in phosphorylation extent upon exposure of cells to ambient conditions for 15 min. The effects of this perturbation in modifying phosphorylation patterns did not involve random changes due to stochastic activation of kinases and phosphatases. Instead, exposure of cells to ambient conditions elicited an environmental stress reaction that involved a coordinated response to a metabolic stress situation, which included: (1) the activation of AMPK; (2) the inhibition of PI3K, AKT, and ERK; (3) an increase in markers of protein synthesis inhibition at the level of translation elongation; and (4) an increase in autophagy markers. We also observed that maintaining cells in ice modified but did not completely abolish this metabolic stress response. In summary, exposure of cells to ambient conditions affects the activity of signaling networks previously implicated in metabolic and growth factor signaling. Mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000472.
