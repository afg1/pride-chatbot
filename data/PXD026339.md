### Title
Trypanosoma cruzi H2B.V pulldown

### Description
Analysis of interactors of H2B.V and H2B of T. cruzi using samples from epimastigotes and cellular trypomastigotes.

### Sample Protocol
Recombinant histones tagged with His were obtained and used to retrieve interactors using a NiTA resin.Proteins were digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-MS/MS using an Orbitrap Velos.

### Data Protocol
The data in * .raw format were processed using the Andromeda-MaxQuant program [79] using TriTrypDB (T. cruzi taxonomy - obtained from http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/). Database searches were performed using the following parameters: carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification; oxidation of methionine, N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications; tolerance MS1 of 6 ppm and MS2 of 0.5 Da, and 1% FDR. The ProteinGroups.txt output were sequentially processed using the Perseus program [79]. Proteins with LFQ-intensity values equal to zero were considered absent. Proteins considered by MaxQuant as contaminants, presented at the reverse database, and identified only by a modified peptide, were removed. For pulldown analysis, we also removed: proteins presented (LFQ value > 0) in only one of the 3 biological replicates; proteins whose ratio of LFQ values from experimental sample (EpiH2B, TripoH2B, EpiH2BV and TripoH2BV) and control sample (Control_Epi, Control_TCT) were lower than 1.5 (to ensure that eluted protein was enriched on pulldown assay over the control samples); common contaminant proteins (ribosomal, cytoskeleton, heat-shock and metabolic proteins). Finally, we only considered proteins that were present at a previous chromatin study [34] and those whose T. brucei protein orthologs were located at nucleus/chromatin according to TrypTag.
