### Title
Quantitative acetyl-proteome profiling of Camellia sinensis cv.‘Anji Baicha’ during periodic albinism reveal lysine acetylation of proteins involved in photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways

### Description
The tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is often commercially used as a source of non-alcoholic beverages and is an economically important woody crop (Chen et al., 2007). As living standards have improved, the requirement for high-quality life has increased in modern society. ‘Anji Baicha’ (alias ‘Baiye 1’ or ‘White Leaf 1’) is an excellent tea cultivar with albino phenotype and it is popular in producing high-quality green tea. The traits of ‘Anji Baicha’ are as follows. Young ‘Anji Baicha’ shoots are yellow-green when the early spring temperature is below  20°C. As the leaves fully expand, the leaves become white. The leaves gradually  return to green when the environmental temperature increases (Cheng et al., 1999; Li et al., 2002, 2011). Previous reports have suggested a positive correlation between amino acid concentration and albinism as well as a negative correlation between tea polyphenols and albinism (Li et al., 1996; Du et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2013). Therefore, the quality of ‘Anji Baicha’ is much higher when new shoots become albino due to their rich amino acid content and modest tea polyphenol content. Plants adjust their metabolism in response to environmental stimuli to eventually bring about changes in protein activities and levels, and this adaptive process includes posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) (Prabakaran et al., 2012). PTMs have been reported to regulate various processes, including DNA interaction,  protein-protein interactions, enzyme activation and protein stability. Among the hundreds of different PTMs, lysine acetylation is an abundant, reversible and highly regulated PTM (Zhang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2011).

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction was performed using the method involving trichloroacetic acid  (TCA) combined with acetone (Semane et al., 2010). ‘Anji Baicha’ leaves were first  ground in liquid nitrogen into protein powder. The powder was washed by 10% TCA dissolved in acetone to remove the chlorophyll. After pre-cold acetone wash for 3  times, the sample was dissolved in lysis buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),  8 M urea, 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 2 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid  (EDTA). After a 3 min sonicating (about 23 bursts, 3s per burst) in ice-cold water at a  35% maximum power, the protein was then precipitated with 15% TCA for 2 h at  -20°C drop by drop, and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 g  for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, the precipitate was washed with cold acetone, and the  supernatant was redissolved in 100 mM tetraethyl-ammonium bromide with 8 M urea  (pH 8.0). Protein concentration was determined using the 2-D Quant kit according to  the manufacturer’s protocol.  Protein digestion was performed using a trypsin-based method. The protein  solution was reduced in 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 37°C and alkylated with 20 Mm  iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature in darkness. Then, trypsin was added  at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and 1:100  trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data was processed using MaxQuant with integrated Andromeda search engine (v.1.5.2.8). The tandem MS data were searched against the C. sinensis genome dataset (Xia et al., 2017) concatenated with a reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as the cleavage enzyme allowing up to 4 missing cleavages, 4 modifications per peptide and 5 charges. The mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation on  cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation on methionine, acetylation  on lysine and acetylation on the protein’s N-terminus were set as variable  modifications. False discovery rate (FDR) thresholds for peptide, protein and  modification site were specified at 1%. The minimum peptide length was set to 7. All  other parameters were set to the default values specified by MaxQuant, and > 0.75  was used for the site localization probability. Method for relative quantification was  shown in Supplementary Materials and methods.  LC-MS/MS measurement and data analysis for complete peptide mixture was  described in the Supplementary Materials and methods. Bioinformatics analyses, such as functional annotation, enrichment analysis, motif analysis and functional  interaction network analysis were performed as described previously (Xu et al., 2017).

### Publication Abstract
Tea leaf color is not only important from an aesthetics standpoint but is also related to tea quality. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that determine tea leaf color, we examined <i>Camellia sinensis</i> cv. 'Anjin Baicha' (an albino tea cultivar) by tandem mass tag isobaric labeling to generate a high-resolution proteome and acetyl-proteome atlas of three leaf developmental stages. We identified a total of 7,637 proteins and quantified 6,256; of these, 3,232 were classified as differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs). We also identified 3,161 lysine acetylation sites in 1,752 proteins and quantified 2,869 in 1,612 proteins. The acetylation levels at 468 sites were significantly altered across the three developmental stages during periodic albinism; the corresponding proteins were associated with a variety of biological processes. Interestingly, a large number of DAPs and acetylated proteins with increased/decreased acetylation were related to photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that the accumulation or acetylation level of these proteins regulates periodic albinism in 'Anjin Baicha.' Additionally, overlap between succinylome and acetylome among three 'Anjin Baicha' developmental stages were found. These data provide important insight into the mechanisms of leaf coloration in the tea plant. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to Proteome X change via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD008134.
