### Title
Narrow-window DIA: Ultra-fast quantitative analysis of comprehensive proteomes with high sequencing depth. Evaluation of window width and injection time.

### Description
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics aims to characterize comprehensive proteomes in a fast and reproducible manner. Here, we present an ultra-fast scanning data-independent acquisition (DIA) strategy consisting on 2-Th precursor isolation windows, dissolving the differences between data-dependent and independent methods. This is achieved by pairing a Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer with the asymmetric track lossless (Astral) analyzer that provides >200 Hz MS/MS scanning speed, high resolving power and sensitivity, as well as low ppm-mass accuracy. Narrow window DIA enables profiling of up to 100 full yeast proteomes per day, or ~10,000 human proteins in half-an-hour. Moreover, multi-shot acquisition of fractionated samples allows comprehensive coverage of human proteomes in ~3h, showing comparable depth to next-generation RNA sequencing and with 10x higher throughput compared to current state-of-the-art MS. High quantitative precision and accuracy is demonstrated with high peptide coverage in a 3-species proteome mixture, quantifying 14,000+ proteins in a single run in half-an-hour.

### Sample Protocol
Human cell lines were digested overnight using the protein aggregation capture *(PAC) protocol. The proteolytic digestion was performed by addition of LysC and trypsin enzymes 1:500 and 1:250 protein ratio respectively. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digestion was quenched by the addition of tri-fluoro acetic acid acid to final concentration of 1%. Peptide mixtures from human cell lines were further concentrated on SepPaks (C18 Vac C18 Cartridge, 1cc/50 mg 55–105 μm Waters, Milford, MA). Final peptide concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDrop 2000C spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were kept at -20 °C until further use. For the DIA experiments, 10, 25 and 100 ng of peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Astral MS coupled to a Thermo Scientific™ Vanquish™ Neo UHPLC system, and interfaced online using an EASY-Spray™ source, using an effecctive gradient of 60 minutes (total run time of 80 minutes), The Orbitrap Astral MS was operated at a full MS resolution of 240,000 with a full scan range of 380 − 980 m/z when stated. The full MS AGC was set to 500%. Fragment ion scans were recorded at a resolution of 80,000 with variable maxIT and window width (3.5 ms and 2 Th, 7 ms and 4 Th, 14 ms and 8Th and 28 ms and 16 Th)  scanning from 380-980 m/z. The isolated ions were fragmented using HCD with 25% NCE.

### Data Protocol
Raw files from window optimization samples were analyzed in Spectronaut v17 (Biognosys) with a library-free approach (directDIA+) using the human reference database (Uniprot 2022 release, 20,588 sequences) complemented with common contaminants (246 sequences). Cysteine carbamylation was set as a fixed modification, whereas methionine oxidation and protein N-termini acetylation were set as variable modifications. Precursor filtering was set as Q-value, cross run normalization was unchecked. Each experiment was analyzed separately, and those that contained different experimental conditions (different input amounts or acquisition methods) were search enabling method evaluation and indicating the different conditions (each one with n=3 experimental replicates) in the condition setup tab.
