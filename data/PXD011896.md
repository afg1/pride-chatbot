### Title
Small cell lung cancer cell line panel whole proteome analysis

### Description
We conducted a whole proteome analysis of a panel of human small cell lung cancer cell lines that were either sensitive, moderately sensitive, or insensitive to SQLE inhibition to try and identify proteome signatures of sensititivy

### Sample Protocol
8M urea lysis, Lys-C and Trypsin digestion, isobaric tag labelling (TMT), and LC-MSMS analysis on a Thermo Fusion Tribrid instrument

### Data Protocol
Analysis was conducted using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 using the Uniprot human reference proteome, SEQUEST, and Percolator algorithm for false discovery rate analysis.  All unique peptides were used for protein quantitation

### Publication Abstract
Aberrant metabolism of cancer cells is well appreciated, but the identification of cancer subsets with specific metabolic vulnerabilities remains challenging. We conducted a chemical biology screen and identified a subset of neuroendocrine tumors displaying a striking pattern of sensitivity to inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Using a variety of orthogonal approaches, we demonstrate that sensitivity to SQLE inhibition results not from cholesterol biosynthesis pathway inhibition, but rather surprisingly from the specific and toxic accumulation of the SQLE substrate, squalene. These findings highlight SQLE as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of neuroendocrine tumors, particularly small cell lung cancers.
