### Title
CTCF cooperates with CtIP to drive homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks

### Description
The pleiotropic CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) plays a role in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the precise mechanistic role of CTCF in HR remains largely unclear. Here, we show that CTCF engages in DNA end resection, which is the initial, crucial step in HR, through its interactions with MRE11 and CtIP. Depletion of CTCF profoundly impairs HR and attenuates CtIP recruitment at DSBs. CTCF physically interacts with MRE11 and CtIP and promotes CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Subsequently, CTCF facilitates DNA end resection to allow HR, in conjunction with MRE11-CtIP. Notably, the zinc finger domain of CTCF binds to both MRE11 and CtIP and enables proficient CtIP recruitment, DNA end resection, and HR. The N-terminus of CTCF is able to bind to only MRE11 and its C-terminus is incapable of binding to MRE11 and CtIP, thereby resulting in compromised CtIP recruitment, DSB resection, and HR. Overall, this suggests an important function of CTCF in DNA end resection through the recruitment of CtIP at DSBs. Collectively, our findings identify a critical role of CTCF at the first control point in selecting the HR repair pathway

### Sample Protocol
The 293T cells transiently expressing S protein-Flag-Streptavidin binding peptide (SFB)-tagged CTCF (SFB-CTCF) were treated with or without γ-irradiation. The cells were lysed with TAP-NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the crude lysates were incubated with Streptavidin-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The bead-bound proteins were washed and eluted with biotin (Sigma Aldrich) in TAP-NETN buffer. The eluates were then incubated with S-protein agarose beads (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The S-protein bead-bound proteins were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then visualized by staining with Instant Blue (Expedeon, Heidelberg, Germany). For LC-MS/MS analyses, the gel lanes were sliced into different bands and processed as follows. Briefly, the acetylated protein bands were divided into 10-mm sections and digested in the gel with trypsin. The tryptic digests were separated by online reversed-phase chromatography using a Thermo Scientific EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC equipped with an autosampler using a reversed-phase peptide trap Acclaim PepMapTM 100 (75-μm inner diameter, 2-cm length) and a reversed-phase analytical column PepMapTM RSLC C18 (75-μm inner diameter, 15-cm length, 3-μm particle size), both from Thermo Scientific. This was followed by electrospray ionization at a flow rate of 300 nL·min−1.

### Data Protocol
The chromatography system was coupled in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer. The obtained spectra were screened against the UniProt human database using Proteome Discoverer Sorcerer 2.1 software with a SEQUEST-based search algorithm. The comparative analysis of proteins identified in this study was performed using Scaffold 4 Q+S
