### Title
Neonatal Overfeeding and Transgenerational Inheritance of Obesity and alterations in Sperm Proteome

### Description
Identification of differentially proteins in the sperm proteome indifferent generations of mice subjected to Neonatal Overfeeding

### Sample Protocol
Epididymal tissue was filtered out and a percoll density gradient was used to isolate sperm cells and preserved in a cryoprotectantand . Cells were kept into liquid nitrogen until use. Proteins were solubilised, were digested and were labeled with TMT labeling. Peptides were cleaned and a 2DLC and MS/MS was performed.

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer software. Reporter ion quantification of HCDMS2 spectra was enabled, and TMT-10plex was set as quantification method.
