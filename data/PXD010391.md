### Title
proteome profilling of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas

### Description
LC-MS/MS based proteomics study of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas versus the adjacent healthy kidney tissues, ten patients included.

### Sample Protocol
Tissues were homogenized and the sample processing was done with the iST kit according to the instruction from PreOmics.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant software with the Andromeda search engine. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 for proteins, peptides and spectra was applied.
