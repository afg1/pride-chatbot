### Title
Axonal TDP-43 Drives NMJ Disruption through Inhibition of Local Protein Synthesis

### Description
Mislocalization of the predominantly nuclear RNA/DNA binding protein, TDP-43, occurs in motor neurons of ~95% of ALS patients, but the contribution of axonal TDP-43 to this fatal neurodegenerative disease is unclear. Here, we find TDP-43 accumulation in the axons of intra-muscular nerves from ALS patients, and in motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions(NMJs) of a mouse model with TDP-43 mislocalization. This leads to the formation of G3BP1- and TDP-43-positive RNA-granules in motor neuron axons, and to inhibition of local protein synthesis in axons and NMJs. Specifically, the axonal and synaptic levels of nuclear-encoded mitochondria proteins are reduced. Clearance of axonal TDP-43 restored local translation of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and rescued TDP-43-derived axonal and NMJ toxicity. These findings suggest that targeting TDP-43 axonal gain of function may mediata therapeutic effect in ALS.

### Sample Protocol
Axoplasm samples of LM or TDP43∆NLS mice (30 µg in 10% SDS) were acetone-precipitated and reconstituted in urea buffer (6M urea, 2M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES/KOH pH 8.0). Samples were reduced and alkylated with 5 mM TCEP and 20 mM CAA for 30 min at RT. Endoproteinase LysC (0.5 µg) was added, followed by incubation at RT for 3h. Samples were diluted fourfold with 50 mM ABC buffer and digested o/n with trypsin (0.5 µg). Formic acid was added to 1% and samples were desalted by Stop-and-Go extraction. Samples were eluted with 30 µL 1% NH4OH in 60% ACN for 15 min, dried in a Speedvac and reconstituted in 5% FA / 2% ACN. Data were acquired on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer operating in DDA mode.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed with MaxQuant (1.5.3.8). Spectra were correlated to the mouse Uniprot database (using the canonical FASTA file) including a list of common contaminants for filtering. Proteins were quantified using the implemented MaxLFQ algorithm. N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation was included as a fixed modification. Data were processed in Perseus (1.6.2.3): Data were filtered for contaminants and reverse peptides, followed by filtering for 2 valid values in at least one experiment group (LM or TDP43∆NLS). Missing values were imputed using the default settings. Student's t-test was performed as follows: S0=0.1, 500 randomizations, FDR 0.05. GO annotation enrichments were performed using the default settings.
