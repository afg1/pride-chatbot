### Title
76 human liver tissue proteomes by PCT-SWATH

### Description
Rapid proteotyping of 38 human liver tissues in duplicate using pressure-cycling technology (PCT) and SWATH mass spectrometry

### Sample Protocol
A total of 38 liver tissue samples from non-tumorous and tumorous regions in 19 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were prepared using presure cycling technology, and analysed using a TripleTOF 5600 using SWATH mode.

### Data Protocol
OpenSWATH and pan-human library was used to interpret the SWATH data in the iPortal platform.
