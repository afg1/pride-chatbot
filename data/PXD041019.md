### Title
Identification of the potential receptor of Musclin on C3H10T1/2 cell using BioID assay

### Description
To identify the potential receptor mediating the effect of Musclin on thermogenic adipocytes, we conducted a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) assay to obtain the interactome of Musclin on the plasma membrane of beige adipocytes.

### Sample Protocol
A proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) assay was used to identify the receptors for Musclin on the plasma membrane of adipocytes. In brief, the pCMV-BirA* or pCMV-Musclin-BirA* plasmids were transfected into the HEK293T cells. After transfection for 12 h, cells were switched to a serum-free medium for another 48 h, followed by the collection of condition medium (CM) enriched in BirA* or Musclin-BirA* fusion protein. Then, the fully differentiated C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated with the CM supplemented with 80 μM biotin for 24 h. Cell membrane-associated proteins were separated through differential centrifugation and then pulled down using streptavidin agarose at 4°C with an overnight end-over-end rotation. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and then subjected to five times washing with washing buffer, followed by protein denaturation, SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and silver staining . The gel fragments in pulldown samples containing differential protein bands as compared to control were collected for electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS spectra were searched against the selected database using Proteome Discovery searching algorithm (version 1.4).The search criteria were as follows: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavage was allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) were set as the fixed modifications; the oxidation (M) and Phospho(S,T,Y) was set as the variable modification; precursor ion mass tolerances were set at 20 ppm; and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 20 mmu.
