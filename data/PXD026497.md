### Title
M1BP cooperates with CP190 to activate transcription at TAD borders and promote chromatin insulator activity

### Description
Genome organization is driven by forces affecting transcriptional state, but the relationship between transcription and genome architecture remains unclear. Here, we identified the Drosophila transcription factor Motif 1 Binding Protein (M1BP) in physical association with the gypsy chromatin insulator core complex, including the universal insulator protein CP190. M1BP is required for enhancer-blocking and barrier activities of the gypsy insulator as well as its proper nuclear localization. Genome-wide, M1BP specifically colocalizes with CP190 at Motif 1-containing promoters, which are enriched at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders. M1BP facilitates CP190 chromatin binding at many shared sites and vice versa. Both factors promote Motif 1-dependent gene expression and transcription near TAD borders genome-wide. Finally, loss of M1BP reduces chromatin accessibility and increases both inter- and intra-TAD local genome compaction. Our results reveal physical and functional interaction between CP190 and M1BP to activate transcription at TAD borders and mediate chromatin insulator-dependent genome organization.

### Sample Protocol
Nuclear extracts from 18 g of mixed stage (0â€“24 h) Drosophila embryos27 were lysed in 5 mL HBSMT-0.3% + 1 M KCl (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 M KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100 [v/v] at pH 7) including 1 mM PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Immunoprecipitation was performed using methods described above, and beads were washed twice with HBSMT-0.3% + 1 M KCl, once with HBSM (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2), and eluted with 1% Sodium Dodecanoate. Six replicates for each IP were pooled together for mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were analyzed using tandem HPLC-mass spectrometry at the NIDDK Mass Spectrometry Facility. Mass from eluted peptides was queried in the UniProt database, and results were analyzed by MaxQuant.
