### Title
Listeria monocytogenes phosphoproteomics

### Description
Phosphopeptides were identified in Listeria monocytogesn strain constitutivally expressing PrfA. Also, the phosphoproteins and proteins were identified that are overexpressed/underextressed in response to PrfA.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were digested, phosphopeptides enriched and submitted to Orbitrap for mass spectrometry identification.

### Data Protocol
In-solution digestion was used fro the proteins then phosphopeptides were fractionated by SCX chromatography, enriched by TiO2 beads and mass spectrometry was performed to identify the proteins and phosphoproteins.
