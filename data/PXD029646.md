### Title
MCU interactome from mitochondria proteome

### Description
The interactome of MCU was determined by AP-MS in a minaturised approach. This dataset was the test dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the method.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes extracted from whole cells were reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin as described in the methods. The peptides were desalted and concentrated by reverse-phase tips and prepared for LC-MS. All LC-MS experiments were performed on an Agilent 1200 HPLC nanoflow system coupled to a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were matched to peptides and proteins using Mascot and Phenyx, with a false discovery rate of 1% at the protein level.
