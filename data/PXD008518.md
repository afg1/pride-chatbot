### Title
Analysis of RIPK1 phosphorylation in vitro

### Description
This study aims at determining which RIPK1 residues are phosphorylated.

### Sample Protocol
In vitro kinase assay was performed to identify novel RIPK1 phosphorylation site.

### Data Protocol
Protein digests were analysed by data dependent acquisition on the Q-Exactive Plus coupled to nLC 1000. Data was searched by MaxQuant against the human UniProt database. PSMs, peptidesand proteins were filtered at a 1% false discovery rate.
