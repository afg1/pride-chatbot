### Title
MTD  project_title  A Calcium-Permeable Transporter AtANN1 Mediates Cold-Induced Calcium Signaling and Freezing Tolerance.

### Description
MTD  project_description  Here we present a LC-MS analysis to detected the phosphorylation of AtANN1 at Ser289.

### Sample Protocol
MTD  sample_processing_protocal   Total proteins were extracted from 12-d-old AtANN1-Myc overexpressing plants treated at 4Â°C for 0, 10, 30 and 120 min, followed by trypsin digestion. Phosphopeptides were enriched for mass spectrometry analysis.

### Data Protocol
MTD  data_processing_protocal  Raw data from the mass spectrometer were preprocessed with Mascot Distiller 2.4 for peak picking. The resulted peak lists were searched against XXX database using Mascot 2.5 search engine. The search parameters are: Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C), Variable modifications: Oxidation (M) and Phosphorylation (S, T, Y). Enzyme: Trypsin, Maximum missed cleavages: 2, MS mass tolerance: 10 ppm, MSMS mass tolerance: 0.02 Da. Scaffold PTM was used to evaluated phosphorylation sites of the Mascot search results using Ascore algorithm.
