### Title
Proteomic  analysis of dog plateletes and LFQ quantitation

### Description
Dog platelets were isolated and stimulated from 10 different dogs and protein quantiattaion was done based on LFQ.

### Sample Protocol
2 samples from each of the 10 dogs were in gel digested and the samples were analysis by nano LC-MS/MS in fusion

### Data Protocol
The raw data collected for each sample were analyzed by proteome discoverer 2.3 by LFQ processing workflow

### Publication Abstract
None
