### Title
Proteomic analysis of integrin adhesion complex disassembly induced by nocodazole

### Description
To explore the dynamics of integrin adhesion complex disassembly, isolated adhesion complexes from U2OS cells were subjected to mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis. U2OS cells were allowed to spread on FN, treated with nocodazole for 4 hours to disrupt microtubules. To coordinate microtubule-induced integrin adhesion complex disassembly nocodazole was subsequently washed out and adhesion complexes isolated at 5, 10 and 15 minutes during this process.

### Sample Protocol
Integrin adhesion complexes were isolated accordingly to published protocols (Jones et al 2015: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727331). Complexes were analysed by mass spectrometry using in-gel trypsin digestion. Each sample was separated into 10 gel slices for LC-MS/MS and recombined during subsequent data processing.

### Data Protocol
RAW files were processed to peak list files (.mgf) and combined for a single database search using Mascot Daemon. Mascot output files (.dat) were imported to Scaffold and filtered using 90% peptide, 99% protein with at least 2 unique peptides per protein to generate lists of identified proteins.
