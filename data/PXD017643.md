### Publication Abstract
To identify markers in the CSF of multiple sclerosis (MS) subtypes, we used a two-step proteomic approach: (i) Discovery proteomics compared 169 pooled CSF from MS subtypes and inflammatory/degenerative CNS diseases (NMO spectrum and Alzheimer disease) and healthy controls. (ii) Next, 299 proteins selected by comprehensive statistics were quantified in 170 individual CSF samples. (iii) Genes of the identified proteins were also screened among transcripts in 73 MS brain lesions compared to 25 control brains. F-test based feature selection resulted in 8 proteins differentiating the MS subtypes, and secondary progressive (SP)MS was the most different also from controls. Genes of 7 out these 8 proteins were present in MS brain lesions: GOLM was significantly differentially expressed in active, chronic active, inactive and remyelinating lesions, FRZB in active and chronic active lesions, and SELENBP1 in inactive lesions. Volcano maps of normalized proteins in the different disease groups also indicated the highest amount of altered proteins in SPMS. Apolipoprotein C-I, apolipoprotein A-II, augurin, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase gamma, and trypsin-1 were upregulated in the CSF of MS subtypes compared to controls. This CSF profile and associated brain lesion spectrum highlight non-inflammatory mechanisms in differentiating CNS diseases and MS subtypes and the uniqueness of SPMS.
