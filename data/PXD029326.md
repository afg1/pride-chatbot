### Title
The E3 Ligase CUL3 physically interacts with TANGO10 protein in vivo

### Description
List of protein scores for putative TANGO10 interactors from mass spectrometry analysis of FLAG-tagged TANGO10 using either elav-GAL4 or tim-GAL4 at both ZT10 and ZT 22, as determined using Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher). Fly heads from GAL4 heterozygotes were used as controls. The hits from FLAG-tagged twenty-four (TYF) proteomics were also excluded from the list to increase TANGO10-specificity. Proteins listed are those present in at least one elav-GAL4 sample and at least one tim-GAL4 sample but no negative controls.

### Sample Protocol
Transfected S2 cells and transgenic fly heads (tim-GAL4/UAS-Tango10-3xFLAG, elav-GAL4/Y; UAS-Tango10-3xFLAG/+) expressing triple FLAG-tagged TANGO10 were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads at ZT10 or ZT22, as in (6), with n=1 experiment per timepoint for each GAL4. Bound proteins were eluted using 3xFLAG peptides (Sigma).

### Data Protocol
The eluted samples were subject to LC-MS/MS analysis by the Northwestern Proteomics Core Facility. The proteomics hits were identified from analysis using Proteome Discoverer software ver 1.3 (Thermo Scientific), with hits for each GAL4 defined as proteins identified from either or both timepoints. Proteins identified in any GAL4-only controls were excluded. Proteins identified in proteomic analysis of FLAG-tagged TWENTY-FOUR (TYF) in fly heads (6) were also removed from the hit list to improve specificity.
