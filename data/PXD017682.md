### Title
HLA-DR ligands from BLCLs 9022 and 9087

### Description
HLA-DR-bound peptides eluted from B-lymphoblastoid cell lines 9022 and 9087.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets from BLCLs 9022 and 9087 were lysed in a mild detergent. Following lysis, peptide-HLA complexes were affinity purified by anti-HLA-DR antibody (LB3.1). Affinity purified HLA molecules and their peptide cargo were separated using reversed-phase chromatography and peptides were subsequently analysed using mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw data (.wiff from Sciex TripleTof 5600) was searched using ProteinPilot (v5; SCIEX) using following parameters: database: Human proteins from UniProt/SwissProt v2016_12, no cysteine alkylation, no enzyme digestion (considers all peptide bond cleavages), instrument-specific settings for TripleTOF 5600+ (MS tolerance 0.05 Da, MS/MS tolerance 0.1 Da, charge state +2 to +5), biological modification probabilistic features on, thorough ID algorithm, detected protein threshold 0.05.
