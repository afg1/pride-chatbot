### Title
A single immunization with CAF08 provides newborns with Th1-mediated protection against Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection

### Description
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children, due in part to their distinct immune system, characterized by impaired induction of T-helper 1 (Th1)‐immunity. Here we describe cationic adjuvant formulation (CAF)-08, a liposomal vaccine formulation tailored to induce Th1 immunity in early life via synergistic engagement of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 and the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. Quantitative phosphoproteomics applied to human dendritic cells revealed a key role for Protein Kinase C- for enhanced Th1 cytokine production in neonatal dendritic cells and identified signaling events resulting in antigen cross-presentation. In vivo, a single immunization at birth with CAF08-adjuvanted RSV pre-fusion antigen protected newborn mice from RSV infection through induction of antigen-specific CD8+ and Th1 cells.  Overall, we describe a novel pediatric adjuvant formulation and characterize its mechanism of action providing a promising avenue for development of early life vaccines against RSV and other intracellular pathogens.

### Sample Protocol
MoDCs were seeded in 6-well plates at 3-5 x 106 cells per condition and rested for 30 min before stimulation with agonists as indicated for another 30 min. After stimulation, cells were harvested on ice and lysed in 50mM Tris; 150mM NaCl pH 7.7; 0.5% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich); 1 M DTT; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 1% (v/v) HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich); 1% (v/v) Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma-Aldrich); 1% (v/v) phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples were frozen at -80°C and further processed batch-wise to reduce batch-effects. Equal protein amounts of all samples were denatured and digested with trypsin (Thermo Scientific) on Microcon-10 Centrifugal Filters (Millipore). Phosphorylated peptides were enriched by HPLC using a FeCl3-charged ProPAC IMAC-10 column (Thermo Scientific) as described previously. Phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were desalted using a 1 cc Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters Corp.). Samples were analyzed on a nanoflow ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (400 Series, Eksigent/Sciex) hyphenated with a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive; Thermo Scientific). The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was run in positive-ion mode. Full scans were carried out at a resolution of 70 K with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 x 106 ions and a maximum injection time of 120 ms, using a scan range of 350 to 2,000 m/z. For tandem MS (MS/MS) data acquisition, a normalized collision energy value of 27 was used. Scans were carried out at a resolution of 35 K with an AGC target of 3 x 106 ions and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. The isolation window was set to2 m/z. An underfill ratio of 0.5% was set and a dynamic exclusion value of 20 s applied.

### Data Protocol
RAW files generated using XCalibur software (version 2.2; Thermo Scientific), were analyzed using Maxquant (version 1.5.6.5) for identification and quantification of phosphopeptides. Phosphorylation (STY) and oxidation (M) were used as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. Match between run and label-free quantification (LFQ) were enabled. iBAQ was calculated for all samples. Log2-normalized fold changes over vehicle-treated condition and corresponding p-value (Paired Student’s t-test) for each phosphopeptide were derived using Perseus (version 1.5.6.0) 81. A weighted p-value cutoff was applied (s0=2, FDR=0.05) to determine statistically significant changes in phosphorylation over vehicle-treated conditions. Pathway overrepresentation analysis (ORA) was assessed for proteins with significant change in phosphorylation status over vehicle-treated conditions using InnateDB For ORA, multiple protein function databases were mined; KEGG, REACTOME, PID NCI, BioCarta, NetPath 50and INOH.
