### Title
Directed natural evolution generates a next-generation oncolytic virus with a high potency and safety profile for multiple solid tumors

### Description
Mass spectrometry raw data for submitting manuscript entitled "Directed natural evolution generates a next-generation oncolytic virus with a high potency and safety profile for multiple solid tumors" to Nature Communications.

### Sample Protocol
After reduction and alkylation, Trypsin(mass ratio 1:50) was added and enzymolized at 37 ° C for 20 hours. The enzymolysis products were desalted, lyophilized, redissolved in 0.1%FA solution, and stored at -20℃ until use.

### Data Protocol
Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher); Easy-nLC 1000(Thermo Fisher)

### Publication Abstract
None
