### Title
An in vitro model maintaining taxon-specific functional activities of the gut microbiome

### Description
We developed and validated a 96-deep well plate-based culturing model named Mipro to maintain individuals’ microbiomes. The Mipro model quintupled viable bacteria count while maintained the functional and compositional profiles of individuals’ gut microbiomes.

### Sample Protocol
The microbial cell pellets were lysed by ultrasonication in 200 µL lysis buffer (4 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0; plus Roche PhosSTOP™ and Roche cOmplete™ Mini tablets), and proteins precipitated overnight in acidified acetone/ethanol at -20°C. Proteins were washed three times with ice-cold acetone, then dissolved in 6 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8). Protein concentrations were determined by DC (detergent compatible) protein assay before an overnight trypsin digestion at 37oC following protein reduction and alkylation. Desalted tryptic peptides corresponding to 1 μg of protein were loaded for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Protein/peptide identification and quantification were carried out using the MetaLab software (version 1.0), which automates the MetaPro-IQ approach.
