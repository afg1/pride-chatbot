### Title
Quantitative proteomics  of  TGFβ1-stimulated endothelial cells using iTRAQ, LC-MSMS

### Description
Endothelial to mesenchymal transition is a possible source of myofibroblasts, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. EndMT participate in tissue fibrotic processes in various organs. TGF-β family growth factors are involved in the initiation of EndMT. This process plays a crucial role  n the pathogenesis of various fibrotic diseases.

### Sample Protocol
HMEC-1 cells were treated with 5ng/ml TGF-β1 for 30 hours. The proteins were precipitated with acetone. Eight 100µg samples (four controls and four samples after TGF-β1 treatment) were prepared for quantitative analysis. iTRAQ-labeled samples were detected by LC-MS/MS on Orbitrap Velos type mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The acquired MS/MS data were pre-processed with Mascot Distiller v.2.3, and a search was performed with the Mascot Search Engine (Mascot Server 2.4) against the set of Human protein sequences derived from SwissProt database.
