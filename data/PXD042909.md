### Title
The Golgi stacking protein GRASP55 represents an effector protein of the natural compound Prodigiosin

### Description
The bacterial secondary metabolite prodigiosin has been shown to exert anticancer, antimalarial, antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. With regard to cancer, it has been reported that it affects tumor cells but not non-malignant cells, making it a promising lead compound for anticancer drug discovery. However, a direct protein target has not yet been experimentally identified. Here, we identify the Golgi stacking protein GRASP55 as effector target protein of prodigiosin and found evidence that GRASP55 knockout cells show an altered pattern on secreted proteins upon prodigionsin treatment.

### Sample Protocol
HeLa wt or HeLa GRASP55 KO cells were cultured under serum-free conditions and treated with 100 nM prodigiosin or 0.1% DMSO for 24 h. The conditoned medium was collected and proteins prepared for mass spectrometric analysis by a modification of the SP3 protocol (PMID: 30464214). Briefly, proteins were on-bead reduced and alkylated, digested with trypsin and resulting peptides desalted by solid phase extraction (HLB-µElution plate, Waters).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometric data was analysed with DIA-NN 1.8.1 on the basis of a predicted spectral library based on 81837 homo sapiens sequences (UP000005640, downloaded on 12th January 2023 from UniProt KB) and potential contaminants based on the the MaxQuant 2.1.0.0 contamination list.
