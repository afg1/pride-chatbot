### Title
Influence of spermidine on the mouse brain proteome

### Description
Label-free expression proteomics of mouse brain. Three individuals per group, young mice, aged mice, and aged mice treated with spermidine were compared by bottom-up proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
Whole tissue lysates were separated by SDS PAGE and proteins in-gel digested using trypsin, ten slices per sample, prior LC-MSMS analyses. Two technical replicates per sample were analyzed on (a) a LTQ Orbitrap XL, and (b) a Q Exactive Plus.

### Data Protocol
Data was analysed by MaxQuant Version 1.4.1.2 using the LFQ algorithm.
