### Title
Middle Pleistocene protein sequences from the rhinoceros genus Stephanorhinus and the phylogeny of extant and extinct Middle/Late Pleistocene Rhinocerotidae.

### Description
Characterization of Middle Pleistocene rhinoceros proteins and the phylogenetic relationships between extinct and extanct rhinoceros was investigated by obtaining ancient protein data for two extinct rhinoceros genera (Coelodonta antiquitatis and Stephanorhinus sp.).

### Sample Protocol
Bone proteins were consecutively extracted by ammonium-bicarbonate buffer extraction and HCL acid demineralization (0.5 M). Protein fractions were digest at 37 degrees by trypsin overnight. The enzymatic digestion was quenched by the addition of TFA, and peptide purification/desalting was subsequently performed on C18 ZipTips. Peptide extracts where lyophilized and analyzed on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were converted to .mgf files and searched in PEAKS v. 7. Searches were conducted against the white rhinoceros reference proteome, with the addition of over 100 commonly or suspected protein contaminants from non-rhinoceros species. Protein matches were accepted with a protein score of over 20, with a minimum of 2 unique peptides per protein and a peptide FDR of 1.0%.
