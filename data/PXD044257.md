### Title
A simple method for developing lysine targeted covalent protein reagents

### Description
In this project we developed phosphopeptides functionalized with methacrylate ester warheads installed on a cysteine residue, which bind covalently to the protein 14-3-3 sigma. We prepared complexes of the purified protein with the peptides and used trypsin digestion and LC-MSMS to elucidate the binding site of the peptides, by comparison of compound-treated complexes to DMSO-treated protein and observing the disappearance on non-modified peptides.   The file names are based on internal names used for the project and are distinct from the names given to the peptides in the final publication. Names are as follows: 4IEA - peptide 3 in the final publication 128C - peptide 8 in the final publication 132C - peptide 11 in the final publication

### Sample Protocol
14-3-3Ã�Æ’ was diluted to 2 Ã‚ÂµM in HEPES 25 mM pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and incubated with 5 Ã‚ÂµM peptide in samples of 50 Ã‚Âµl. The samples were incubated for 48 hours at room temperature, resulting in ~75% labeling by peptide 3, 90% labeling by peptide 8 and 100% labeling by peptide 11. At this point 50 Ã‚Âµl of 10% SDS in HEPES 25 mM pH =7.5 was added and DTT was added to 5 mM, followed by incubation at 65Ã‚Â°C for 45 minutes. This was followed by addition of iodoacetamide to 10 mM and incubation of 40 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The samples were then processed using S-trap (Protify) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by desalting using Oasis plate (Waters).  Each sample was dissolved in 50 Ã‚Âµl of 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid, and 0.5 Ã‚Âµl was injected to the column. Samples were analyzed using EASY-nLC 1200 nano-flow UPLC system, using PepMap RSLC C18 column (2 ÃŽÂ¼m particle size, 100 Ãƒâ€¦ pore size, 75 ÃŽÂ¼m diameter Ãƒâ€” 50 cm length), mounted using an EASY-Spray source onto an Exploris 240 mass spectrometer. uLC/MS-grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps at 300 nL/min. The mobile phase was: (A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and (B) 80% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40% B in 60 min, 40Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100% B in 5 min, maintained at 100% for 20 min, 100 to 1% in 10 min, and finally 1% for 5 min. Ionization was achieved using a 1900 V spray voltage with an ion transfer tube temperature of 275 Ã‚Â°C. Initially, data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. MS1 resolution was set to 120,000 (at 200 m/z), a mass range of 375Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1650 m/z, normalized AGC of 300%, and the maximum injection time was set to 20 ms. MS2 resolution was set to 15,000, quadrupole isolation 1.4 m/z, normalized AGC of 100%, and maximum injection time of 22 ms, and HCD collision energy at 30%. 3 injections of 0.5 Ã‚Âµl were performed for each sample.

### Data Protocol
The DDA data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.6.3.4. The database contained the sequence of the 14-3-3Ã�Æ’ construct used in the study, and contaminants were included. Methionine oxidation and N terminal acetylation were variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl was a fixed modification in the analysis, with up to 4 modifications per peptide. Digestion was defined as trypsin/P with up to 2 missed cleavages. PSM FDR was defined as 1 and Protein FDR/Site Decoy fraction were defined as 0.01. Second Peptides were enabled and Match between runs was enabled with a Match time window of 0.7 minutes. The data was imported into skyline and precursors from 9 peptides containing or following the residues Cys38, Lys49 and Lys122 were selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). In every acquisition cycle, one full MS spectrum was taken at a range of 350-1000 Da, 300% AGC target, maximum injection time 20 ms at a resolution of 120,000. Data for each precursor was measured during a 4-5 minute window around the retention time measured in the DDA run, with Q1 resolution of 2 Da, orbitrap resolution of 15,000, 300% AGC target and maximum injection time of 160 ms. The acquired data was then analyzed in skyline using a spectral library generated from the DDA runs. The 3 most intense product ions were used for quantitation relative to the DMSO control.

### Publication Abstract
Peptide-based covalent probes can target shallow protein surfaces not typically addressable using small molecules, yet there is a need for versatile approaches to convert native peptide sequences into covalent binders that can target a broad range of residues. Here we report protein-based thio-methacrylate esters-electrophiles that can be installed easily on unprotected peptides and proteins via cysteine side chains, and react efficiently and selectively with cysteine and lysine side chains on the target. Methacrylate phosphopeptides derived from 14-3-3-binding proteins irreversibly label 14-3-3&#x3c3; via either lysine or cysteine residues, depending on the position of the electrophile. Methacrylate peptides targeting a conserved lysine residue exhibit pan-isoform binding of 14-3-3 proteins both in lysates and in extracellular media. Finally, we apply this approach to develop protein-based covalent binders. A methacrylate-modified variant of the colicin E9 immunity protein irreversibly binds to the E9 DNAse, resulting in significantly higher thermal stability relative to the non-covalent complex. Our approach offers a simple and versatile route to convert peptides and proteins into potent covalent binders.
