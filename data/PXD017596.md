### Title
Cranial Irradiation Impairs Juvenile Social Behavior and Modulates Hippocampal Physiology

### Description
Cranial and craniospinal irradiation are the oldest central nervous system prophylaxis treatments considered for pediatric patients with lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  However, survivors of childhood ALL that received cranial radiotherapy are at increased risk for deficits in neurocognitive skills. The continuous and dynamic response of normal tissue after irradiation has been identified as one of the causative factors for cognitive changes after cranial radiation therapy.  The aim of our study was to investigate the radiation effects on social behavior and neuronal morphology in the hippocampus of adult mice.  Twenty-one-day-old male C57BL/6 mice were irradiated with the small-animal radiation research platform (SARRP). Animals were given a single 10-Gy dose of radiation of X-ray cranial radiation. One month following irradiation, animals underwent behavioral testing in the Three-Chamber Sociability paradigm.  Radiation affected social discrimination during the third stage eliciting an inability to discriminate between the familiar and stranger mouse, while sham successfully spent more time exploring the novel stranger.  Proteomic analysis revealed dysregulation of metabolic and signaling pathways associated with neurocognitive dysfunction such as mitochondrial dysfunction, Rac 1 signaling, and synaptogenesis signaling. We observed significant decreases in mushroom spine density in the Cornu Ammonis 2 of the hippocampus, which is associated sociability processing.

### Sample Protocol
The male mice were irradiated with the use of the SARRP. They were anaesthetized with 1% isoflurane inhalation for the duration of the radiation exposure at 0 Gy (n = 10) 10 Gy (n = 10). Each mouse was placed prone on the horizontal bed in the SARRP. A cone beam computed tomographic image of each mouse was obtained to deliver image-guided radiation targeted to the brain at 60 kVp and 0.8 mA; reconstruction was accomplished with the use of 720 projections. From Merislice, image precision targeting of the brain was determined to avoid the eyes and frontal lobe. One cohort received 1 round of 2 × 5-Gy x-ray irradiation from 90° and –90° gantry angles with an isocenter tissue depth of 5 mm. The brain-targeted radiation doses were delivered with a 0.5-mm copper filter with a 5 × 5 mm collimator using 220 kVp and 13 mA. All sham-irradiated mice were anaesthetized and placed in the SARRP for an equivalent amount time as the irradiated mice.  The hippocampus was removed and placed in 400 µl of RIPA lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl). The tissue was homogenized on ice, incubated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and stored at -80 °C until processing. The Compat-AbleTM Protein Assay Preparation Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific ™) was used to eliminate EGTA as an interfering substance for the BCA Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific ™). Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using the 4-15% Criterion™ TGX™ Precast Midi Protein Gel, 18-well, 30 uL (Bio-Rad) ran at 120V for 75 min. The gel was stained using Coomassie Blue staining (Bio-Rad). The samples were then sent to the UAMS Proteomics Core for further processing for mass spectrometry. GeLC-MS/MS Analysis Each SDS-PAGE gel lane was sectioned into 12 segments of equal volume. Each segment was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as follows. Gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Fisher), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by reduction in 10 mM Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (Pierce) and alkylation in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were then dehydrated in acetonitrile (Fisher), followed by addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37oC for 12-16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase XSelect CSH C18 2.5 um resin (Waters) on an in-line 150 x 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 97:3 to 67:33 buffer A: B ratio.  [Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV) followed by MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. Following HCD activation, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified and quantified by searching the UniprotKB database restricted to Mus musculus using MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0, Max Planck Institute). The database search parameters included selecting the MS1 reporter type, trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages, fixed modifications for carbamidomethyl of cysteine, variable modifications for oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus, the precursor ion tolerance of 5 ppm for the first search and 3 ppm for the main search, and label-free quantitation with iBAQ normalized intensities. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm 20.  MaxQuant iBAQ intensities for each sample were median-normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median. Median-normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute) to perform log2 transformation and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. The Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) Bioconductor package was used to calculate differential expression among the experimental conditions using the lmFit and eBayes functions 20,21. Proteins were considered to be significantly different with a fold change > 2 and an FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05. Differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) to identify pathways and networks.  Data were expressed as means +/– the standard error of the mean (SEM). We conducted all statistical analyses with Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad), and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Visible- and hidden-platform water-maze learning curves were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. We used Holm’s correction to control for multiple comparisons, and separate analyses were conducted for the visible- and hidden-platform learning curves. For analysis of performance in the MWM probe trials, we used one-way ANOVAs with Holm’s post-hoc test, when appropriate.
