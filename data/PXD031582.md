### Title
LOSS OF THE BATTEN DISEASE PROTEIN CLN3 LEADS TO MIS-TRAFFICKING OF M6PR AND DEFECTIVE AUTOPHAGIC-LYSOSOMAL REFORMATION

### Description
Batten disease, one of the most devastating types of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by mutations in CLN3. Here, we show that CLN3 is a vesicular trafficking hub connecting the Golgi and lysosome compartments. Proteomic analysis reveals that CLN3 interacts with several endo-lysosomal trafficking proteins, including the cation-independent mannose 6 phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), which coordinates the targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. CLN3 depletion results in mis-trafficking of CI-M6PR, mis-sorting of lysosomal enzymes, and defective autophagic lysosomal reformation. Conversely, CLN3 overexpression promotes the formation of multiple lysosomal tubules, which are autophagy and CI-M6PR-dependent, generating newly formed proto-lysosomes. Together, our findings reveal that CLN3 functions as a link between the M6P-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal reformation pathway, explaining the global impairment of lysosomal function in Batten disease.
 


### Sample Protocol
All the experiments were performed in a labeling free setting and samples prepared using the in StageTip (iST) method. Instruments for LC MS/MS analysis consisted of a NanoLC 1200 coupled via a nano-electrospray ionization source to the quadrupole-based Q Exactive HF benchtop mass spectrometer. Peptide separation was carried out according to their hydrophobicity on a home-made chromatographic column, 75m ID, 8Um tip, 250mm bed packed with Reprosil-PUR, C18-AQ, 1.9m particle size, 120 Angstrom pore size (New Objective, Inc., cat. PF7508-250H363), using a binary buffer system consisting of solution A: 0.1% formic acid and B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Runs of 240 min after loading were used for proteome, while runs of 75 min were used for Interactome and Lyso-IP. In both cases, a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min was used.  MS data were acquired using a data‐dependent top‐20, for the proteome, or top-15, for interactome, method with maximum injection time of 20 ms, a scan range of 300–1650Th, an AGC target of 3e6 and a resolution of 120000. Resolution, for MS/MS spectra, was set to 15,000 at 200m/z, for the proteome, and 45000 at 200m/z, for interactome. AGC target was set 1E5, max injection time to 20ms and the isolation window to 1.4Th. The intensity threshold was set at 2.0 E4 and Dynamic exclusion at 30 seconds.

### Data Protocol
Raw mass spectrometry data were processed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.10) using default settings (FDR = 0.01, oxidized methionine (M) and acetylation (protein N‐term) as variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification). For protein assignment, spectra were correlated with the Uniprot Homo Sapiens (v.2019), including list of common contaminants. Label‐free quantitation (LFQ) and “Match between runs” were enabled. Bioinformatics analysis was performed with Perseus 1.6.2.360. The LFQ intensities were logarithmized, grouped and filtered for min.valid number( min.3 in at least one group). Missing values have been replaced by random numbers that are drawn from a normal distribution. Proteins with Log2 ratios ≥1 and a p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. To identify significant enriched GO terms in Lyso-IP, we utilized the 1D enrichment tool in Perseus61. The protein-protein interaction network was built in the Cytoscape environment. Proteins belonging to the selected cluster were loaded into the STRING plugin and the network was subsequently generated
