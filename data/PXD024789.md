### Title
Wells Lab Primary T Cell Surfaceomics

### Description
Glycoprotein cell surface capture proteomics of effector T cells following activation as well as co-culture with Tregs and hypoxic culture.

### Sample Protocol
T cells were expanded in SILAC media before hydrazide-based cell surface enrichment protocol using established methods (see Leung et al. 2020, PNAS). Data were collected on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were converted to .mgf peaklists and searched using ProteinProspector (v5.13.2) against the human proteome (Swissprot release August 3, 2017). Prospector data were exported as Bibliospec files and subsequently quantified using Skyline software against a curated list of membrane-annotated proteins. Quantified SILAC data was then statistically analyzed using an in-house R script.
