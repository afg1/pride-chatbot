### Title
Proteinases in psoriatic arthritis

### Description
Characterize active synovial fluid (SF) serine proteinases in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in comparison to osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

### Sample Protocol
SF samples from PsA, RA and OA patients (n=2 in each group) were run on precast PAGEr Tris-Glycine Gold 4-20% gels under reducing conditions to identify potential serine proteinases based on size. Excised gel bands were destained with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile followed by reduction and alkylation using DTT and iodoacetamide. The gel fragments were treated with trypsin for digestion overnight

### Data Protocol
Peptides were analyzed on the Q Exactive Plus Mass Spectrometer. Proteins were identified using MaxQuant, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 as the filtering criteria for identification. Differences or trends between groups were determined using the Perseus software
