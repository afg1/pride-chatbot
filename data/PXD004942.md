### Title
Proteomic profiling of Biomphalaria glabrata plasma proteins

### Description
Proteomic profiling of Biomphalaria glabrata plasma proteins with binding affinity to those expressed by early developing larval Schistosoma mansoni

### Sample Protocol
Biotinylated sporocyst tegumental proteins and larval transformation proteins (LTP) were affixed to avidin-agarose beads and used as affinity matrices to enrich for larval-reactive plasma proteins from susceptible (NMRI) and resistant (BS-90) strains of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata. Enriched proteins were trypsynized and identified via nano-LC/MS-MS on the Orbitrap-Elite platform proteomic analyses

### Data Protocol
The original raw MS/MS peptide datasets were initially searched against the six-frame translation of the Biomphalaria glabrata genome super-contig sequence database (899,428 sequences) and subsequently against the corresponding scaffold translations found in the B. glabrata genome assembly in VectorBase. All queries incorporated an in-house Mascot search engine, with Met oxidation and Asp/Glu deamidation as variable modifications. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 15 ppm and fragment mass was set at 0.6 Da. Putative ORFs containing exact peptide matches were subjected to pBLAST searches against the non-redundant NCBI protein database to obtain initial protein identifications.
