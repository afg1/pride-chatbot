### Title
Proteomic analysis data of sugar beet plants

### Description
TMT protein analysis was performed by collecting the leaves and roots of sugar beet seedling stage. The experiment uses the principle of TMT quantification, and the total protein content is determined by BCA quantification and SDS-PAGE.

### Sample Protocol
Sample collection, protein extraction and quality inspection, reductive alkylation and enzymatic hydrolysis, TMT labeling and mixing, C18 reversed phase column separation, LC-MS/MS computer analysis, database search software output data.

### Data Protocol
NCBInr full library; NCBInr classification library, including animal library, plant library, microorganism library, bacteria library, etc.; SwissProt/UniProt classification library, including animal library, plant library, microorganism library, bacteria library, etc.; NCBInr corresponds to the species library, including human, wheat, yeast, E. coli, etc.; Other species libraries, such as self-test genomes, transcriptome databases. The software version used for database search is ProteomeDiscoverer TM Software 2.2. Submit the raw file to ProteomeDiscoverer when checking the database Server
