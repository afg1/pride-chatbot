### Description
Comprehensive study of the human brain-insoluble proteome in AD by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis of detergent insoluble fractions was processed based on our optimized LC-MS/MS protocol. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) using bovine serum albumin as standard, and further verified by Coomassie staining on a short SDS gel. Approximately 50 ug of protein per sample were resolved on a 9% SDS gel and stained with Coomassie blue. Each gel lane was excised into 20 bands followed by in-gel trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (2 h) on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). MS/MS spectra were searched against a human reference database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the SEQUEST algorithm (version 28). Identifications in Sequest .out files were converted into pepXML format using out2xml program of the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (Institute of Systems Biology,Seattle, WA). Searching parameters included mass tolerance of precursor ions (+- 20 ppm) and product ion (+- 0.5 Da), partial tryptic restriction, fixed mass shift for modification of carboxyamidomethylated Cys (+ 57.0215 Da), dynamic mass shifts for oxidized Met (+ 15.9949 Da), three maximal modification sites and three maximal missed cleavages. Only b and y ions were considered during the database match. To evaluate false discovery rate during the spectrum-peptide matching, all original protein sequences were reversed to generate a decoy database that was concatenated to the original database. Related RNA-seq files have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive database with accession SRA060572.

### Publication Abstract
Deposition of insoluble protein aggregates is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. The universal presence of &#x3b2;-amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has facilitated advancement of the amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses that have dominated AD pathogenesis research and therapeutic development. However, the underlying etiology of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. Here we report a comprehensive study of the human brain-insoluble proteome in AD by mass spectrometry. We identify 4,216 proteins, among which 36 proteins accumulate in the disease, including U1-70K and other U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) spliceosome components. Similar accumulations in mild cognitive impairment cases indicate that spliceosome changes occur in early stages of AD. Multiple U1 snRNP subunits form cytoplasmic tangle-like structures in AD but not in other examined neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Comparison of RNA from AD and control brains reveals dysregulated RNA processing with accumulation of unspliced RNA species in AD, including myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1, clusterin, and presenilin-1. U1-70K knockdown or antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of U1 snRNP increases the protein level of amyloid precursor protein. Thus, our results demonstrate unique U1 snRNP pathology and implicate abnormal RNA splicing in AD pathogenesis.
