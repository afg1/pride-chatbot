### Title
Galectin-3 and prohibitin 1 are autoantigens in IgG4-related cholangitis without protective effects against toxic bile acids

### Description
IgG4-related cholangitis (IRC) is the hepatobiliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease, a systemic B-cell-driven fibroinflammatory disorder. Four autoantigens have recently been described in IgG4-RD; annexin A11, galectin-3, laminin 511-E8, and prohibitin 1. We have previously reported a protective role of annexin A11 and laminin 511-E8 in human cholangiocytes against toxic bile acids. Here we explored a potentially protective role of the carbohydrate binding lectin galectin-3 and the scaffold proteins prohibitin 1 and 2.

### Sample Protocol
Precipitated proteins were denatured with 8 M urea in 1 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) (10mM) at room temperature for 30min after which the cysteines were alkylated with chloroacetamide (40mM end concentration) for 30min. After fourfold dilution with ABC, proteins were on-bead digested overnight at room temperature with 150ng of Trypsin/LysC (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin USA), after which peptides were bound to an in-housemade c18 stage tip, washed with 0.1% formic acid (buffer C) and stored at 4˚C until liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) analysis.After elution from the stage tips, acetonitrile (ACN) was removed from the samples using a SpeedVac and the remaining peptide solution was diluted with buffer C before loading. Peptides were separated on a 30cm pico-tip column (50µm ID, New Objective/Ms Wil, Zurich, Switzerland) in-house packed with 3µm aquapur gold C-18 material (Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a 140min or 200 gradient (7% to 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid), delivered by an easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and electro-sprayed directly into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The latter was set in data-dependent Top speed mode with a cycle time of 1s, in which the full scan over the 400–1500 mass range was performed at a resolution of 240000. Most intense ions (intensity threshold of 5000 ions) were isolated by the quadrupole and fragmented with an higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energy of 30%. The maximum injection time of the ion trap was set to 35 ms.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed with the Maxquant software (V.1.5.2.8) with deamidation of glutamine and asparagine as well as oxidation of methionine set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine set as fixed modification. The Human protein database of Uniprot was searched with both the peptide as well as the protein false discovery rate set to 1%. The intensity-based absolute quantification (IBAQ) and the label-free quantification (LFQ) quantification algorithms were used in combination with the ‘match between runs’ tool (option set at 2min), all of which are integral parts of the Maxquant software.22
