### Title
Alterations in the membrane-associated proteome of alveolar macrophages in sarcoidosis

### Description
Here we have performed qualitative profiling of the membrane-associated proteome of alveolar macrophages in sarcoidosis patients and healthy individuals with the aim to identify specific proteins and pathways involved in sarcoidosis pathology.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were digested with trypsin, labeled with 8plex iTRAQ and separated by isoelectric focusing before LC-MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos.

### Data Protocol
MSMS data was searched using Sequest/Percolator under Proteome Discoverer 1.3 against the human subset of the swissprot FASTA database (2013-05-15, 38486 entries). Variable mods: oxidation of methionine. Fixed mods: carbamidomethylation of cysteine, iTRAQ8plex on N-terminus and on lysine side chains.
