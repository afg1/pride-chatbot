### Title
LC-MS/MS of proteomics in human ovarian cancer versus control samples

### Description
We investigated how the proteome changed in human patients with ovarian cancer compared with healthy individuals.

### Sample Protocol
Each sample was extracted using SDS buffer and subjected to trypsin digestion. Resulting peptides were analyzed using LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were searched against UniProt Homo sapiens database using MaxQuant and LFQ was used for protein quantification. Perseus was used for statistical analysis.
