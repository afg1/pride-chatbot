### Title
Mass spectrum for FLAG-tagged C7orf26 in HeLa cells

### Description
Identify the protein-protein interactions associated with a novel protein, C7orf26, in HeLa cells.

### Sample Protocol
For Immunoprecipitation based mass spectrometry, 2*10^7 parental HeLa cells or C7orf26-FLAG-expressing HeLa cells were lysated with HS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 20% Glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) on ice for 30 min followed by centrifuge at max g for 20 min in 4-degree centrifuge. Soluble extracts were diluted with BC-300 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 300 mM KCl, 20% Glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) overnight at 4-degree with rotation. Beads were washed five times with BC-300 buffer + 0.1% NP-40 and one time with BC-100 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 20% Glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) + 0.1% NP-40. 8 M Urea in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 was used for elution.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis was performed with Scaffold Proteome Software.
