### Title
Characterization of the skeletal muscle proteome in under-nourished old rats

### Description
Therefore, undernutrition is common in the elderly where its prevalence varies from 4 to 10% at home, from 15 to 30% in care homes and reaches 30 to 70% in hospitals de-pending on the diagnostic criteria used [10]. Most of all, aging impairs the ability to adapt to undernutrition leading to severe loss of body weight and muscle [11-14]. In particular, old rats exhibit defective adaptation to long-term 50% dietary restriction initiated at an advanced age, resulting in dramatic body weight loss and deregulation of protein metabolism in terms of nitrogen balance and protein content, especially at skeletal muscle level [12]. Therefore, in elderly patients, undernutrition exacerbates the state of frailty and dependence, greatly increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality [15]. This is even more critical that the world aging population is growing up. Accord-ing to United Nations statistics on the demographic trend in aging population, the proportion of persons aged 65 or over in the world is projected to reach nearly 16% in 2050, compared to 9% in 2019 [16]. Specific studies are needed to better understand the undernutrition-induced skeletal muscle alterations in order to identify new therapeu-tic targets and prevent sarcopenia in the old population

### Sample Protocol
In order to increase our understanding of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, we characterized the undernutrition-induced skeletal muscle proteome changes in old rats.For this study, twenty-month-old male rats were fed with 50% or 100% of their spontaneous intake for 12 weeks and a proteomic analysis has been performed on both fast- and slow-contracting muscles.

### Data Protocol
Quantification by label-free(progenesisQI)and identification by MASCOT and Peaks.

### Publication Abstract
Aging is associated with a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function termed sarcopenia. Various metabolic alterations that occur with aging also increase the risk of undernutrition, which can worsen age-related sarcopenia. However, the impact of undernutrition on aged skeletal muscle remains largely under-researched. To build a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying age-related sarcopenia, we characterized the undernutrition-induced changes in the skeletal muscle proteome in old rats. For this study, 20-month-old male rats were fed 50% or 100% of their spontaneous intake for 12 weeks, and proteomic analysis was performed on both slow- and fast-twitch muscles. Proteomic profiling of undernourished aged skeletal muscle revealed that undernutrition has profound effects on muscle proteome independently of its effect on muscle mass. Undernutrition-induced changes in muscle proteome appear to be muscle-type-specific: slow-twitch muscle showed a broad pattern of differential expression in proteins important for energy metabolism, whereas fast-twitch muscle mainly showed changes in protein turnover between undernourished and control rats. This first proteomic analysis of undernourished aged skeletal muscle provides new molecular-level insight to explain phenotypic changes in undernourished aged muscle. We anticipate this work as a starting point to define new biomarkers associated with undernutrition-induced muscle loss in the elderly.
