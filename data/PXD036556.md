### Title
Drosophila S2s Elongator identification

### Description
A collection of stable Drosophila S2 cell lines was established, each one expressing a (His)-PC SNAP tagged version of each of the six Elongator subunits. From these stable lines, the endogenous Elongator complex can be recovered by pulling on the exogenous subunit via the PC tag. This allowed us to test which subunit can be over-expressed and used to recover the full Elongator complex for further in vitro experiments.

### Sample Protocol
Polyacrylamide gel slices (1-2 mm) containing the purified proteins were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis by manual in situ enzymatic digestion.   Briefly, the excised protein gel pieces were placed in a well of a 96-well microtitre plate and destained with 50% v/v acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with 10 mM DTT, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide.   After alkylation, proteins were digested with 6 ng/µL Trypsin (Promega, UK) overnight at 37 °C.   The resulting peptides were extracted in 2% v/v formic acid, 2% v/v acetonitrile.   The digest was analysed by nano-scale capillary LC-MS/MS using a Ultimate U3000 HPLC (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA) to deliver a flow of approximately 300 nL/min.  A C18 Acclaim PepMap100 5 µm, 100 µm x 20 mm nanoViper (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA), trapped the peptides prior to separation on a C18 Acclaim PepMap100 3 µm, 75 µm x 150 mm nanoViper (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile.  The analytical column outlet was directly interfaced via a modified nano-flow electrospray ionisation source, with a hybrid dual pressure linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Velos, ThermoScientific, San Jose, USA).

### Data Protocol
Data dependent analysis was carried out, using a resolution of 30,000 for the full MS spectrum, followed by ten MS/MS spectra in the linear ion trap.  MS spectra were collected over a m/z range of 300–2000.  MS/MS scans were collected using a threshold energy of 35 for collision induced dissociation.  LC-MS/MS data were then searched against an in house protein sequence database, containing Swiss-Prot and the protein constructs specific to the experiment, using the Mascot search engine programme (Matrix Science, UK) .  Database search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 5 ppm and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.8 Da.  Two missed enzyme cleavages were allowed and variable modifications for oxidized methionine, carbamidomethyl cysteine, pyroglutamic acid, phosphorylated serine, threonine, tyrosine, tert-butyloxycarbonyl-lysine, norbornene-lysine and prop-2-yn-1-yloxycarbonyl-lysine were included.  MS/MS data were validated using the Scaffold programme (Proteome Software Inc., USA).  All data were additionally interrogated manually.
