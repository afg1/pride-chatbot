### Title
Developmental proteomics of wild-type and K6W-Ub mouse congenital cataractous lenses

### Description
Whole lenses were dissected from E15.5, P1, or P30 wild-type C57BL/6J mice or from K6W-Ub transgenic mice, which develop congenital cataracts. Lens homogenates were subjected to quantitative proteomic analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling.

### Sample Protocol
Three 7-plex isobaric tagging experiments were conducted. For each 7-plex, lens homogenates from WT or K6W-Ub mutant mice were digested and labeled with TMT reagents as follows: P1 WT – 127N, P1 K6W – 127C, P30 WT – 128N, P30 K6W – 128C, E15.5 WT – 129N, E15.5 K6W – 129C. A reference sample consisting of a mixture of protein homogenates from all groups was labeled with TMT reagent 126. Peptides were combined, fractionated using high pH reverse phase fractionation, and peptide fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were searched against a database containing the Mus musculus subset of the UniprotKB database using SequestHT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific). Percolator validation was performed with a 1% false discovery rate.
