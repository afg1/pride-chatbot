### Title
Characterization of mitochondrial proteome in human langherans cells

### Description
Please provide an overall description of your study, think something similar in scope to the manuscript abstractPhysical and functional interactions between the cells and their substrate, defined as mechanotransduction, still represent a developing frontier of life sciences, despite the growing consensus for the relevance in the control of gene regulation and cell state. In this framework, the overall goal of this project was to identify and functionally characterise at the molecular level the mechanotransductive pathways, connecting the cellular microenvironment and the nucleus of Langherans cells, and to monitor the accompanying modulations in mitochondrial-related cell energetics by a proteomic approach.

### Sample Protocol
Reduction and alkylation Digestion (trypsin sequence grade) nanoLC-MS/MS

### Publication Abstract
Recently, using cluster-assembled zirconia substrates with tailored roughness produced by supersonic cluster beam deposition, we demonstrated that &#x3b2; cells can sense nanoscale features of the substrate and can translate these stimuli into a mechanotransductive pathway capable of preserveing &#x3b2;-cell differentiation and function <i>in vitro</i> in long-term cultures of human islets. Using the same proteomic approach, we now focused on the mitochondrial fraction of &#x3b2;TC3 cells grown on the same zirconia substrates and characterized the morphological and proteomic modifications induced by the nanostructure. The results suggest that, in &#x3b2;TC3 cells, mitochondria are perturbed by the nanotopography and activate a program involving metabolism modification and modulation of their interplay with other organelles. Data were confirmed in INS1E, a different &#x3b2;-cell model. The change induced by the nanostructure can be pro-survival and prime mitochondria for a metabolic switch to match the new cell needs.
