### Title
Global proteomic analysis of Tibetan swine serum during early pregnancy stage-DIA

### Description
Data-independent acquisition -based (DIA) quantitative proteomic was performed to compare the serum proteome profiles on days 0, 5, 12, 16, and 19 of gestation in Tibetan swine, bioinformatics analysis was subsequently taken to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)

### Sample Protocol
The jugular vein was punctured on days 0, 5, 12, 16, and 19 of pregnancy. The blood was subsequently stored at room temperature for one hour, followed by serum separation by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min. Sera were mixed with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) before long-term storage in liquid nitrogen until proteomic analysis.

### Data Protocol
These reserved peptides and proteins were further analyzed to remove data with false discovery rate (FDR) values larger than 0.01. A t-test was applied to judge the significance of relative quantitative differences between different comparisons. Proteins with a fold change (Selby et al.) ≥1.2 or ≤ 0.83 and a P-value < 0.05 were defined as DEPs.
