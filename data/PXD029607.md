### Title
LETM1 interactome determined using a minaturised approach

### Description
The interactome of LETM1 was determined by AP-MS in a minaturised approach. The miniaturisation was validated against a MCU core interactome.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes were reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin as described. Peptides were desalted and concentrated by reversed-phase tips and reconstituted in formic acid (5%) for LC-MS analysisAll liquid chromatography mass spectrometry experiments were performed on an Aglient 1200 HPLC nanoflow system coupled to a linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were matched to peptides and proteins using Mascot and Phenyx, with a false discovery rate of 1% at the protein level.
