### Title
S. aciditrophicus -  Pyrophosphate-Dependent ATP Formation from Acetyl Coenzyme A in Syntrophus aciditrophicus, a New Twist on ATP Formation

### Description
We utilize a harsh mass-spectrometry compatible sample preparation method (eFASP), and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, to collect a comprehensive inventory of proteins and the degree of differential regulation based on growth condition

### Sample Protocol
Syntrophus aciditrophicus was co-cultured either with or without M. hungatei JF-1. Cultures were grown with 20 mM crotonate. S.aciditrophicus cells were isolated form M. hungatei cells by Percol separation. Harvested cells from the different conditions were washed with PBS three times, and the pellets weighed. Sample pellets were processed by eFASP. Digested peptides were fractionated offline with HILIC before being analyzed by LC-MSMS

### Data Protocol
Data from 5 fractions were combined and submitted together for the search. Database search settings included two missed cleavages, a 4% false positive rate, fixed S-pyridylethyl modification of cysteine residues, and variable oxidation modification of methionine residues.
