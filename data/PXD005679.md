### Title
Proteome expression changes upon Halofuginone treatment

### Description
NHCF-V primary cardiac fibroblasts where treated for 24 hours with either 1) 100nM Halofuginone (TMT labels 126 and 129L) 2) 300nM Halofuginone (TMT labels 127L and 129H) 3) 300 nM Halofuginone + 4 mM L-Pro (TMT labels 127H and 130L) 4) DMSO (TMT labels 128H and 131)

### Sample Protocol
NHCF-V cells were treated with 100nM, 300nM halofuginone and 300nM halofuginone with 4-mM L- proline or DMSO for 24hrs. Cell layers were lysed in 2% SDS, peptides were labeled with 10-plex TMT (TMT10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) reagents, fractionated on an Ultimate3000 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) by using reversed-phase chromatography at pH 12 [1 mm Xbridge column (Waters, Milford, MA)]. Peptide fragments were detected by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using our in-house built analysis pipeline. Protein identification was done using mascot and the IPI protein database
