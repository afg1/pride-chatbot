### Title
Proteomic Analysis of Stationary Growth Stage and Nutritional Deficiency Adaptation Reveals Brucella Abortus Virulence Mechanisms

### Description
Brucellosis, an important bacterial zoonosis caused by Brucella species, has drawn increased attention around the world. As an intracellular pathogen, the ability of Brucella to deal with stress within the host cell is closely related to its virulence. The survival pressure on Brucella within a phagosome is considered similar to that during the stationary phase. Here, label-free proteomics approach was used to study the adaptive response of Brucella abortus (B. abortus) in the stationary stage. 182 down-regulated and 140 up-regulated proteins were found in the stationary-phase B. abortus. B. abortus adapted to adverse environmental changes by regulating virulence, reproduction, transcription, translation, stress response, and energy production. In addition, both logarithmic and stationary-phase B. abortus were treated with short-term starvation. The logarithmic-phase B. abortus restricted cell reproduction and energy utilization in response to nutritional stress. Additionally, the expression levels of some virulence-related proteins were identified as being significantly regulated during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase or under starvation treatment, such as Type IV secretion system protein (T4SS), VjbR, and integration host factor (IHF). Altogether, we outlined adaptive mechanisms that B. abortus could employ during the growth and compared the differences between logarithmic and stationary-phase B. abortus in response to starvation.

### Sample Protocol
Brucella strains and experimental design  Virulent B. abortus 2308 was obtained from Tecon Biological Co., Ltd (Urumqi，China) and cultured in tryptone soya agar (TSA) or tryptone soya broth (TSB). All experiments related to live B. abortus 2308 were conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories. A single colony of Brucella was obtained using the streak plate method. The colonies were cultured in TSB medium in a shaking incubator set at 37 °C. Bacteria were cultured to logarithmic (OD600 = 1.0) and stationary (OD600 = 2.0) growth stages and then harvested. The GEM medium was used for starvation treatment of B. abortus. The components of the GEM medium are as follows: MgSO4•7H20 (0.2 g/L), citric acid• H2O (2.0 g/L), K2HPO4 (10.0 g/L), NaNH4HPO4•4H2O (3.5 g/L), and glucose (20 g/L) [13]. The cells harvested from the logarithmic or stationary growth stage were resuspended in the GEM medium and then incubated at 37 °C by shaking the incubator for 1.5 hours. The pH values of all media in this study were adjusted to 7.0. The logarithmic-phase and stationary-phase B. abortus cultured separately in TSB medium were called TSBL and TSBS, respectively. The logarithmic-phase and stationary-phase B. abortus cultures treated with starvation were called GEML and GEMS, respectively.   Protein extraction and digestion  Cells were harvested, centrifuged (7,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min), and then washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer, placed on ice, and lysed on the ice through ultrasonic wave breaking. When the lysate became clear, it was centrifuged (40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min). A protein quantification kit based on bicinchoninic acid method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) was used for concentration detection of protein in the supernatant. The cell protein extracts were reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 30 minutes. Then, the reduced cell protein extracts were added to iodoacetamide and incubated at room temperature away from light for 15 minutes. Finally, trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 (trypsin:protein, w/w), and the protein solution was digested overnight at 37 °C. Trypsin was added again at a ratio of 1:100 (trypsin:protein, w/w) for a second 4-hour digestion. For each condition, three biological replicates were sampled for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.  High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation   The tryptic samples were fractionated into fractions by high-pH reverse HPLC with Agilent 300 Extend C18 (5-μm particles, 4.6-mm ID, and 250-mm length). The operation was as follows: peptides were separated with a gradient of 8% to 32% acetonitrile (pH = 9.0) into 60 fractions over 60 min; then, the peptides were combined into 4 fractions and dried by vacuum centrifuging for further operation.  LC-MS/MS analysis   The tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A) and then separated using EASY-nLC 1200 Ultra High Performance Liquid System. Solvent A contained 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile, while solvent B contained 0.1% formic acid and 90% acetonitrile. Gradient settings were as follows: 0–30 min, 8–16% solvent B; 30–55 min, 18–32% solvent B; 55–57 min, 32–80% solvent B; and 57–60 min, 80% solvent B. The flow rate was maintained at 400 nL/min.  The peptides were subjected to a nano electrospray ionization (NSI) source and then analyzed by Orbitrap FusionTM Lumos mass spectrometry (MS). The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. The peptides were selected for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using normalized collision energy setting as 30, and ion fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans was applied for the top 20 precursor ions above a threshold ion count of 5E4 in the MS survey scan, with 30.0 s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control (AGC) was used to prevent overﬁlling of the ion trap; the 5E4 ions were accumulated for the generation of MS/MS spectra. For MS scans, the m/z scan range was 350–1550. 

### Data Protocol
Database search  The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched were searched against the UniProt B. abortus（3,023 sequences） database concatenated with the reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as the cleavage enzyme allowing up to two missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions of the first search and main search were set to 20 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively. The mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on cysteine was specified as fixed modification and oxidation on methionine, N-terminal acetylation of proteins and deamidation of asparagine were specified as variable modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) for protein identification and peptides and modification sites were set at 1%.  Bioinformatic analysis  Gene Ontology (GO) annotation proteome was derived from the Genebank database (https://cipotato.org/genebankcip/). Then proteins were classiﬁed by GO annotation based on three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to annotate the pathways of the identified proteins. The Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) system software program was used to determine the functional distribution of identified proteins.

### Publication Abstract
Brucellosis, an important bacterial zoonosis caused by <i>Brucella</i> species, has drawn increasing attention worldwide. As an intracellular pathogen, the ability of <i>Brucella</i> to deal with stress within the host cell is closely related to its virulence. Due to the similarity between the survival pressure on <i>Brucella</i> within host cells and that during the stationary phase, a label-free proteomics approach was used to study the adaptive response of <i>Brucella abortus</i> in the stationary stage to reveal the possible intracellular adaptation mechanism in this study. A total of 182 downregulated and 140 upregulated proteins were found in the stationary-phase <i>B. abortus</i>. <i>B. abortus</i> adapted to adverse environmental changes by regulating virulence, reproduction, transcription, translation, stress response, and energy production. In addition, both exponential- and stationary-phase <i>B. abortus</i> were treated with short-term starvation. The exponential <i>B. abortus</i> restricted cell reproduction and energy utilization and enhanced material transport in response to nutritional stress. Compared with the exponential phase, stationary <i>Brucella</i> adjusted their protein expression to a lesser extent under starvation. Therefore, <i>B. abortus</i> in the two growth stages significantly differed in the regulation of protein expression in response to the same stress. Overall, we outlined the adaptive mechanisms that <i>B. abortus</i> may employ during growth and compared the differences between exponential- and stationary-phase <i>B. abortus</i> in response to starvation.
