### Title
eEF2K activity determines synergy to PI3K and MEK inhibitors in combination in cancer cells

### Description
To understand the mechanisms involved in synergy to PI3Ki + MEKi treatment, we performed a global phosphoproteomics analysis in 3 different cancer cell lines treated with a MEK inhibitor (Trametinib) and a PI3K inhibitor (Pictilisib) at 500 nM individually or in combination for one hour.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed in 8 M urea buffer. This concentration was reduced to 2 M with 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0) and proteins were digested with trypsin. Peptide solutions were desalted using Oasis-HLB cartridges and phosphopeptides enriched using TiO2.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using Mascot. Label-free quantification was performed using Pescal, a in-house developed software that uses extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for all the peptides identified in at least one sample across all samples.
