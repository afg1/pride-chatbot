### Title
Target Peptide Identification for the Detection of Soy Proteins in Foods Using Parallel Reaction Monitoring

### Description
The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate the performance of target peptide for the detection of soy protein in a cookie matrix using parallel reaction monitoring.

### Sample Protocol
Six soy ingredients were extracted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, with 6 M Urea, 20 mM DTT, and 1% PVPP, and then prepared for LC-MS/MS by in solution tryptic digestion and C18 spin column cleanup. Samples were separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed in top 10 discovery MS/MS mode using a Q Exactive™ Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Protein and peptide identification was performed on Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.1.21), allowing a 1% false discovery rate. The identification is based on a customized protein database, which is the combination of all Glycine max protein sequences and common lab contaminant protein sequences (Protein sequences of Glycine max were acquired from UniProt and the contaminants database from The Global Proteome Machine). The search parameters allowed two missed tryptic cleavages, static carbamidomethyl (C), and variable oxidation (M) modifications. Label-free quantification was conducted based on peak area information acquired from Skyline (version 3.5.0.9319) using the same parameter settings.
