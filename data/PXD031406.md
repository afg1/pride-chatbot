Total proteome analysis of A549 IFNR knockout and HepG2 cells

### Description
Total proteome analysis of A549 IFNR knockout and HepG2 cells

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (4% SDS, 10 mM DTT in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail), boiled at 95°C for 8 min and sonicated for 15 min at 4°C (Bioruptor). Alkylation of proteins was performed for 20 min in the dark by addition of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), followed by normalization of the protein concentration (Pierce 660nm Protein Assay). For each replicate, 50 µg proteins were precipitated with 4 volumes of pre-chilled acetone at -20°C overnight, pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C), washed with 80% (v/v) acetone, air-dried and resuspended in 40 µl thiourea buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0). Proteins were pre-digested by addition of 1 µg LysC in 40 µl 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) buffer (pH 8.0) for 3 h at 25°C. Digestion was completed with 1 µg Trypsin in 120 µl 50 mM ABC buffer (pH 8.0) for 16 h at 25°C. Following purification on C18 StageTips as described previously [https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2007.261], peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm reverse-phase analytical column (75 µm column diameter; ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin; Dr. Maisch) and separated using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A binary buffer system consisting of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in H2O) with a 180 min gradient (5-30% buffer B for 150 min, 30-95% buffer B for 20 min, wash out at 95% buffer B for 5 min, readjustment to 5% buffer B for 5 min) was used at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with repeating cycles of one MS1 full scan (300-1,650 m/z, R=120,000 at 200 m/z) at an ion target of 3e6, followed by 15 MS2 scans of the highest abundant isolated and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmented peptide precursors (R=15,000 at 200 m/z). Peptide precursor isolation for MS2 scans was additionally limited by a maximum injection time of 25 ms and an ion target of 1e5 while repeated isolation of the same precursor was dynamically excluded for 20 s.

### Data Protocol
Spectra were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.43) using label-free quantification, match between runs, fixed carbamidometylation and variable N-acetylation and methionine oxidation. Peptides and proteins were identified by searching against the human proteome sequences (UniprotKB) controlled by a false discovery rate of 0.01
