### Title
Systems Biology Proteomic Analysis of Cerebral Cavernous Malformation

### Description
Cerebral cavernous malformations are vascular anomalies that can cause hemorrhagic stroke.  Mutations in genes encoding Krit 1 (CCM1), OSM (CCM2), and PDCD10 (CCM3) proteins cause CCM.  A loss in teh expression of any of these CCM proteins disrupts normal cerebral vessel development by disrupting the cytoskeleton and thereby inhibits endothelial tube ofrmation.  Examination  of cellular changes based on the loss of CCM gene expression may lead to the methods for early detection and prevention of CCM associated hemorrhagic stroke.
