### Title
partial-nitritation anammox reactor

### Description
Identify and characterize two distinct communities, the aerobic community and the anaerobic community in the partial nitritation/anammox reactors using metaproteomics approach

### Sample Protocol
Sludge samples were concentrated to 7000 mg vss/L for protein extraction. The total proteins were extracted using the modified B-PER extraction method. Proteins were precipitated using a 5-fold volume acidified acetone/ethanol buffer and washed 3 times with ice-cold acetone. The protein pellets were re-suspended in 6M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for trypsin digestion.

### Data Protocol
A metagenomic taxonomy-guided database search strategy was used for microbial protein identification. Briefly, a protein database was generated by combining (1) gene catalog predicted from matched metagenomic sequencing; (2) UniprotKB protein entries of all genera/families identified from shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The combined database was then used for microbial protein identification and quantification using MetaPro-IQ approach.
