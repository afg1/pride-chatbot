### Title
rat, urine, LC-MS/MS -  Two predominant MUPs, OBP3 and MUP13, are male pheromones in rats

### Description
Two MUPs of rat urine, odorant-binding protein 3 (OBP3) and MUP13, were identified by LC-MS/MS,and found to be male-biased and androgen-dependent and then confirmed to be male pheromones in rats.

### Sample Protocol
We used the IEF method to separate the MUPs in male rat urine, and then selected the three most abundant bands to perform the In-gel digestion. After that, the extracted peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The raw MS data was analysed by the Proteome Discoverer software system (version 1.4.0.288; Thermo Scientific, USA) and searched against the Rattus norvegicus database (SwissProt, 2012). The matching proteins with a high peptide confidence for at least one unique peptide were considered significant, and the acrylamide modification of cysteines and methionine oxidation were set as fixed and dynamic modifications, respectively.
