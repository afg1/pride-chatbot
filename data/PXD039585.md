### Title
Advanced mass spectrometry workflows for accurate quantification of trace-level host cell proteins in drug products: benefits of FAIMS separation and gas-phase fractionation DIA

### Description
In this study, we investigated the benefits of adding high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation prior to data dependent acquisition (DDA) and gas phase fractionation (GPF) prior to data independent acquisition (DIA) LC-MS/MS analysis. Native digestion followed by LC-MS/MS with FAIMS allowed the identification of 221 HCPs among which 158 were reliably quantified for a global amount of 880 ng/mg of NIST mAb Reference Material. Our methods have also been applied to commercial DPs and demonstrate their ability to dig deeper into the HCP landscape with the identification of 60 and 67 HCPs, and accurate quantification of 29 and 31 of these impurities in nivolumab and trastuzumab respectively, with sensitivity down to the sub-ng/mg of mAb level

### Sample Protocol
Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analyses were performed on an Ultimate 3000 UPLC device (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

### Data Protocol
DDA data was analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (v. 2.5; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using Sequest HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a FASTA of Mus musculus (17,050 entries, 2021/05/26) from SwissProt for NIST mAb and Cricetulus Griseus (78,366 entries, 2022/03/15) FASTA files extracted from UniProt/TrEMBL for commercial mAbs, as well as the retention time standards, the standards for quantification, the mAb heavy and light chains and the common contaminants. Trypsin/P was used as digestion enzyme and one missed cleavage was allowed. Oxidation of methionine and acetylation of protein N-term were set as variable modifications. Data was extracted using peptide mass tolerance of 5 ppm and MS/MS mass tolerance at 0.5 Da. A false discovery rate of 1% was set at PSM and peptide levels. XIC-MS1 quantification was performed using unique peptides and the chromatographic alignment was fixed to 10 min and 10 ppm between replicates.

### Publication Abstract
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) production relies on multiple purification steps before release as a drug product (DP). A few host cell proteins (HCPs) may co-purify with the mAb. Their monitoring is crucial due to the considerable risk they represent for mAb stability, integrity, and efficacy and their potential immunogenicity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) commonly used for global HCP monitoring present limitations in terms of identification and quantification of individual HCPs. Therefore, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as a promising alternative. Challenging DP samples show an extreme dynamic range requiring high performing methods to detect and reliably quantify trace-level HCPs. Here, we investigated the benefits of adding high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation and gas phase fractionation (GPF) prior to data independent acquisition (DIA). FAIMS LC-MS/MS analysis allowed the identification of 221 HCPs among which 158 were reliably quantified for a global amount of 880&#xa0;ng/mg of NIST mAb Reference Material. Our methods have also been successfully applied to two FDA/EMA approved DPs and allowed digging deeper into the HCP landscape with the identification and quantification of a few tens of HCPs with sensitivity down to the sub-ng/mg of mAb level.
