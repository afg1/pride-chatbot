### Title
Proteomic Analysis by iTRAQ-MRM of Soybean Resistance to Lamprosema Indicate

### Description
This study was conducted to: (1)comparative analysis of expression profiles of proteins in soybean leaf(a highly resistant line (Gantai-2-2) and a highly susceptible line (Wan 82-178) were exposed to Lamprosema indicate larval feedings for 0 h and 48 h);(2)explore how these proteins participated in the responses to resistance;(3) aim at resolving the soybeansâ€™ constitutive and inducible defense mechanisms in response to Lamprosema indicate at the proteomic level.

### Sample Protocol
1.Protein extracted by TCA method 2.Protein digested by trypsin 3.Peptide labelled by iTRAQ Reagent 8-plex Kit 4.The iTRAQ labeled peptides were fractionated using SCX 5.Each fraction analyzed by LC-MSMS base on AB5600.

### Data Protocol
All mass spectra data were searched by mascot_v2.3.02 against Glycine_max proteome  database.
