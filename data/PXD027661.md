### Title
Hunam gut microbiome metaproteomcis  in LP1

### Description
The samples of gut micorbiota were collected in "Lunar Palace 365" experiment. The "Lunar Palace 365" experiment was a 370-day, multicrew, closed experiment carried out in a ground-based experimental BLSS platform named Lunar Palace 1. Deep metaproteomics data analysis was then performed for better understanding the role of gut micorbiota in mood regulation.

### Sample Protocol
The microbial cells were collected with differential centrifugation and lysed with 4%SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Protein and peptide identification and quantification was performed with MetaPro-IQ workflow implemented in MetaLab platform (http://imetalab.ca/).
