### Title
Proteogenomics of a Chernobyl's Microbacterium sp. A9 bacterial isolate

### Description
This project is a proteomic comparison of Microbacterium sp. A9 exposed to 10 ÂµM nitrate uranyl versus control condition without uranyl. Three sampling time points (30 min, 4h and 24h)are analyzed.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE, sliced into polyacrylamide bands, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
