### Title
CHIP phosphorylation regulates proteostasis

### Description
Proteotoxicity from insufficient clearance of misfolded/damaged proteins underlies many diseases. Carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis in many cells, having E3-ligase and chaperone functions and often directing damaged proteins towards proteasome recycling. While enhancing CHIP functionality has broad therapeutic potential, prior efforts have all relied on genetic upregulation. Here we demonstrate that CHIP-mediated protein turnover is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation at S20 (mouse, S19 human). This increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein halflife, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. PKGmediated CHIP-pS20 or expressing CHIP-S20E (phosphomimetic) reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A amplifies both. In vivo, depressing PKG activity lowers CHIP-S20 phosphorylation and protein, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury. CHIP-S20E knock-in mice better clear ubiquitinated proteins and are cardio-protected. PKG activation provides post-translational enhancement of protein quality control via CHIP.

### Sample Protocol
Mouse Models Studies used mice (C57BL6/J background) with myocyte-specific PDE5A overexpression under control of an α-MHC tetracycline-inducible promoter24 and their littermate controls. We also generated a new global knock-mouse expressing CHIP S20E/S24E (SE) (Supplemental Figure 1) using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting/insertion methods (Transgenic Mouse Core Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, details in Supplemental Methods). Myocardial Infarction (MI) Male and female mice (aged ~3-4 months) were subjected to transmural myocardial infarction by mid left anterior descending artery ligation under open thoracotomy25. Controls underwent open chest surgery and LAD isolation without ligation. Data obtained 1-week after infarction included 2D echocardiography (Vevo2100, 20-MHz; Visualsonics) in conscious mice to measure LV volume and ejection fraction, with analysis blinded to study group. The protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. Cultured cardiomyocyte studies Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were prepared as described26. After overnight culture, subsets of NRCMs were infected with adenovirus (AdV) containing a FLAG-tagged PDE5, FLAG control, Myc-tagged CHIP WT or K31A (provided by Dr. Cam Patterson), S20E or S20A (Welgen Inc., Worcester, MA).  Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were exposed to either simulated ischemia (SI) or normal conditions. SI involved incubating cells in DMEM containing deoxyglucose (20 mM), NaCl (125 mM), KCl (8 mM), KH2PO4 (1.2 mM), MgSO4 (1.25 mM), CaCl2 (1.2 mM), NaHCO3 (6.25 mM), sodium lactate (5 mM), and HEPES (20 mM) with a pH of 6.6. Cells were then placed in an incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) with 95% nitrogen, 4% carbon dioxide, and 1% oxygen. Normoxic controls were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in air composed of 95% carbon dioxide and 5% oxygen. RNA or protein was harvested after 48 hours of SI. Cells were also treated with sildenafil (1 μM) or vehicle, or small interference RNA (siRNA, 100 pM) specific for rat Stub1 (Qiagen, Cat. #: SI01532251) or scrambled control provided 24 hours after plating and transfected with Xfect (Takara) per manufacturer protocol. Protein analysis Tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes were lysed in 1X lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE using Novex Tris-Glycine Gels (4-20% gradient gel, Life Technologies) or Mini-protean TGX Gels (4-20% gradient gel, Bio- Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with various primary antibodies (CHIP (#2080S), Hsc70 (#8444S), p-CHIP S20 (Custom antibody, AbMart Inc., Shanghai, China; Project: 25011-1), Myc (#2276S), GAPDH (#2118S), and α- tubulin (#3878S) (Cell Signaling) and ubiquitin antibody (#SAB4503053) from Sigma), and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Licor, #926-32211, 926-32210, 926- 68023, or 926-68022). Gels were imaged (Odyssey, Licor) and band intensity quantified (Odyssey Software 3.1).

### Data Protocol
Data are presented by the individual experimental results along with mean ± SEM. Group comparisons were performed by 1- or 2-way ANOVA. Multiple comparisons testing was performed by Holm-Sidak or Tukey’s test using Prism 8 software. Data that were not normally distributed were assessed by non-parametric analysis (Kruskal Wallis) test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Sample sizes and individual statistical results for all analyses are provided in the figures or legends.
