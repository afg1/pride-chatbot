### Title
Quantitative changes in the Emiliania huxleyi proteome during recalcification

### Description
The aim was to assess quantitative changes in the Emiliania huxleyi protein as cells transitioned from a low calcium grown state in which they do not calcify, to hight calcium, calcifying condition.

### Sample Protocol
Low calcium grown cells were transferred to standard calcium or maintained in low calcium. Cell wer harcested at 0, 2, 3 or 6 hours after transfer, sonicated in an SDS sample buffer and, digested with a FASP protocol and labelledwith TMT isobaric tags.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using the phiolosopher / TMT-integrtor pipeline,using an artificial reference channel based on summation for normalization.
