### Title
Plasmodium falciparum PM X LC-MSMS

### Description
Plasmepsin X (PM X) is an aspartate protease expressed in the malaria parasie Plasmodium falciparum. Following synthesis PM X undergoes proteolytic processing. This project aims to understand the significance of PM X processing. To identify the cleavage sites, the processed PM X bands were excised from gels and subjected to LC-MSMS.

### Sample Protocol
The gel samples were destained, reduced and alkylated prior to trypsin digestion. Digest was aspirated and combined with further extraction of the gel piece with 60% acetonitrile (ACN) in 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The extracted peptides were dried down and each sample was resuspended in 10 µL 5% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA). 5 µL was analyzed by LC-MS with a Dionex RSLCnano HPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer using a 2 h gradient. Peptides were resolved in a 75 µm x 50 cm PepMap C18 column (Thermo Scientific) with following gradient: Time = 0–4 min, 2% B isocratic; 4–8 min, 2–10% B; 8–83 min, 10–25% B; 83–97 min, 25–50% B; 97–105 min, 50–98%. Mobile phase consisted of A, 0.1% FA; mobile phase B, 0.1% FA in ACN. The instrument was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode in which each MS1 scan was followed by Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of as many precursor ions in 2 second cycle (Top Speed method). The mass range for the MS1 done using the FTMS was 365 to 1800 m/z with resolving power set to 60,000 at 400 m/z and the automatic gain control (AGC) target set to 1,000,000 ions with a maximum fill time of 100 ms. The selected precursors were fragmented in the ion trap using an isolation window of 1.5 m/z, an AGC target value of 10,000 ions, a maximum fill time of 100 ms, a normalized collision energy of 35 and activation time of 30 ms. Dynamic exclusion was performed with a repeat count of 1, exclusion duration of 30 s, and a minimum MS ion count for triggering MS/MS set to 5000 counts.

### Data Protocol
All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.1.0). Mascot was set up to search against provided sequence along with common contaminants. The digestion enzyme was set as semiTrypsin (to account for nontryptic termini).  Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.60 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Oxidation of methionine, carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and acetylation of N-terminal of protein were specified in Mascot as variable modifications. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.8.2 Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established under 1% FDR by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm.

### Publication Abstract
The malaria parasite Plasmodium invades a host erythrocyte, multiplies within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and then ruptures the PV and erythrocyte membranes in a process known as egress. Both egress and invasion are controlled by effector proteins discharged from specialized secretory organelles. The aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PM X) regulates activity for many of these effectors, but it is unclear how PM X accesses its diverse substrates that reside in different organelles. PM X also autoprocesses to generate different isoforms. The function of this processing is not understood. We have mapped the self-cleavage sites and have constructed parasites with cleavage site mutations. Surprisingly, a quadruple mutant that remains full-length retains in vitro activity, is trafficked normally, and supports normal egress, invasion and parasite growth. The N-terminal half of the prodomain stays bound to the catalytic domain even after processing and is required for proper intracellular trafficking of PM X. We find that this enzyme cleaves microneme and exoneme substrates before discharge, while the rhoptry substrates that are dependent on PM X activity are cleaved after exoneme discharge into the PV. The data give insight into the temporal, spatial and biochemical control of this unusual but important aspartic protease.
