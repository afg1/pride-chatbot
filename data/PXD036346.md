### Title
BVES-HA IP-mass from AAV9-BVES-HA injected mouse skeletal muscle

### Description
To identify BVES-interacting proteins from mouse skeletal muscle, we performed IP-mass from AAV9-BVES-HA injected mouse skeletal muscle using the anti-HA magnetic beads.

### Sample Protocol
Gastrocnemius muscles from WT mice and BVES-KO mice with intramuscular injection of AAV9-BVES-3HA were lysed in the lysis buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Immunoprecipitation was performed byincubation with Pierce™ Anti-HA Magnetic Beads (#88836, ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1h at 4°C. The beads were washed for four times with the lysis buffer. Theimmunoprecipitated samples were first examined by Western blot and then subjected for mass spectrometric analysis at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center Proteomic Shared Resources.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS data were searched using Mascot Daemon by Matrix Science version 2.2.1 (Boston, MA) on a 16 node IBM blade system. Either the SwissProt database version 54.1 (283454 sequences; 104030551 residues) or NCBI database version 20071104 (5614267 sequences; 1941797005 residues) is used. Protein identifications are checked manually and proteins with a Mascot score of 50 or higher with a minimum of two unique peptides from one protein having a -b or -y ion sequence tag of five residues or better are accepted.
