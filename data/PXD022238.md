### Title
Time-series proteome profiling analysis of the atria in a murine model of angiotensin II-induced atrial fibrillation

### Description
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia observed in clinical cardiac diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and elevation of blood pressure have been considered to be the main risk regulators of AF. However, the time series proteome profiling and the key signaling pathways involved in the development of Ang II-induced AF remain unclear. Wild-type C57BL/6 male mice (10 weeks old) were infused with Ang II (2000 ng/kg/min) for 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. AF inducibility, left atrial volume and fibrosis were examined by echocardiography and histological staining. The time series proteome in atria tissues was evaluated with Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technologies. This study defined the dynamic changes of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) involved in Ang II-induced AF, and identified that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may play a key role in this disease. These findings provide a resource for understanding the molecular mechanism research of AF.

### Sample Protocol
Protein preparations Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg) administered via at weeks 1, 2, and 3 post Ang II infusion as previously described15. Five left atrial samples from each group were randomly selected for proteomics analysis. Each sample (50-60 mg) was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8M urine, 2 mM EDTA and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and then ultra-sonicated to isolated total proteins. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4℃. The protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. For digestion, the proteins (100 μg) were then reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56℃ for 30 min and subsequently alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 15 min at room temperature in dark. Samples were digested with trypsin (protein:trypsin:1:50; Promega, USA) at 37℃ for 16-20 h. Peptides were desalted by Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex), and then reconstituted in 0.5M TEAB (pH 8.5) dissolution buffer, and then labeled with different tandem mass tag (TMT)/iTRAQ kit reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.   LC-MS/MS Analysis The tryptic peptides were dissolved in solvent A containing 0.1% formic acid (FA), and directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (15-cm length, 75 μm i.d.). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 6% to 23% solvent B containing 0.1% FA in 98% acetonitrile at a constant flow rate of 400 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The dried peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Q ExactiveTM Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA) coupled online to the UPLC. The procedure was performed in positive ion mode with MS1 survey scan (m/z: 350 to 1800). The peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000, and then detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500. The separated peptides were analyzed with a data-dependent-acquisition mode on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap MS. The maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and MS/MS scans were 20 and 60 ms, respectively. Dynamic exclusion was set to with 15 s. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4. Fixed first mass was set as 100 m/z.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (version1.5.2.8). Proteins were identified by searching MS and MS/MS data against Decoy version of the complete proteome for the UniProt mouse database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in First search and 5 ppm in Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification and methionine oxidation was specified as variable modifications. For identification, peptides were filtered based on a q-value below 0.01. False discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted to < 1%, and minimum score for peptides was set > 40.
