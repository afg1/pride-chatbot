### Title
CRBN interactions - Protein interaction study using C-terminally tagged Cereblon

### Description
Protein interaction study using C-terminally tagged Cereblon

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitation of tagged Cereblon, identification of interaction partners by MS

### Data Protocol
Peptides generated by in-gel trypsin digestion were dried down and dissolved in 0.1% FA. LC-MS/MS was performed by coupling a nanoLC-Ultra (Eksigent) to a LTQ Orbitrap VelosXL  mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), using a 110 min gradient from 0 to 40% solution B (0.1% FA in AcN) as described 40,41.  For peptide and protein identification, peak lists were extracted from raw files using Mascot Distiller v2.2.1 (Matrix Science, UK) and subsequently searched against the Human IPI database (v 3.68, 87061 entries) using Mascot (v2.3.0) with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and phosphorylation of serine or threonine and oxidation of methionin as variable modifications. Precursor tolerance was set to 5 ppm and fragment ion tolerance to 0.02 Da. Trypsin/P was specified as the proteolytic enzyme with up to 2 missed cleavage sites allowed.
