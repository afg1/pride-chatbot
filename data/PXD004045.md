Epidermal Bladder Cell Quantitative Proteomics

### Description
Single cell type quantitative proteomic analysis was carried out on extract from epidermal bladder cells of the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum

### Sample Protocol
Both DIGE and GELC-MS/MS were used to identify salt-responsive proteins in Epidermal Bladder cells extracts.

### Data Protocol
Decyder software and Scaffold spectral counting analysis using multiple algorithms and approaches was used to identify salt responsive proteins
