### Title
Phosphotyrosine profiling of in vivo signaling changes in erlotinib-treated glioblastoma flank xenografts

### Description
Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics profiling of in vivo signaling changes in 16 GMB xenograft tumors treated with vehicle and erlotinib (5 mg/kg, 33 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg).

### Sample Protocol
Tumor homogenization by sonication in 8M urea followed by reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested into peptides using trypsin and desalted. Lyophilized peptides were labelled with TMT10-plex reagent. Phosphopeptides were enriched by phosphotyrosine immoprecipitation and immobolized metal ion chromotography (IMAC) before LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were loaded into Proteome Discoverer version 1.4.1.14  (Thermo) and searched against human SwissProt database (SwissProt_2015_09.fasta) using Mascot version 2.4.

### Publication Abstract
Therapeutic options for the treatment of glioblastoma remain inadequate despite concerted research efforts in drug development. Therapeutic failure can result from poor permeability of the blood-brain barrier, heterogeneous drug distribution, and development of resistance. Elucidation of relationships among such parameters could enable the development of predictive models of drug response in patients and inform drug development. Complementary analyses were applied to a glioblastoma patient-derived xenograft model in order to quantitatively map distribution and resulting cellular response to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Mass spectrometry images of erlotinib were registered to histology and magnetic resonance images in order to correlate drug distribution with tumor characteristics. Phosphoproteomics and immunohistochemistry were used to assess protein signaling in response to drug, and integrated with transcriptional response using mRNA sequencing. This comprehensive dataset provides simultaneous insight into pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and indicates that erlotinib delivery to intracranial tumors is insufficient to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling.
