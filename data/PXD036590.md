### Title
Plasma proteomic signature predicts who will get persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection

### Description
The majority of those infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave did not require hospitalisation. Most had a short-lived mild or asymptomatic infection, while others had symptoms that persisted for weeks or months. We performed a longitudinal targeted analysis of the plasma proteome of 156 healthcare workers (HCW) with and without lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that the plasma proteome would reflect differences in the inflammatory response that linked to symptom severity and duration. We showed that perturbation of the proteome persisted for over six weeks, tracking symptom severity and antibody responses. Additionally, we identified a prognostic signature at the time of seroconversion that identified individuals likely to suffer from persistent symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Sample Protocol
Study approvals. The COVIDsortium Healthcare Workers bioresource was approved by the UK Research Ethics Committee (South Central - Oxford A Research Ethics Committee, reference 20/SC/0149). The study conformed to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Participants were not compensated for participation.   Study design and population. We undertook a case control study nested within our COVIDsortium health care worker cohort. Participant screening, study design, sample collection, and sample processing have been described in detail previously6,50–52 and the study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04318314). Briefly, healthcare workers were recruited at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, UK in the first week of lockdown in the United Kingdom (between 23rd and 31st March 2020). Participants underwent weekly evaluation using a questionnaire and biological sample collection (including PCR and serological assays) for up to 16 weeks when fit to attend work at each visit, with further follow up symptom questionnaires collected at 6 and 12 months. Participants with available plasma samples who had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Roche cobas® diagnostic test platform) at any time point from week 0 to week 6 were included as ‘cases’. A subset of consecutively recruited participants at baseline without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on nasopharyngeal swabs and who remained seronegative by both Euroimmun antiS1 spike protein and Roche anti-nucleocapsid protein throughout follow-up were included as uninfected HCW.

### Data Protocol
Proteomic analysis. The proteomics panel selection was inspired by previous works23,28,53 and was designed to capture novel findings/biomarkers beyond those that could be found by highly used conventional inflammatory panels. We included proteins associated with acute phase proteins, apolipoproteins, complement factors, coagulation cascade components, interleukin signalling pathway members (especially of IL-6), and modulators of inflammation. In addition, there is an increasing body of evidence in support of SARS-CoV-2 related neurological and cognitive dysfunction. These are associated to changes in central nervous system structure54 and are postulated to occur secondary to either viral neurotropism or virally induced neuroinflammation9,55. Thus, approximatively 25% of our panel consists of neuroinflammatory biomarkers (Table S3). Whole blood collected from individual participants was centrifuged on-site. Aliquoted plasma samples were stored in a freezer at −80°C until use. Ten microlitres (10 μl) of plasma were analysed from each sample. As previously reported7 we developed a custom targeted MS based assay panel that looks at over 90 pro- and anti-inflammatory associated plasma proteins (see Table 1 on protocols.io56). Quantatypic peptides were selected based on previous proteomics data and from the online multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) database (www.thegpm.org). All MS analyses were performed using a Xevo- TQ XS  mass spectrometer coupled to a Acquity UPLC (LC) and quadrupole time of flight (QToF) Premier mass spectrometer (MS, Waters Corporation, Manchester, U.K.). Pooled plasma digest was used as a quality control (QC) which was run periodically between injections. QCs were monitored throughout the run and a coefficient of variation of +/- 15% was considered acceptable for run. A standard curve 0–40 pmol was run at the start and end of the run. Two transitions were selected for the assay; one for quantitation and one for confirmation. The most abundant clean transitions without interfering non-specific peaks were selected using the synthetic peptides spiked into matrix. Chromatograms were analyzed using SkyLine software (MacCoss labs, USA). Semi-automated peak integration was processed by manual inspection to correct for false assignments. The reader was fully blinded to the clinical status of HCW throughout the analysis procedure. Only peptides that gave good quantitative data by assessment using a standard curve spiked in plasma, and good signal to noise ratio of the endogenous peptide, were used in the assay. Integrated peak areas were expressed as a ratio to internal standard and subsequently z-score normalised across analytes..  A mean standard curve linearity of R2 0.96 ± 0.04 was achieved across the calibration curves for the assayed proteins. Mean coefficients of variation for target peptides between replicate quality control samples was 9.1 ± 3.3%.
