### Title
Amphibalanus amphitrite transcriptomics and proteomics - cement proteins

### Description
A complete understanding of barnacle adhesion remains elusive as the process occurs within and beneath the confines of a rigid calcified shell. Barnacle cement is mainly proteinaceous and several individual proteins have been identified in the hardened cement at the barnacle-substrate interface.We report the discovery of a novel 114kD cement protein, which is identified in material secreted onto various surfaces by adult barnacles and with the encoding gene highly expressed in the sub-mantle tissue.

### Sample Protocol
Barnacle protein secretions were collected on several surfaces and extracted by different solvents (SDS sample buffer, pentafluoroisopropanol,...), separated by PAGE, band isolated and digested in gel. Peptides were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Resulting spectra were searched against Amphibalanus Amphitrite database built in house (translated transcriptomic sequences in combination with previously published protein sequences from this barnacle species) by Mascot. Peptide and protein identifications were validated by Scaffold.
