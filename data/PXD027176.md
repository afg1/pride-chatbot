### Title
Peanut Root Waterlogging LC-MSMS

### Description
The project analyzed quantitative proteomics in two peanut cultivars under waterlogging stress, and identified differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) as well as protein-protein interactions (PPI) between two cultivars with different waterlogging tolerance.

### Sample Protocol
Root proteins were first extracted and quantified using the Bradford method, and then separated using SDS-PAGE. Trypsin digestion was then conducted to digest proteins. HPLC followed by LC-MS/MS under both DDA and DIA modes were performed to characterize protein components.

### Data Protocol
Database search was done by MaxQuant to process DDA data and then Spectronaut was used to construct a spectrum library. UniProt protein database was then used for CO, COG/KOG, and KEGG pathway annotations. MSstats was used to compare between different sample groups for DAPs and PPI was conducted using STRING database for functional classification of DAPs.
