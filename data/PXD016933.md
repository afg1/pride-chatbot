### Title
MALDI MS-MS analysis of Arachis hypogaea seed proteinase inhibitor

### Description
Plant Protease Inhibitors (PIs) plays an important role in defense and combat against insect pests and pathogens. In the present study, Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) was purified(���������8 kDa) from mature seeds of an interspecific advanced hybrid peanut variety (4368-1) using trypsin affinity and size exclusion chromatographic techniques. The one and two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis revealed the existence of purified protein as several isoinhibitors in higher ordered oligomers. However, all the resolved isoforms exhibited inhibitory activity against bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin which is observed under one and 2-D in-gel activity staining. One of the high intensity isoinhibitor spot (pI 5.9) from 2-D gel was subjected to MALDI TOF-TOF analysis. The MS-MS ionization of PMF peak 3313.817 m/z revealed the amino acid sequence ���������APPYFECVCVDTFDHCPASCNSCVCTR��������� showed identity with BBIs of Arachis hypogaea along with significant similarity with other legume BBIs, hence the purified protein from peanut is named as PnBBI. Also, other biochemical and biophysical characteristics of PnBBI such as low molecular mass, presence of several isoinhibitors and their oligomerization, predominance of antiparallel ������-sheets and random coils in secondary structure, reactive sites against trypsin and chymotrypsin, broad spectrum of stability towards extreme pH and temperature similar to the typical characteristics of BBIs. Surface plasmon resonance competitive binding analysis revealed the bifuncitonal PnBBI is a trypsin specific inhibitor with 1:2 stoiciometry compared to chymotrypsin. A concentration dependent self-assocition tendency of PnBBI was further confirmed by red shift in far-UV CD spectra. Furthermore, the insecticidal potential of PnBBI against Helicoverpa armigera was assessed by in vitro assays and in vivo feeding experiments. A significant reduction in  larval body weight was observed with concomitant attenuation in activity of midgut trypsin-like proteases of H. armigera (HaTPs) fed on PnBBI supplemented diet. The one and two-dimensional zymography studies revealed disappearence of several isoforms of HaTP upon feeding with PnBBI. qRT-PCR analysis further suggest the role of PnBBI in not only inhibiting the activity of midgut trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases but also in modulating their expression. Taken together, the results provide a biochemical and molecular basis for introgressed resistance in peanut interspecific advanced hybrid variety against H. armigera.

### Sample Protocol
Immobiline pH gradient dry strip (pH 4-7, 11 cm, L) was subjected to rehydration at 25 ������C overnight with 200 ������l of rehydration buffer containing 70 ������g of PnBBI under reducing (7.0 M urea, 2.0 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT and 1% IPG buffer) conditions. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed by using Ettan IPGPhor 3 system (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences, USA) according to the manufacturer���������s guidelines. IEF was carried out at a current setting of 50 ������A per strip and applied voltage as follows: 500 V-500 Vh; linear gradient to 1000 V-800 Vh; elevated gradient to 6000 V-8800 Vh and final focusing at 6000 V-4500 Vh. Following the first dimension, each strip was equilibrated for 20 min in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 30% glycerol and 2% SDS in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) with 50 mm DTT and 100 mM IDA under reducing conditions. The second dimension was carried out by 15% Tricine SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie brilliant blue staining. The isoinhibitor spot of PnBBI (pI 5.9) from the reduced 2-DE gel was excised and processed for MALDI MS/MS analysis as described in Shevchenko et al. (1996). Briefly, the gel plug was destained with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (ACN) mixed in 1:1 ratio. Gel plug was subjected to reduction at 56 ������C for 1 hour in the presence of 10 mM DTT followed by alkylation with 55 mM IDA for 45 min in dark. Further, gel piece was washed twice with destaining solution followed by acetonitrile before subjected to trypsin (1.25 ������g) digestion. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min followed by wetting with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37 ������C for 16 hours and the supernatant was collected by mild spinning for 1 min. The leftover peptides in the gel plug were extracted in 2-3 repeats by addition of 10 ������l of 0.5% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) in 50% ACN followed by water bath sonication and vortex at room temperature for 15 min. The concentrated peptide solution was mixed with matrix (CHCA, ������-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) solution in 1:1 (v/v) ratio and spotted on MALDI plate, and allowed it for air dry before proceeding to MS and MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The PMF and MS/MS data generated from MALDI TOF-TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Autoflex III smart beam) instrument was analysed using BioTools 3.1 software in MASCOT search database (Matrix Science) by uploading peak list .XML file. The search parameters were selected at zero allowed missed cleavages with fixed and variable modifications of carbamidomethyl (C) and Oxidation (M), respectively. The precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set as 1379.9 ppm and 1.2 Da, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
Proteinase/Protease inhibitors (PIs) from higher plants play an important role in defense and confer resistance against various insect pests and pathogens. In the present study, Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) was purified from mature seeds of an interspecific advanced hybrid peanut variety (4368-1) using chromatographic techniques. The biochemical and biophysical characteristics such as low molecular mass, presence of several isoinhibitors and higher-ordered dimer/tetramer, predominance of antiparallel &#x3b2;-sheets and random coils in secondary structure, reactive sites against trypsin and chymotrypsin, broad spectrum of stability toward extreme pH and temperature along with MALDI TOF-TOF analysis (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD016933) ascertained the purified biomolecule from peanut as BBI (PnBBI). Surface plasmon resonance competitive binding analysis revealed the bifunctional PnBBI is a trypsin specific inhibitor with 1:2 stoichiometry as compared to chymotrypsin. A concentration-dependent self-association tendency of PnBBI was further confirmed by 'red shift' in the far-UV CD spectra. Furthermore, the insecticidal potential of PnBBI against <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> was assessed by <i>in vitro</i> assays and <i>in vivo</i> feeding experiments. A significant reduction in larval body weight was observed with concomitant attenuation in the activity of midgut trypsin-like proteases of <i>H. armigera</i> (HaTPs) fed on PnBBI supplemented diet. The one and two-dimensional zymography studies revealed the disappearance of several isoforms of HaTP upon feeding with PnBBI. qRT-PCR analysis further suggests the role of PnBBI in not only inhibiting the activity of midgut trypsin and chymotrypsin-like proteases but also in modulating their expression. Taken together, the results provide a biochemical and molecular basis for introgressed resistance in peanut interspecific advanced hybrid variety against <i>H. armigera</i>.
