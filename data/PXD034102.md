### Title
Aberrant expression of transglutaminase 2 in pancreas and thymus of NOD mice underscores the importance of deamidation in neoantigen generation.

### Description
Post-translational modifications can lead to a break in immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Deamidation, the conversion of glutamine to glutamic acid by transglutaminase (TGM) enzymes, is a post-translational modification of interest, with deamidated peptides being reported as autoantigens in T1D. However, little is known about how Tgm2, the most ubiquitously expressed Tgm isoform, is regulated and how tolerance against deamidated peptides is lost. Here, we report on the aberrant expression and regulation of Tgm2, in the pancreas and thymus of NOD mice. We demonstrate that Tgm2 expression is induced by the inflammatory cytokines IL1β and IFNγ in a synergistic manner and that murine pancreatic islets of NOD mice have higher Tgm2 levels, while Tgm2 levels in thymic mTECs are reduced. We thus provide the first direct evidence to our knowledge that central tolerance establishment against deamidated peptides might be impaired due to lower Tgm2 expression in NOD mice, which together with the aberrantly high levels of deamidated peptides in NOD β-cells underscores the role of deamidation in amplifying T-cell reactivity.

### Sample Protocol
Murine islets were prepared for proteomics and run on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific), following our optimized protocol for accurate detection of deamidated peptides, including manual inspection of spectra, as previously described (PMID 33372785). Briefly, cell lysates were reduced, alkylated and quenched, followed by protein precipitation using the Wessel-Flügge method. Digestion was performed in ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 with modified trypsin (Pierce; protein/trypsin ratio 1:20 (w/w)) for 90 minutes at 37°C in the presence of 5% acetonitrile and 0.01% ProteaseMAX (Promega). Peptide mixtures were subjected to desalting with C18 ZipTip pipet tips (Millipore) and loaded on an Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Dionex, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified by Mascot (Matrix Science) using SwissProt as a database through Proteome Discoverer 2.2, incorporating Percolator for peptide validation. Two missed cleavages were allowed, peptide tolerance was set at 5 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance at 20 mmu. Carbamidomethylation (C) was included as a fixed modification and oxidation (M) and deamidation (N/Q) were included as variable modifications.

### Publication Abstract
Post-translational modifications can lead to a break in immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Deamidation, the conversion of glutamine to glutamic acid by transglutaminase (TGM) enzymes, is a post-translational modification of interest, with deamidated peptides being reported as autoantigens in T1D. However, little is known about how <i>Tgm2</i>, the most ubiquitously expressed <i>Tgm</i> isoform, is regulated and how tolerance against deamidated peptides is lost. Here, we report on the aberrant expression and regulation of <i>Tgm2</i> in the pancreas and thymus of NOD mice. We demonstrate that <i>Tgm2</i> expression is induced by the inflammatory cytokines IL1&#x3b2; and IFN&#x3b3; in a synergistic manner and that murine pancreatic islets of NOD mice have higher <i>Tgm2</i> levels, while <i>Tgm2</i> levels in medullary thymic epithelial cells are reduced. We thus provide the first direct evidence to our knowledge that central tolerance establishment against deamidated peptides might be impaired due to lower <i>Tgm2</i> expression in NOD medullary thymic epithelial cells, which together with the aberrantly high levels of deamidated peptides in NOD &#x3b2;-cells underscores the role of deamidation in amplifying T-cell reactivity.
