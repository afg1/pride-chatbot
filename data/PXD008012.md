### Title
In vivo phosphoproteomics reveals kinase activity profiles that predict treatment  outcome in triple-negative breast cancer

### Description
Triple-negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC) lacks  prognostic  and  predictive markers.  We  used  high-throughput  phosphoproteomics  to build  a functional TNBC taxonomy.  A  cluster of 159 phosphosites was upregulated in relapsed cases of a training set (n=34  patients).  Eleven  hyperactive  kinases  accounted  for  this  phosphoprofile. A  massspectrometry-to-immunohistochemistry  translation  step  that  assessed  113  TNBC  validation specimens revealed  that 6/12 kinases (PRKCE,  KIT,  PNKP,  ERK, CDK6, and P70S6K) preserved independent prognostic value. The kinases split the validation  set  into  two  patterns:  one  (0/6 hyperactive  kinases;  29%  of  the  patients)  associated  with  a  93.5%  cure  rate.  The  other   (â‰¥1  hyperactive  kinase;  37  subpatterns)  was  associated with  a  9.5-fold  higher relapse  risk.  Each  kinase  pattern  agglutinated  different  mutational  patterns.  Drug  regimens  designed  based  on  these  six  kinases  showed  synergistic  activity  in  vitro  and in  vivo.  Our  results  elucidated  novel  phosphosites/kinases  that  are  implicated  in  TNBC  and  provide  a  ready-to-use,  actionable target-based clinical classification system for TNBC

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted and digested with Lys-C/trypsin. Phosphopeptides were purified with Ti4+-IMAC micro-columns and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Elite

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed with MaxQuant 1.3.0.5 using the standard settings

### Publication Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks prognostic and predictive markers. Here, we use high-throughput phosphoproteomics to build a functional TNBC taxonomy. A cluster of 159 phosphosites is upregulated in relapsed cases of a training set (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34 patients), with 11 hyperactive kinases accounting for this phosphoprofile. A mass-spectrometry-to-immunohistochemistry translation step, assessing 2 independent validation sets, reveals 6 kinases with preserved independent prognostic value. The kinases split the validation set into two patterns: one without hyperactive kinases being associated with a &gt;90% relapse-free rate, and the other one showing &#x2265;1 hyperactive kinase and being associated with an up to 9.5-fold higher relapse risk. Each kinase pattern encompasses different mutational patterns, simplifying mutation-based taxonomy. Drug regimens designed based on these 6 kinases show promising antitumour activity in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In summary, the present study elucidates phosphosites and kinases implicated in TNBC and suggests a target-based clinical classification system for TNBC.
