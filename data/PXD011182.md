### Title
EPIC: Software Toolkit for Elution Profile-Based Inference of Protein Complexes

### Description
Heteromeric protein complexes are key macromolecular machines of the cell, but their description remains incomplete. We previously reported an experimental strategy for global characterization of native protein assemblies based on chromatographic fractionation of biological extracts coupled to precision mass spectrometry analysis (CF/MS), but the resulting data can be challenging to process and interpret. Here, we describe EPIC (Elution Profile-based Inference of Complexes), a software toolkit for automated scoring of CF/MS data for large-scale determination of high-confidence physical interaction networks and macromolecular assemblies from diverse biological specimens. As a case study, we used EPIC to map the global interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans, defining 590 putative worm protein complexes linked to diverse biological processes, including assemblies unique to nematodes. The EPIC software is freely available as a Jupyter notebook packaged in a Docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/baderlab/bio-epic/), and the open source code is available via GitHub (https://github.com/BaderLab/EPIC).

### Sample Protocol
1,380 IEX fractions generated for soluble worm proteins were extracted from mixed stage C. elegans cultures. Co-eluting proteins were acid-precipitated, alkylated and trypsin digested, and the resulting peptide mixtures analyzed by precision Orbitrap MS.

### Data Protocol
The samples were searched with three different search engines(comet, MSGF+ and X!Tandem) and the results probabilistically integrated results into MSblender(http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/MSblender), setting the false-discovery rate less than 1% for peptide spectral matching for each sample

### Publication Abstract
Protein complexes are key macromolecular machines of the cell, but their description remains incomplete. We and others previously reported an experimental strategy for global characterization of native protein assemblies based on chromatographic fractionation of biological extracts coupled to precision mass spectrometry analysis (chromatographic fractionation-mass spectrometry, CF-MS), but the resulting data are challenging to process and interpret. Here, we describe EPIC (elution profile-based inference of complexes), a software toolkit for automated scoring of large-scale CF-MS data to define high-confidence multi-component macromolecules from diverse biological specimens. As a case study, we used EPIC to map the global interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans, defining 612 putative worm protein complexes linked to diverse biological processes. These included novel subunits and assemblies unique to nematodes that we validated using orthogonal methods. The open source EPIC software is freely available as a Jupyter notebook packaged in a Docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/baderlab/bio-epic/).
