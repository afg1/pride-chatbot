### Title
Melanoma metastases: association between S100A13 expression and chemotherapy resistance

### Description
Here we have performed quantitative profiling of the proteome of lymph node metastasis from patients with melanoma with different response to chemotherapy.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were digested with trypsin, labeled with 8plex iTRAQ and separated by isoelectric focusing before LC-MS/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos.

### Data Protocol
MSMS data was searched using Mascot under Proteome Discoverer 1.1 against the human Uniref100 protein sequence database. Variable mods: oxidation of methionine. Fixed mods: carbamidomethylation of cysteine, iTRAQ8plex on N-terminus and on lysine side chains.
