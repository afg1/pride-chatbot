### Title
Rat heart proteomics in a spinal cord injury

### Description
The vascular functions of rat hearts were tested using shotgun proteomics in a model of spinal cord injury.

### Sample Protocol
Shotgun proteomics of rat hearts and peptides were labeled with light and heavy dimethylation.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using the MaxQuant software.
