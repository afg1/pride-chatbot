### Title
Sleep-wake cycles drive daily dynamics of synaptic phosphorylation

### Description
The circadian clock drives daily changes of physiology, including sleep-wake cycles, by regulating transcription, protein abundance and function. Circadian phosphorylation controls cellular processes in peripheral organs, but little is known about its role in brain function and synaptic activity. We applied advanced quantitative phosphoproteomics to mouse forebrain synaptoneurosomes isolated across 24h, accurately quantifying almost 8,000 phosphopeptides. Remarkably, half of the synaptic phosphoproteins, including numerous kinases, had large-amplitude rhythms peaking at rest-activity and activity-rest transitions. Bioinformatic analyses revealed global temporal control of synaptic function via phosphorylation, including synaptic transmission, cytoskeleton reorganization and excitatory/inhibitory balance. Remarkably, sleep deprivation abolished 98% of all phosphorylation cycles in synaptoneurosomes, indicating that sleep-wake cycles rather than circadian signals are main drivers of synaptic phosphorylation, responding to both sleep and wake pressures.

### Sample Protocol
Biochemically isolated synaptoneurosome lysates were processed using the EasyPhos platform. Detailed protocols are provided in the associated manuscript.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry RAW data were processed using MaxQuant and analysed using Perseus. Detailed settings are provided in the associated manuscript.
