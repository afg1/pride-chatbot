### Title
Populus trichocarpa TMT proteomics analyses

### Description
To understand the potential mechanisms underlying EBB1-mediated branching, proteomics analyses were used.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction, Trypsin digestion, Tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling, High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation, LC-MS/MS Analysis

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 4 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in First search and 5 ppm in Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification and acetylation modification and oxidation on Met were specified as variable modifications. FDR was adjusted to < 1% and minimum score for modified peptides was set > 40.
