### Title
Serpinb1 as a novel beta cell growth factor

### Description
Phosphoproteomic profiling of mouse islets treated with Serpinb1 at multiple time points

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, labeled with 6-plex TMT, enriched for phosphopeptides, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline

### Publication Abstract
Although compensatory islet hyperplasia in response to insulin resistance is a recognized feature in diabetes, the factor(s) that promote &#x3b2; cell proliferation have been elusive. We previously reported that the liver is a source for such factors in the liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, an insulin resistance model that manifests islet hyperplasia. Using proteomics we show that serpinB1, a protease inhibitor, which is abundant in the hepatocyte secretome and sera derived from LIRKO mice, is the liver-derived secretory protein that regulates &#x3b2; cell proliferation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Small-molecule compounds, that partially mimic serpinB1 effects of inhibiting elastase activity, enhanced proliferation of &#x3b2; cells, and mice lacking serpinB1 exhibit attenuated &#x3b2; cell compensation in response to insulin resistance. Finally, SerpinB1 treatment of islets modulated proteins in growth/survival pathways. Together, these data implicate serpinB1 as an endogenous protein that can potentially be harnessed to enhance functional &#x3b2; cell mass in patients with diabetes.
