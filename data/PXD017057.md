### Title
Decoding altitude ��� activated regulatory mechanisms underlining apple peel coloration and ripening

### Description
Apple (Malus domestica Borkh) is an important fruit crop cultivated in a broad range of environmental conditions. Apple fruit, and specifically peel tissue, ripening is a physiological process whose molecular regulatory networks response to different environments are still not sufficiently investigated. In this study, the influence of low (20 m) and high (750 m) altitude environmental conditions in peel tissue was assessed by physiological measurements combined with global metabolite and protein expression profiling during apple fruit development and ripening. Although apple fruit ripening was unaffected by the different environmental conditions, however several key color parameters, such as redness and the color percentage index, were induced by high altitude. Consistent with this, increased level of anthocyanin and other phenolic compounds, including cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and chlorogenic acid were identified in apple peel at high altitude. Also, high altitude environment, particularly, at the ripening period, up-accumulated various carbohydrates (eg., arabinose, xylose and sucrose) while repressed glutamic acid and several related proteins such as glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and glutamate���glyoxylate aminotransferase. Other processes affected by high altitude concerned the TCA cycle, the synthesis of oxidative/defense enzymes, and the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins. Finally, we constructed a metabolite-protein network depicting the impact of altitude on peel ripening. These data provide insights into physiological processes linked to apple peel ripening across different climatic conditions and will assist in efforts to improve apple fruit appeal and quality.

### Sample Protocol
Peel tissue samples at 140 and 160 DAFB from low- and high-altitude regions were processed as outlined before 45. The protein pellets comprising 3 biological plus 3 technical replicas of each conditions (140, 160 DAFB, low/high altitude) were resuspended in 8 M Urea/100���mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 (UA), and the extracted proteins were processed according to the Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) protocol using spin filter devices with a 10 kDa cut-off (Sartorius, VN01H02) 36. Proteins on the filters were extensively washed through centrifugation at 14000 g with the UA solution, reduced with 100 mM DTT in UA for 30 minutes and subsequently alkylated with 10���mg mL-1 iodoacetamide in the urea solution for 30���minutes in the dark. Proteins on the top of the filters were washed three times with 50���mM ammonium bicarbonate and finally digested in a thermomixer overnight at 37�����C and with 300 rpm by adding 1�����g trypsin/LysC mix in 80�����L of 50���mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (Mass spec grade, Promega). Peptides were eluted by centrifugation and dried down completely by speed-vac-assisted solvent removal. Dried peptides eluates were reconstituted in 0,1 % (v/v) formic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in water and subjected to 1-minute sonicating water bath. Peptide concentration was determined by nanodrop absorbance measurement at 280���nm.

### Data Protocol
The raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16) searching against the GDDH13_1-1_prot.fasta database (45.116 entries, downloaded at 02/10/2017 from the GDR). The search parameters covered a molecular weight ranging from 350 to 5.000 Da, with precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, MS/MS fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da, a maximum of two missed cleavages by trypsin, and methionine oxidation, deamination of glutamine, asparagine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed cysteine modification. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was performed in MaxQuant. The protein and peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1%. The match-between-run function was enabled. Statistical analyses and data visualization were performed using Perseus (version 1.6.0.2). Proteins that the identification results were ���potential contaminants���, ���reverse��� and ���only identified by site��� were filtered out. The LFQ intensities were transformed to logarithmic. Zero intensity was imputed i.e. replaced by normal distribution, assuming that the corresponding protein is present in low amounts in the sample. The three (3) biological replicas plus three (3) corresponding technical replicas were grouped for each treatment and a two-sided Welch���s T-test of the grouped proteins was performed using p value (<0.01) for truncation (Supplementary Table 3). Protein annotations were added from the text file downloaded from GDR site (Dated 02/10/2017). A detailed list of the proteins identified and quantified (as z-scores) as well as their available GDR annotations such as KEGG orthologs, interPro domains, GO, is provided in Supplementary Table 3. Moreover, an enrichment analysis based on GO terms, KEGG pathways as well as the functional classification of the statistically significant regulated proteins was conducted (Supplementary Table 3). The approach used, was the statistical Fisher exact test and the p value threshold was set to <0.02.
