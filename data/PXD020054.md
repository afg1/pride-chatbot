### Title
Identification of CEBPA and RUNX1 interactors in 3q-rearranged AML (HNT-34)

### Description
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with specific isolation of chromatin associated proteins (ChIP-SICAP) was used to identify chromatin-bound interactors of CEBPA and RUNX1 in the 3q-rearranged human myeloid leukemia cell line HNT-34.

### Sample Protocol
Fixed and sheared chromatin was incubated with antibodies against CEBPA (D56F10, Cell Signaling), RUNX1 (ab23980, Abcam) or an IgG control (#2729S, Cell Signaling). DNA bound to the immunoprecipitated complexes was biotinylated, proteins bound to the biotinylated DNA were purified with streptavidin beads, digested with LysC and analyzed with mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant version 1.5.3.30 (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) including the Andromeda search engine.6,7 Peptides were identified using the Uniprot Homo sapiens database concatenated to a database containing protein sequences of contaminants. Default MaxQuant parameters were used with the following modifications: digestion with LysC, default variable modification (methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation), cytosine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, and minimum peptide length 5. FDR was set to 1% at both protein and peptide level. Match between runs option was enabled, Label Free Quantification (LFQ) and iBAQ calculated.
