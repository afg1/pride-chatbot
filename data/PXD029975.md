### Title
Protective effects of breviscapine on HFHC diet-induced C57 mice

### Description
The phosphorylomics data of liver tissue of 16-week-old HFHC-induced mice treated with saline or breviscapine for 8 weeks. The mice fed with high fat and high cholesterol were also divided into two groups. The control group was treated with normal saline for 8W, and the drug group was treated with breviscapine for 8W n=3.

### Sample Protocol
Healthy 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were housed in cages under standard laboratory conditions (22–24°C temperature, 55–60% relative humidity and 12 h light/dark cycle). A mouse model of NASH was established by feeding the mice a HFHC (protein, 14%; fat, 42%; carbohydrates, 44%; cholesterol, 2%; IMA2019001; TrophicDiet, Nantong, China) diet for 16 weeks, and breviscapine (15 and 30 mg/kg)(190620, Shanghai Winherb Medical Science Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was administered daily by oral gavage after 8 weeks.

### Data Protocol
Phosphorylated polypeptides from cell or tissue lysates were enriched with TiO2 magnetic beads and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a Proxeon Easy-NLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific, Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The abundance of phosphorylated peptides in the control group and the treatment group was quantified using an unlabeled quantitative method, and the difference in the abundance of phosphorylated peptide fractions between the control group and the treatment group was tested for significance by t-test. The screening criterion for differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins was a P value less than 0.05.
