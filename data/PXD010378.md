### Title
Screening protein predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors treatment in rheumatoid arthritis by using iTRAQ technique and investigating its mechanism through signal pathway

### Description
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and disabling disease. TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated an outstanding performance in relieving joint inflammation and retarding bone erosion involved in RA. However, there is still about one-thirds of RA patients had a poor response to TNF α inhibitors. Currently the personalized biological treatment is the research hotspot. Recent studies focuses on exploring biomarkers predictive of drug response. The research methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and immunocytology, have been applied, but they are not successfully integrated. The related studies in China are still at an initial stage, which necessitates an in-depth study in this area. Our preliminary study showed that TNF-α-308 gene polymorphisms existed in Chinese RA patients and PI3K/Akt signal pathway was ativated in proliferated synovial fibroblasts stimulated by TNF-α. Therefore, for the first attempt in China, we intend to screen for differential proteins by using iTRAQ technique in RA patients receiving anti-TNF-α therapy, and then verify the predictive effects of selected differential proteins from the upstream gene polymorphism to the downstream protein expression. We will also investigate the mechanisms of differential proteins involved in TNF-α related signal pathway by using in vitro gene transfer, siRNA interference, and RA animal models. Through our study we hope to discover a prediction protein with a domestic genetic background and finally establish a prediction system with Chinese characteristics.

### Sample Protocol
Before initial administration of IFX+MTX+LEF, in addition to routine laboratory tests, 10 ml whole blood were obtained from fasting patients or healthy controls at nine o'clock in the morning with separator tubes ,then they were kept at 4 °C for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 3000 g for 3 min. The plasma supernatant was distributed into 1.8ml aliquots and stored at - 80 °C until used in latent iTRAQ study. A retrospective review of routinely recorded clinical data was undertaken.

### Data Protocol
iTRAQ :MS/MS spectra were searched using MASCOT engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.2) embedded into Proteome Discoverer 1.4 ( (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) and the paragon algorithm by comparison with the uniprot_human_156639_20170105.fasta.  http://www.uniprot.org . Accessed 5 January 2017.Proteins having at least one peptide above the 95% confidence level were recorded. Paragon method parameters including peptide labeled with iTRAQ 8plex, fixed modification of Carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ8plex (N-term), iTRAQ 8plex (K), iTRAQ8plex (N-term), iTRAQ 8plex (K) , Peptide Mass Tolerance were ± 20 ppm, Fragment Mass Tolerance is 0.1Da.The protein ratios are calculated as the median of only unique peptides of the protein, Normalizes all peptide ratios by the median protein ratio, the median protein ratio should be 1 after the normalization , all peptide ratios were normalizes by the median protein ratio. Bioinformatics analysis, including hierarchical cluster, gene ontology, pathway, and network, was performed using Blast2GO (Version 3.5.0), the online Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) and the In Act molecular interaction database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/). Statistical significance between R and NR was analyzed using Significance A and Fisher’s Exact Test , threshold for significance was set at P < 0.05, fold change method (± 1.2fold). This comparative analysis was based on the P values of the NR/R contrast inside each experiment to retain the low technical variability of iTRAQ. For these analyses, the likely contaminants from sample processing as trypsin, keratins or latex proteins were excluded, as well as, uncharacterized proteins.  PRM:Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS Statistics v.22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Predictors of treatment response were identified. (ANNOVA,T-test was used to compare between groups, comparison within the group. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression analyses were used to assess predictors of treatment response. All data are shown as the mean ± SD. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Comparisons among multiple groups were performed via ANOVA analysis. ROC(receiver operating characteristic curve) were utilized to assess the predictive value of the Candidate biological markers.
