### Title
Quantitative analysis of design substrates

### Description
Proteases are crucial physiologic regulators of protein structure and function. While proteomic methods contributed extensively to protease characterization efforts, technical challenges remain in terms of throughput, scalability and large datasets of protease cleavages remain scarce. Here, we describe a high-throughput protease screen (HTPS) which allows simultaneous characterization of multiple proteases under various conditions on a microscale 96FASP format. After benchmarking the performance with Trypsin, LysC, GluC, AspN, Chymotrypsin, MMP-2 and MMP-3, we applied it to profile proteases of the blood coagulation cascade (Factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, Thrombin α, β and γ, Plasmin and Protein C). The large dataset enabled us to map activity, specificity, cleave entropy, allosteric changes of blood cascade proteases induced by Na+ and to predict potential substrates in a data-driven way. Here, we designed two octapeptides, GIPRAAGD (α Thrombin) and GIGRRIAE (Factor Xa), and evaluated their cleavage with the target proteases.

### Sample Protocol
The octapeptides GIPRAAGD (α Thrombin) and GIGRRIAE (Factor Xa) were incubated 10 µM of the peptide with with 10 nM final concentration of proteases from 0 – 240 minutes. The cleavage products were analyzed on a reverse phase column (75 µm x 15 cm, packed with Magic C18 3 µm resin) with a 5 – 35 % 20 minute linear ACN/water gradient in 0.1% formic acid with a flow rate set to 300 nl/ml on a Proxeon EASY‐nLC II chromatography system and acquired in the Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fischer Scientific) in positive mode at 2.0 kV, the mass range of 150 to 1200 m/z, profile mode, resolution of 60.000 at 400 m/z. The measurement was performed using 1 µg of the standardized sample spiked with iRT peptides (Biognosys AG) at 1:20 and proteolyzed BSA at 0.1mg/ml as carrier.

### Data Protocol
We manually integrated the precursor isotope peaks (M, M+1, M+2) of GIPRAAGD (378.71 m/z), GIPR (221.64 m/z), AAGD (333.14 m/z) for α Thrombin and GIGRRIAE (436.26 m/z), GIGR (201.63 m/z), RIAE (488.28 m/z) for Factor Xa with Skyline software to monitor the respective reporter signals in a time-resolved fashion
