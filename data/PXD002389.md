### Title
IPG Strip-Based Peptide Fractionation for Shotgun Proteomics

### Description
This deep proteome dataset of human HEK293 cells was generated using IPG Strip-Based fractionation.

### Sample Protocol
The detailed sample processing is described in Murat et. al 2014; Methods in Molecular Biology. Briefly, extracted proteins from HEK293 cells were digested using Trypsin. Peptides were fractionized into 100 fraction using IPG Strip-Based fractionation. Peptide fractions were separated and identified on a reverse phase nLC coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.4.1.2. Standard settings were applied with Protein FDR set to 1, for identifiying evidences of predicted micropeptides.

### Publication Abstract
Efficient fractionation of peptides is an essential prerequisite for comprehensive analysis of complex protein mixtures by shotgun mass spectrometry. The separation of peptides by isoelectric focusing is particularly attractive due to its orthogonality to reverse-phase HPLC. Here, we present a protocol for in-gel peptide isoelectric focusing using immobilized pH gradient strips. The method shows high resolving power for up to 1 mg of sample and is highly reproducible.
