### Title
Proteomic analysis of Monkeypox virus produced with experimentally infected Vero E6 cells.

### Description
Proteomic analysis of Monkeypox virus produced with experimentally infected Vero E6 cells using Data-Dependent Detection for a comprehensive coverage. The analysis was performed to prioritize the most responsive peptides amenable to mass spectrometry for the development of mass spectrometry-based detection methods.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted and captured on SP3 beads, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed with an Exploris 480 tandem mass spectrometer coupled to a Vanquish Neo UHPLC system.

### Data Protocol
DDA MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT against a Chlorocebus/Monkeypox virus database using the follow-up mode and preliminary screen of a cRAP contaminant database. The results were then parsed. Spectral counts and NSAF were extracted and compared. MS/MS spectra were also analyzed by Maxquant to obtain LFQ values.
