### Title
MEK inhibition enhances presentation of targetable MHC-I tumor antigens in mutant melanomas - targeted data

### Description
Combining multiple therapeutic strategies in NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma – namely MEK/BRAF kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted immunotherapies – may offer an improved survival benefit by overcoming limitations associated with any individual therapy. Still, optimal combination, order, and timing of administration remains under investigation. Here, we measure how MEK inhibition alters anti-tumor immunity by utilizing quantitative immunopeptidomics to profile changes the peptide MHC (pMHC) repertoire. These data reveal a collection of tumor antigens whose presentation levels are selectively augmented following therapy, including several epitopes present at over 1000 copies-per-cell. We leveraged the tunable abundance of MEKi-modulated antigens by targeting 4 epitopes with pMHC-specific T cell engagers and antibody drug conjugates, enhancing cell killing in tumor cells following MEK inhibition. These results highlight drug treatment as a means to enhance immunotherapy efficacy by targeting specific upregulated pMHCs and provide a methodological framework for identifying, quantifying, and therapeutically targeting additional epitopes of interest.

### Sample Protocol
Peptide MHCs were purified by immunoprecipitation, acid elution, and molecular weight cut-off filtration and analyzed with targeted and discovery mass spectrometry. Additional details can be found in the associated manuscript.

### Data Protocol
Targeted analyses were analyzed using Skyline. Additional details can be found in the associated manuscript.

### Publication Abstract
Combining multiple therapeutic strategies in NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma-namely MEK/BRAF kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and targeted immunotherapies-may offer an improved survival benefit by overcoming limitations associated with any individual therapy. Still, optimal combination, order, and timing of administration remains under investigation. Here, we measure how MEK inhibition (MEKi) alters anti-tumor immunity by utilizing quantitative immunopeptidomics to profile changes in the peptide major histocompatibility molecules (pMHC) repertoire. These data reveal a collection of tumor antigens whose presentation levels are selectively augmented following therapy, including several epitopes present at over 1,000 copies per cell. We leveraged the tunable abundance of MEKi-modulated antigens by targeting four epitopes with pMHC-specific T cell engagers and antibody drug conjugates, enhancing cell killing in tumor cells following MEK inhibition. These results highlight drug treatment as a means to enhance immunotherapy efficacy by targeting specific upregulated pMHCs and provide a methodological framework for identifying, quantifying, and therapeutically targeting additional epitopes of interest.
