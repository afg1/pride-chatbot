### Title
Functional Classification of DDOST Variants of Uncertain Clinical Significance in Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation

### Description
identification of OST48 as a transient inetactor of lysyl oxidase (LOX)OST48 is a non catalytic component of the OST complex which transfers glycans to substrate proteins. OST48 is encoded by DDOST.43 cariants of DDOST are described in CDG patients

### Sample Protocol
APEX 2 proximity assay follwed by trypsin autolysis

### Data Protocol
XiC label free quantitation using Progeneis LCMS generating quantitiave information and an mascot generic file for searching Db  1 missed cleavage trypsin oxidation of M, deamidation NQ
