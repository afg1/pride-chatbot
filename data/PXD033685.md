### Title
MHC-I peptidome analysis of human cancer cell lines

### Description
In this study, we sought to identify naturally presented MHC peptides in 3 human cancer cell lines: A431, Colo668, HuCCT1. Peptides identified were 8-15 amino acid long with the majority between 8 to 11 amino acids which match known properties of MHC-I presented peptides.

### Sample Protocol
The mass spectrometry was done by contract by Caprion (Toronto, Canada). A431, Colo668, HuCCT1 cell lines were cultured and dissociated using cell dissociation buffer (ThermoFisher 13151014).  pMHC complexes were purified from ~300-500 million cells of each cell line by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti-MHC-I antibody W6/32 from cell lysates.  pMHC complexes were disrupted with mild acid.  The presented peptides were desalted with a mixed cation exchange matrix (MCX) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a single injection using nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography (NanoAcquity UPLC, Waters) coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Elucidator software (Rosetta), Mascot software (Matrix Science) and PEAKS software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) to determine peptide sequences and relative quantity in each sample.
