### Title
Meiotic DNA breaks activate a streamlined response that largely avoids protein level changes -DIA

### Description
To understand the proteome and phosphoproteome level responses to meiotic DNA breaks, we have compared protein phosphorylation and protein levels in cells spo11-YF (cannot form meiotic DNA breaks) cells to SPO11 (can form meiotic breaks) cells.

### Sample Protocol
We extracted proteins from meiotic samples using 8M Urea lysis buffer(8M urea, 50mM Tris-HCl, 75mM NaCl, 1x Calbiochem protease inhibitor, 1mM PMSF, 1x Thermo Fisher halt phosphatase and protease inhibitor). Samples were reduced using DTT(5mM) and alkylated with iodoacetamide(15mM). Then, we digested proteins with Trypsin(Trypsin Gold, Promega) overnight at 37C. We cleaned the samples using HyperSep(ThermoFisher) tips. For phosphoproteome samples, phosphopeptides were enriched using High-Select TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment(ThermoFisher) kit according to the manufacturer`s instructions.

### Data Protocol
Spectral data was collected in data independent acquisition mode with windows of variable sizes. RAW files was analyzed using Spectronaut (v 13.8.190930.43655) against a project-specific spectral library (produced using the phospho-DDA data submitted as the â€“DDA part of this project) in peptide centric mode and precursor q-value cutoff of 0.01. 20190910_140758_phospho_pph3_Report.xls file was processed with Perseus plug-in Peptide Collapse (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2020) to the map phosphorylation events with > 0.9 localization probability.
