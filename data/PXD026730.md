### Title
Global profiling of phosphorylation-dependent changes in cysteine reactivity

### Description
Proteomics has revealed that the ~20,000 human genes engender a far greater number of proteins, or proteoforms, that are diversified in large part by post-translational modifications (PTMs). How such PTMs affect protein structure and function is an active area of research but remains technically challenging to assess on a proteome-wide scale. Here, we describe a chemical proteomic method to quantitatively relate serine/threonine phosphorylation to changes in the reactivity of cysteine residues, a parameter that can affect the potential for cysteines to be post-translationally modified or engaged by covalent drugs. Leveraging the extensive high-stoichiometry phosphorylation occurring in mitotic cells, we discover numerous cysteines that exhibit phosphorylation-dependent changes in reactivity on diverse proteins enriched in cell cycle regulatory pathways. The discovery of bidirectional changes in cysteine reactivity often occurring in proximity to serine/threonine phosphorylation events points to the broad impact of phosphorylation on the chemical reactivity of proteins and the future potential to create small-molecule probes that differentially target PTM-modified proteoforms.

If the census-out file has *_phospho_* in the file name, raw files were searched with differential modifications against probe-labeled cysteines AND phosphorylation serines/threonines (up to 2x modifications)  Samples processed as described in Proteomic platforms: Asynchronous vs. Mitosis gel filtration isoTOP-ABPP (isoTOP-ABPP, related to Extended Data Figures 1, 2)  Mitosis:  180830_Exp268_C*, 180831_Exp269_C* 180902_Exp269_A* 180902_Exp269_B*, 181006_Exp278_C*, 181007_Exp278_D* Asynch: 181006_Exp276_A*, 181027_Exp288_A*, 181028_Exp288_B*, 181007_Exp276_B*

### Data Protocol
All data were searched against UniProt human database (2016-07 release).  TMT: RAW files were convereted to MS1/MS3/MS3 files using Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) and searched using ProLuCID.  isoTOP: RAW files were converted to MS1/MS2 files using Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) and searched using ProLuCID.   All downstream processing are described in methods section and available on GitHub.
