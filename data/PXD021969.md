### Title
Protein kinase A phosphorylation of perilipin 5 on serine 155 regulates liver lipolysis via interactions with adipose triglyceride lipase

### Description
Perilipin (PLIN) 5 is a lipid droplet-associated protein that coordinates intracellular lipolysis in highly oxidative tissues and is thought to regulate lipid metabolism in response to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). We detected phosphorylation on S155, S161 and S163 of recombinant PLIN5 by PKA in vitro and identified S155 as a functionally important site for lipid metabolism. Expression of phosphorylation defective PLIN5 S155A in Plin5 null cells resulted in decreased rates of lipolysis and triglyceride-derived fatty acid oxidation compared with cells expressing wildtype PLIN5. These differences in lipid metabolism were not associated with differences in the cellular distribution of PLIN5. Rather, FLIM-FRET analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that PLIN5 S155 phosphorylation regulates PLIN5 interaction with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) at the lipid droplet, but not with the co-activator of ATGL, a-b hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5). Re-expression of PLIN5 S155A in the liver of Plin5 liver-specific null mice reduced lipolysis when compared to mice with wildtype PLIN5 re-expression, but this was not associated with changes in other parameters of hepatic lipid metabolism. Furthermore, glycemic control was impaired in mice with expression of PLIN5 S155A when compared with mice expressing PLIN5. Together, these studies demonstrate that PLIN5 S155 is required for PKA-mediated lipolysis and builds on the body of evidence demonstrating a critical role for PLIN5 in coordinating lipid and glucose metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were excised from a SDS-PAGE, reduced with TCEP-HCl (Thermo Scientific), carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma) and digested with trypsin (Sigma). The tryptic peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile (acidified with 1% formic acid), lyophilized in a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 15 Âµl buffer A (0.1% formic acid). Prior to mass spectrometry, the peptides were further purified and enriched using OMIX C18 Mini-Bed tips (Agilent Technologies).

### Data Protocol
To obtain peptide and phosphopeptide sequence information, the raw files were searched with Andromeda implemented in MaxQuant v1.6.3.4 (Cox et al., 2008) against a focused database containing only Q8BVZ1 (Plin5) and P05132 (Prkaca) in addition to common contaminants. Carbamidomethylation at cysteine residues was specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation at methionine residues, N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation at serine, threonine or tyrosine residues were set as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was selected as protease and up to three missed cleavages were permitted. Precursor mass tolerances were set to 20 ppm and 4.5 ppm on the first and main search, respectively, whilst fragment ions were searched with a 20 ppm mass tolerance. Only peptides identified within a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% based on a decoy database were further analyzed.

### Publication Abstract
Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a lipid-droplet-associated protein that coordinates intracellular lipolysis in highly oxidative tissues and is thought to regulate lipid metabolism in response to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). We sought to identify PKA phosphorylation sites in PLIN5 and assess their functional relevance in cultured cells and the livers of mice. We detected phosphorylation on S155 and identified S155 as a functionally important site for lipid metabolism. Expression of phosphorylation-defective PLIN5 S155A in Plin5 null cells resulted in decreased rates of lipolysis and triglyceride-derived fatty acid oxidation. FLIM-FRET analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that PLIN5 S155 phosphorylation regulates PLIN5 interaction with adipose triglyceride lipase at the lipid droplet, but not with &#x3b1;-&#x3b2; hydrolase domain-containing 5. Re-expression of PLIN5 S155A in the liver of Plin5 liver-specific null mice reduced lipolysis compared with wild-type PLIN5 re-expression, but was not associated with other changes in hepatic lipid metabolism. Furthermore, glycemic control was impaired in mice with expression of PLIN5 S155A compared with mice expressing PLIN5. Together, these studies&#xa0;demonstrate that PLIN5 S155 is required for PKA-mediated lipolysis and builds on the body of evidence demonstrating a critical role for PLIN5 in coordinating lipid and glucose metabolism.
