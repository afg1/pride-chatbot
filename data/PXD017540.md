### Title
Staphylococcus aureus-induced proteomic changes in the mammary tissue of rats: A TMT study

### Description
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens causing mastitis in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to establish a rat mastitis model induced by a S.aureus infection and to explore proteins that change in proteomes of mammary tissue in different udders states,which provided a better understanding of the host immune response to S. aureus mastitis. Six 72 h postpartum rats were randomly divided into two groups (n=3), with either 100 µL of PBS (blank group) or a S. aureus suspension containing 2×107 CFU·ml−1 (challenge group) infused into the mammary gland duct,respectively. After 24 h of infection, the rats were sacrificed, and mammary gland tissue was collected. A tandem mass tag (TMT)-based technology was applied to compare the proteomes of healthy and mastitic mammary tissue. Compared with the control group, the challenge group had 555 proteins with significant differences in expression, of which 428 were significantly up-regulated (FC>1.2 and p<0.05) and 127 were down-regulated (FC>0.83 and p<0.05 or p<0.01). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that up-regulated differentially significant expressed proteins (DSEPs) were associated with mainly immune responses,including integrin alpha M,inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4,alpha-2-macroglobulin.

### Sample Protocol
All samples were taken and weighed, and 0.2 g was ground into powder in an ice bath. An appropriate amount of protein lysis buffer (8 M urea+1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, containing protease inhibitor) was added to lyse the samples on ice for 30 min, with vortex mixing for 5-10 s every 5 min. Ultrasonic pulses were applied on ice for 2 min, and after centrifugation at 12,000 ×g at 4℃ for 30 min, the supernatant was obtained. According to the operation method of the Thermo Scientific Pierce BCA kit, a standard protein solution with concentrations of 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2 ug·uL-1 and BCA working solution were prepared. Taken 2 µL of the sample, 18 µL of distilled water and 200 µL of the BCA working solution were added. Oscillatory mixing was used, and the samples were reacted at 37 ℃ for 30 min. The absorbance at 562 nm was read with a SPECTRA MAX microplate reader. Then, SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining were used to compare the consistency of protein expression in the samples. Taken 100 µg of protein sample, lysis solution was added to supplement the volume to 100 µL, and triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer was added at a final concentration of 100 mM. Then, 10 mM reducing agent (Bond-Breaker™ TCEP solution) was added, and the reaction time was 60 min at 37℃. Next, 40 mM iodoacetamide was added and reacted at room temperature for 40 min in darkness. Precooled acetone (W:V = 1:6) was added and precipitated at -20℃ for 4 h and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min, and the precipitation was transferred. The sample was fully dissolved with 100 µL of 50 mM TEAB. Enzymatic hydrolysis proceeded overnight at 37°C by added trypsin according to the mass ratio (enzyme:protein=1:50). TMT reagent was centrifuged, and after added acetonitrile and vortex mixing, a tube of TMT reagent was added to each 100 µg of polypeptide.  After incubation for 2 h, hydroxylamine was added and reacted at room temperature for 15 min. Equivalent labeled products were mixed in a tube and dried by vacuum concentrator. he peptide samples were redissolved in ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) buffer solution, and a reversed-phase C18 column (2.1 mm×150 mm, 1.7 µm-C18) was used to separate the components in a high-pH liquid phase. The second dimension used a nanoliter volume flow high-performance liquid chromatographer (HPLC) liquid phase system (EASY-nLC 1200) for separation at a 300 µL/min velocity for 120 min. Peptide segments were dissolved in mass spectrometry sample buffer and prepared in buffer solution (A: 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; B: 80% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid).

### Data Protocol
The raw files were submitted to the Proteome Manufacturer (Proteome DiscovererTM Software 2.2) server, the database that has been established was selected, and then a database search was performed.

### Publication Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens causing mastitis in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to establish a rat model of mastitis induced by S. aureus infection and to explore changes in the proteomes of mammary tissue in different udder states, providing a better understanding of the host immune response to S. aureus mastitis. On day 3 post-partum, 6 rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 3), with either 100 &#x3bc;L of PBS (blank group) or a S. aureus suspension containing 2&#xd7;107 CFU&#xb7;mL-1 (challenge group) infused into the mammary gland duct. After 24 h of infection, the rats were sacrificed, and mammary gland tissue was collected. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based technology was applied to compare the proteomes of healthy and mastitic mammary tissues. Compared with the control group, the challenge group had 555 proteins with significant differences in expression, of which 428 were significantly upregulated (FC&gt;1.2 and p&lt;0.05) and 127 were downregulated (FC&gt;0.83 and p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that upregulated differentially significant expressed proteins (DSEPs) were associated with mainly immune responses, including integrin alpha M, inter-&#x3b1;-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4, and alpha-2-macroglobulin. This study is the first in which a rat model of S. aureus-induced mastitis was used to explore the proteins related to mastitis in dairy cows by TMT technology, providing a model for replication of dairy cow S. aureus-induced mastitis experiments.
