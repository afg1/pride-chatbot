### Title
A scalable multiplexed platform to accelerate protein interactome discovery

### Description
Chromatographic fractionation-mass spectrometry (CF-MS) allows for mapping native protein-protein interactions and macromolecular complexes on a proteome-scale but is tedious and resource intensive for comparative analysis. Here, we present a more parsimonious and reproducible multiplexing CF-MS platform for measuring multi-protein assemblies across different experimental samples simultaneously with an order-of-magnitude faster than previous approaches. We used this innovative strategy to elucidate protein networks in control and breast cancer cells models in parallel within two weeks of total MS instrument time.

### Sample Protocol
Cell Lyis by homogenization, biochemical fractionation by ion-exchange chromatography, on-beads desalting and digestion, 6-plex TMT labeling of cofractionated protein digests, nanoflowLC-MS/MS analysis of labeled peptides.

### Data Protocol
The raw data were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.1.0). All spectra were searched using the Andromeda search engine against the Homo sapiens proteome FASTA file (dated January 2021; 20,294 entries) downloaded from UniprotKB.

### Publication Abstract
Co-fractionation/mass spectrometry (CF/MS) enables the mapping of endogenous macromolecular networks on a proteome scale, but current methods are experimentally laborious, resource intensive and afford lesser quantitative accuracy. Here, we present a technically efficient, cost-effective and reproducible multiplex CF/MS (mCF/MS) platform for measuring and comparing, simultaneously, multi-protein assemblies across different experimental samples at a rate that is up to an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We apply mCF/MS to map the protein interaction landscape of non-transformed mammary epithelia versus breast cancer cells in parallel, revealing large-scale differences in protein-protein interactions and the relative abundance of associated macromolecules connected with cancer-related pathways and altered cellular processes. The integration of multiplexing capability within an optimized workflow renders mCF/MS as a powerful tool for systematically exploring physical interaction networks in a comparative manner.
