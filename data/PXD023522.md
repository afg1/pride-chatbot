### Publication Abstract
Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry has become a popular tool in structural biology. Although several algorithms exist that efficiently analyze data-dependent mass spectrometric data, the algorithm to identify and quantify intermolecular cross-links located at the interaction interface of homodimer molecules was missing. The algorithm in LinX utilizes high mass accuracy for ion identification. In contrast with standard data-dependent analysis, LinX enables the elucidation of cross-linked peptides originating from the interaction interface of homodimers labeled by <sup>14</sup>N/<sup>15</sup>N, including their ratio or cross-links from protein-nucleic acid complexes. The software is written in Java language, and its source code and a detailed user's guide are freely available at https://github.com/KukackaZ/LinX or https://ms-utils.org/LinX. Data are accessible via the ProteomeXchange server with the data set identifier PXD023522.
