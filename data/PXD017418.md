### Title
Danio rerio thermal proteome profiling with pervanadate as drug of interest

### Description
In this study we performed thermal proteome profiling experiments on zebrafish lysate after treatment with the drug pervanadate.

### Sample Protocol
Zebrafish lysate was subjected to thermal proteome profiling, after which it was digested, TMT labelled followed by high pH fractionation. Samples were measured on an Q exactive HF-X.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0) with the following parameters: digestion by trypsin/P with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. As fixed modification carbamidomethylation of cysteine was chosen, as variable modification oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were chosen. TMT 10plex labelling was chosen as MS2 reporter ions. The mass tolerance of precursor ions was chosen as ±5 ppm and the mass tolerance of MS/MS was chosen as ±20 ppm. Results were adjusted to 1% PSM and 1% FDR using a target-decoy approach using reverted protein sequences
