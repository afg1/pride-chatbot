### Title
Interaction of iron oxide nanoparticles with human plasma

### Description
The Interaction of iron oxide nanoparticles with human plasma was studied.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE; The lanes were cut into sections and processed by reduction, alkylation and digestion by trypsin-LysC. The peptides were extracted and analysed by LC-MS/MS (nanoAcquity, LTQ velos).

### Data Protocol
A target-decoy search was performed with comet against a Uniprot fasta database for Homo sapiens. The hits were validated by PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet. The complete bioinformatic workflow was implemented in taverna running on massypup64.
