### Title
Yeast Proteomics

### Description
Proteomic study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum

### Sample Protocol
standard protocols used for proteomic analyses in yeast, coupled to size-exclusion chromatography of protein complexes

### Data Protocol
obtained data were searched in MaxQuant version 1.6.0.1 and the outputs were analyzed with in-lab developed software named PrInCE

### Publication Abstract
Hybrids between species often show extreme phenotypes, including some that take place at the molecular level. In this study, we investigated the phenotypes of an interspecies diploid hybrid in terms of protein-protein interactions inferred from protein correlation profiling. We used two yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces&#xa0;uvarum, which are interfertile, but yet have proteins diverged enough to be differentiated using mass spectrometry. Most of the protein-protein interactions are similar between hybrid and parents, and are consistent with the assembly of chimeric complexes, which we validated using an orthogonal approach for the prefoldin complex. We also identified instances of altered protein-protein interactions in the hybrid, for instance, in complexes related to proteostasis and in mitochondrial protein complexes. Overall, this study uncovers the likely frequent occurrence of chimeric protein complexes with few exceptions, which may result from incompatibilities or imbalances between the parental proteomes.
