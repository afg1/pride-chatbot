### Title
A proteomic approach for unravelling the relevance of the polyadenylation factor EhCFIm25 in Entamoeba histolytica survival and virulence

### Description
Please provide an overall description of your study, think something similar in scope to the manuscript abstractCFIm25 is essential for recruitment of other polyadenylation factors, poly(A) site selection, pre-mRNA cleavage and poly(A) tail synthesis. We recently reported that EhCFIm25 silencing in Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan responsible for amebic dysentery, affects trophozoite proliferation and death, and reduces parasite virulence, indicating its relevance as a new biochemical target in this human pathogen. Here, we performed a shotgun proteomic analysis to evidence the impact of EhCFIm25 silencing on protein expression that can explain the observed phenotype

### Sample Protocol
the volume corresponding to 150 μg total proteins obtained from the three culture conditions was delivered to the Laboratorio Nacional de Servicios Experimentales (LaNSE), CINVESTAV (Mexico), for protein identification and absolute quantitation by mass spectrometry analysis LC-ESI-HDMSE

### Data Protocol
Please provide a couple of sentences on the bioinformatics pipeline used, main search parameters, quantitative analysis, software tools and versions included. Think something similar in scope to the Data Analysis section of your manuscriptOur proteomic analysis revealed that the absence of EhCFIm25 produced significant changes in the abundance of 75 proteins. Interestingly, STRING analysis showed that modulated proteins correspond to three main groups. Functional GO-term annotations, KEGG analyses and literature review confirmed that they are related to glycolysis and carbon metabolism, cytoskeleton dynamics and parasite virulence, as well as gene expression and protein modifications.
