### Title
Comparison of purified membrane vesicles from L. casei submitted or not to density gradient ultracentrifugation

### Description
Probiotics are defined by the World Health Organization as “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”. A large number of probiotic bacteria used in the food industry are members of the diverse Lactobacillaceae family and are “Generally Regarded as Safe” (GRAS). Here, we aimed at characterizing the proteome of membrane vesicles (MVs) from Lacticasibacillus casei. We notably analyzed the proteomes of vesicles purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (pMVs) or not (MVs).

### Sample Protocol
L. casei strains were grown in Man-Rogosa-Sharpe medium (MRS; Conda) for 24 hours at 37°C under static conditions. For MV purification, a culture of L. casei (250 mL) was centrifuged at 4000 x g, 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 µm pore size filter (Nalgen Rapid-Flow) to remove remaining bacterial cells and concentrated by ultrafiltration at 4000 x g, 4°C with 100 K Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). The concentrated supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm-pore-size filter before ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g, 4°C for 2 hours. The pellet of MVs was resuspended in sterile PBS (1X) and stored as aliquots at -80°C. For further purification, MV pellet was loaded on top of an iodoxinol gradient of 5-40% and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 18 h at 4°C. The fraction containing the MVs was then collected and resuspended in PBS (1X) before a final ultracentrifugation at 110,000 x g for 2 h at 4°C. Finally, the purified MVs were resuspended in sterile PBS (1X) and stored as aliquots at -80°C. This sample is named pMVs. Three independent preparations of MVs and pMVs were analyzed. Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and heated for 10 min at 95°C. They were then separated by SDS-PAGE (4-12% NuPAGE, Life Technologies), stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) before in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade). For each replicate, the two very intense bands were prepared separately from the rest of the sample. The resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano and Orbitrap Exploris 480 for second experiment, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 35-min gradient for intense bands and 120-min gradient for the rests of the samples. For this purpose, the peptides were sampled on a precolumn (300 μm x 5 mm PepMap C18, Thermo Scientific) and separated in a 75 μm x 250 mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch). The MS and MS/MS data were acquired by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.7.0.1, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Microscope database (Lactobacillus casei BL23 taxonomy, April 2021 download), the Uniprot database (Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c and Bos Taurus taxonomies, June 2021 download), and a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (keratins, trypsin, etc.). Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable) and Oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software (version 2.1) was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 6 amino acids, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications < 1%, and a minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group).

### Publication Abstract
Biofilms represent a major concern in the food industry and healthcare. The use of probiotic bacteria and their derivatives as an alternative to conventional treatments to fight biofilm development is a promising option that has provided convincing results in the last decades. Recently, membrane vesicles (MVs) produced by probiotics have generated considerable interest due to the diversity of roles they have been associated with. However, the antimicrobial activity of probiotic MVs remains to be studied. In this work, we showed that membrane vesicles produced by Lacticaseibacillus casei BL23 (LC-MVs) exhibited strong antibiofilm activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) without affecting bacterial growth. Furthermore, we found that LC-MVs affected the early stages of S. Enteritidis biofilm development and prevented attachment of bacteria to polystyrene surfaces. Importantly, LC-MVs did not impact the biomass of already established biofilms. We also demonstrated that the antibiofilm activity depended on the proteins associated with the LC-MV fraction. Finally, two peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs) were found to be associated with the antibiofilm activity of LC-MVs. Overall, this work allowed to identify the antibiofilm properties of LC-MVs and paved the way for the use of probiotic MVs against the development of negative biofilms.
