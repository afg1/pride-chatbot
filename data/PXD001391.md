### Title
Metastasis-related Intracellular Proteins in Human Breast Cancer Cells

### Description
We have used a unique metastasis model system in combination with quantitative, comparative proteomics to identify novel markers associated with the ability of cancer cells to colonize and form metastasis, and subsequently analyzed the clinical relevance of these proteins using breast cancer biopsies from patients with known clinical outcome within a 10-year follow-up. The model system consists of two isogenic human breast cancer cell lines that are equally tumorigenic in mice, but one gives rise to metastasis while the other disseminates single cells that remain dormant in distant organs. Using stable isotopic labeling by amino acids in cell culture and subcellular fractionation, the nuclear, cytosol and mitochondria proteomes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identifying seven proteins that exhibited altered expression between the cell lines, including L-lactate dehydrogenase A, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), niemann-pick c1 protein, and nucleolar RNA helicase 2.

### Sample Protocol
Quantification using SILAC (13C6-L-arginine and 13C6-L-lysine) Density based separation of nuclei, cytosol (3 biological replicates) and mitochondria (3 biological replicates) 50ug protein digested using trypsin for 3 techinal replicates. Q-TOF Micro/premier tandem mass spectrometer (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK)

### Data Protocol
Peak list files were created using Masslynx 4.0  The data was searched against all human proteins and common contaminants (n=77317) in the MSIPI database as of the 1st of April 2009 (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IPI/msipi/) using an in house Mascot server v2.2  Peak list files were recalibrated using the in-house developed Perl script MSRecal and relative quantification of stable isotope-labeled peptides was performed using MSQuant v1.5  The quantifications were normalized to their collective median and imported via a CSV format to ProteinCenter v2.8.1

### Publication Abstract
Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths and remains the most significant challenge to management of the disease. Metastases are established through a complex multistep process involving intracellular signaling pathways. To gain insight to proteins central to specific steps in metastasis formation, we used a metastasis cell line model that allows investigation of extravasation and colonization of circulating cancer cells to lungs in mice. Using stable isotopic labeling by amino acids in cell culture and subcellular fractionation, the nuclear, cytosol, and mitochondria proteomes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identifying a number of proteins that exhibited altered expression in isogenic metastatic versus nonmetastatic cancer cell lines, including NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), l-lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), Niemann-pick c1 protein (NPC1), and nucleolar RNA helicase 2 (NRH2). The altered expression levels were validated at the protein and transcriptional levels, and analysis of breast cancer biopsies from two cohorts of patients demonstrated a significant correlation between high CYB5R3 expression and poor disease-free and overall survival in patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors (DFS: p = .02, OS: p = .04). CYB5R3 gene knock-down using siRNA in metastasizing cells led to significantly decreased tumor burden in lungs when injected intravenously in immunodeficient mice. The cellular effects of CYB5R3 knock-down showed signaling alterations associated with extravasation, TGF&#x3b2; and HIF&#x3b1; pathways, and apoptosis. The decreased apoptosis of CYB5R3 knock-down metastatic cancer cell lines was confirmed in functional assays. Our study reveals a central role of CYB5R3 in extravasation/colonization of cancer cells and demonstrates the ability of our quantitative, comparative proteomic approach to identify key proteins of specific important biological processes that may also prove useful as potential biomarkers of clinical relevance. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001391.
