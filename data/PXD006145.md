### Title
The sheep host fecal proteome -  The Sarda Sheep Host Fecal Proteome

### Description
Characterization of the fecal (host) proteome in 5 Sarda sheep

### Sample Protocol
Experiments and related protocols are described in Tanca et al. Microb Biotechnol 2017

### Data Protocol
MS spectra were reanalyzed using a host-specific protein database. Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was employed as informatic platform to carry out peptide identification. Spectra were pre-processed through the "Spectrum Selector" node, setting 350–5,000 Da as precursor mass range and 1.5 as signal-to-noise threshold; Sequest-HT was used as search engine, with the following parameters: trypsin as enzyme; 2 maximum missed cleavage sites; 5–50 amino acids as peptide length range; 0.05 as maximum delta Cn; 10 ppm as precursor mass tolerance; 0.02 Da as fragment mass tolerance; cysteine carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation as static and dynamic modification, respectively. Peptide validation was carried out using Percolator, setting an FDR <1% based on the peptide q-value. Results were filtered in order to keep only rank 1 peptides, and protein grouping was allowed according to the maximum parsimony principle. The host-specific protein database comprised all sequences deposited in UniProtKB (2015_03 release) and belonging to the sub-order Ruminantia

### Publication Abstract
The first characterization of the sheep fecal microbiota was recently reported, as obtained by using a multi meta-omic approach. Here, the mass spectra generated by single-run LC/high-resolution MS in the context of that study were reanalyzed using a host-specific database, in order to gain insights for the first time into the host fecal proteome of healthy Sarda sheep. On the whole, 5349 non-redundant tryptic peptide sequences were identified, belonging to 1046 different proteins. The "core" fecal proteome (common to all animals) comprised 431 proteins, mainly related to biological processes as immune response and proteolysis. Proteins involved in the immune/inflammatory response and peptidases were specifically investigated. This dataset provides novel insights into the repertoire of proteins secreted in the sheep intestinal lumen, and constitutes the basis for future shotgun and targeted proteomics studies aimed at monitoring changes in the sheep fecal proteome in response to production variables, infectious/inflammatory states, and variations in the gut microbiota. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006145.
