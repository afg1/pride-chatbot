### Title
Development of an in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide in mammalian cell-based protein production.

### Description
Optimizing appropriate signal peptides in mammalian cell-based protein production is crucial given that most recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cells are thought to be secreted proteins. Until now, most studies on signal peptide in mammalian cells have replaced native signal peptides with well-known heterologous signal peptides and bioinformatics-based signal peptides. In the present study, we successfully established an in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide in CHO cells by combining a degenerate codon-based oligonucleotides library, a site-specific integration system, and a FACS-based antibody detection assay. Three new signal peptides were screened using this new screening system, confirming to have structural properties as signal peptides by the SignalP web server, a neural network-based algorithm that quantifies the signal peptide-ness of amino acid sequences. The novel signal peptides selected in this study increased Fc-fusion protein production in CHO cells by increasing specific protein productivity, while it did not negatively affect cell growth. In addition, replacing native signal peptide with the novel signal peptides did not significantly affect sialylated N-glycan formation, N-terminal cleavage pattern, and biological function of Fc-fusion protein produced in CHO cells. The overall results indicate the utility of a novel in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide for mammalian cell-based protein production.

### Sample Protocol
Analyzing the N-terminal sequence of Fc-fusion protein  Purified Fc-fusion glycoprotein was supplemented with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 M Dithiothreitol (DTT; Cytiva) at room temperature for 1 h, and 0.5 M Iodoacetamide (IAA; Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Digestion was performed using sequencing-grade Chymotrypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 25°C for 16 h. Peptide samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants were sampled. Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed on a UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide samples were loaded onto an AcclaimTM PepMapTM 100 C18 LC trapping column (5 m, 100 m × 20 mm). The trapping column was subsequently switched online to AcclaimTM PepMapTM 100 C18 LC analytical column (2 m, 75 m × 150 mm), and peptides were separated by a 60 min gradient. We performed mass spectrometer (MS) detection on a Q ExactiveTM Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Full scan MS spectra from 150 to 2000 m/z and the 1e6 AGC target were obtained by data dependent acquisition with a 70,000 resolution. Further, MS analysis was performed in dd-MS2 (HCD) scan type (5e4 AGC target, 50 ms maximum ion time, 3 s cycle time, 2.0 ± 0.6 m/z isolation window, 100 m/z fixed first mass, 30% HCD energy).

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were processed using BioPharma Finder ver. 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a peptide mapping analysis software. We then performed N-terminal peptide quantification and visualization using FreeStyle ver. 1.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by calculating the peak area of the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm.

### Publication Abstract
Optimizing appropriate signal peptides in mammalian cell-based protein production is crucial given that most recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cells are thought to be secreted proteins. Until now, most studies on signal peptide in mammalian cells have replaced native signal peptides with well-known heterologous signal peptides and bioinformatics-based signal peptides. In the present study, we successfully established an in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide in CHO cells by combining a degenerate codon-based oligonucleotides library, a site-specific integration system, and a FACS-based antibody detection assay. Three new signal peptides were screened using this new screening system, confirming to have structural properties as signal peptides by the SignalP web server, a neural network-based algorithm that quantifies the signal peptide-ness of amino acid sequences. The novel signal peptides selected in this study increased Fc-fusion protein production in CHO cells by increasing specific protein productivity, whereas they did not negatively affect cell growth. Particularly, the SP-#149 clone showed the highest q<sub>p</sub>, 0.73&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.01&#xa0;pg/cell/day from day 1 to day 4, representing a 1.47-fold increase over the native signal peptide in a serum-free suspension culture mode. In addition, replacing native signal peptide with the novel signal peptides did not significantly affect sialylated N-glycan formation, N-terminal cleavage pattern, and biological function of Fc-fusion protein produced in CHO cells. The overall results indicate the utility of a novel in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide for mammalian cell-based protein production. KEY POINTS: &#x2022; An in vitro screening system for synthetic signal peptide in mammalian cells was established &#x2022; This system combined a degenerate codon-based library, site-specific integration, and a FACS-based detection assay &#x2022; The novel signal peptides selected in this study could increase Fc-fusion protein production in mammalian cells.
