### Title
Regulation of Src tumor activity by its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region

### Description
The membrane anchored Src tyrosine kinase is involved in numerous pathways and its deregulation is involved in human cancer. Our knowledge on Src regulation relies on crystallography, which revealed intramolecular interactions to control active Src conformations. However, Src contains a N-terminal intrinsically disordered unique domain (UD) whose function remains unclear. Using NMR, we reported that UD forms an intramolecular fuzzy complex involving a conserved region with lipid-binding capacity named Unique Lipid Binding Region (ULBR), which could modulate Src membrane anchoring. Here we show that the ULBR is essential for Src’s oncogenic capacity. ULBR inactive mutations inhibited Src transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells and in human colon cancer cells. It also reduced Src-induced tumor development in nude mice. An intact ULBR was required for MAPK signaling without affecting Src kinase activity nor sub-cellular localization. Phospho-proteomic analyses revealed that, while not impacting on the global tyrosine phospho-proteome in colon cancer cells, this region modulates phosphorylation of specific membrane-localized tyrosine kinases needed for Src oncogenic signaling, including EPHA2 and Fyn. Collectively, this study reveals an important role of this intrinsically disordered region in malignant cell transformation and suggests a novel layer of Src regulation by this unique region via membrane substrate phosphorylation.

### Sample Protocol
Briefly, SW620 cells were lysed in urea buffer (8M urea in 200mM ammonium bicarbonate pH7.5). Phosphopeptides were purified after tryptic digestion of 20 mg (for cells) or of 35 mg (formouse tumors) total proteins using the PTMScan® Phospho-Tyrosine Rabbit mAb (P-Tyr-1000) Kit (Cell Signaling Technology), according to manufacturer’s protocol. An additional enrichment step using the IMAC-Select Affinity Gel (Sigma Aldrich) was performed to increase the phosphopeptide enrichment. Purified phosphopeptides were resuspended in 10% formic acid and two technical replicates for each sample were analyzed. Nano-flow separations were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano UPLC system (Thermo Fischer Scientific) on-line connected with a Qexactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). A homemade capillary pre-column (Magic AQ C18; 3μm by 200Å; 2 cm x 100 μm ID) was used for sample trapping and cleaning. Separations were performed on a C18 tip-capillary column (Nikkyo Technos Co; Magic AQ C18; 3μm by 100Å; 15 cm x 75 μm) at 250 nl/min over 150 min. biphasic gradients.

### Data Protocol
Database search was performed using MaxQuant 1.6.2.10 against the Uniprot human reference proteome (release 2018_12,73928 sequences). Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation (M), phosphorylation (S, T, Y) and acetylation (Protein N-term) were considered as variable modifications. A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. "Match between runs" was enabled. A minimum of 1 peptide was allowed for protein identification, and the false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off was set at 0.01 for both peptides and proteins. Label-free quantification and normalization were performed by Maxquant using the MaxLFQ algorithm, with the standard settings.

### Publication Abstract
The membrane-anchored Src tyrosine kinase is involved in numerous pathways and its deregulation is involved in human cancer. Our knowledge on Src regulation relies on crystallography, which revealed intramolecular interactions to control active Src conformations. However, Src contains a N-terminal intrinsically disordered unique domain (UD) whose function remains unclear. Using NMR, we reported that UD forms an intramolecular fuzzy complex involving a conserved region with lipid-binding capacity named Unique Lipid-Binding Region (ULBR), which could modulate Src membrane anchoring. Here we show that the ULBR is essential for Src's oncogenic capacity. ULBR inactive mutations inhibited Src transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells and in human colon cancer cells. It also reduced Src-induced tumor development in nude mice. An intact ULBR was required for MAPK signaling without affecting Src kinase activity nor sub-cellular localization. Phospho-proteomic analyses revealed that, while not impacting on the global tyrosine phospho-proteome in colon cancer cells, this region modulates phosphorylation of specific membrane-localized tyrosine kinases needed for Src oncogenic signaling, including EPHA2 and Fyn. Collectively, this study reveals an important role of this intrinsically disordered region in malignant cell transformation and suggests a novel layer of Src regulation by this unique region via membrane substrate phosphorylation.
