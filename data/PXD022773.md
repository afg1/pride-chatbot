### Title
GAK and PRKCD are positive regulators of Parkin-independent mitophagy

### Description
Mitophagy plays a key cellular role for the programmed or damage induced removal of mitochondria, however, precisely how this process is orchestrated in response to different stimuli still requires investigation. In this work we have screened for regulators of PARKIN-independent mitophagy using an siRNA library targeting 200 proteins containing lipid interacting domains. We identify Cyclin-G associated kinase (GAK) and Protein Kinase C Delta (PRKCD) as novel regulators of PARKIN independent mitophagy. We demonstrate that the kinase activity of both GAK and PRKCD are required for efficient mitophagy in vitro, that PRKCD is present on mitochondria, and that PRKCD is required for ULK1/ATG13 recruitment to early autophagic structures. Importantly, we demonstrate in vivo relevance for both kinases in the regulation of basal mitophagy. Knockdown of GAK homologue (gakh-1) in C.elegans or PRKCD homologues in zebrafish led to significant inhibition of mitophagy, highlighting the evolutionary relevance of these kinases in mitophagy

### Sample Protocol
Cells were dissolved in RIPA buffer and further homogenized with sonicator (30 sec x 3 times with 30 sec interval) and in soluble material was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentration was estimated by BCA assay (Pierce) and for each replicates equal amount of 600ug and 30ug of protein samples reduced and alkylated and further digested by FASP (Filter added sample preparation) method for Phosphoproteomics and whole cell lysate proteomics respectively. Digested peptides were transferred to new tube, acidified and the peptides were de-salted using Oasis cartridges for STY peptides enrichments. Phosphorylated peptides enrichment was performed based on TiO2 (Casado et al., 2013). Enriched peptides fractions were de-salted by C18 stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Raw files from LC-MS/MS analyses were submitted to MaxQuant 1.6.1.0 software (cox and mann, 2008.,) for peptide/protein identification. Parameters were set as follow: Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification and PTY; protein N-acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. First search error window of 20 ppm and mains search error of 6 ppm. Trypsin without proline restriction enzyme option was used, with two allowed miscleavages. Minimal unique peptides were set to one, and FDR allowed was 0.01 (1%) for peptide and protein identification. The Uniprot human database was used. Generation of reversed sequences was selected to assign FDR rates. MaxQuant output files (proteinGroups.txt for proteomic data and STY(sites).txt for phosphoproteomic data) were loaded into the Perseus software (Tyanova et all., 2016). Identifications from potential contaminants and reversed sequences were removed and intensities were transformed to log2. Identified phosphorylation sites were filtered only for those that were confidently localized (class I, localization probability ≥ 0.75). Next, required at least 75% valid values in at least one group used to filter identification. All zero intensity values were replaced using noise values of the normal distribution of each sample. Protein or STY abundances were compared using LFQ intensity values and a two-sample Student’s T-test (permutation-based FDR correction (250 randomizations), FDR cut-off: 0.05, S0: 0.1).
