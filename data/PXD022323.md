### Title
Deletion of Allele-Specific HLAs (DASH)

### Description
Evaluting HLA loss of heterozygosity, a key immune escape mechanism, using NGS and immunopeptidomics.

### Sample Protocol
MHC-peptide complexes were immunoprecipitated using W6/32 antibody. Peptides were gently eluted using mild acid, tumor/normal pair was labelled with TMT, mixed and analyzed on a mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using the standard PEAKs pipeline, using uniprot protein sequence database. PEAKs quant module was used to extract reporter ion intensities.Â  Parameters for database search were as follows -- precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 0.03 Da, protein database: uniprot sequences downloaded in April 2019, enzyme digestion: none, fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.02 Da) and TMT10plex at all N-terminal amino acids and lysines (+2291.6), variable modifications: protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106) and oxidation of Methionine (+15.9949). Peptides were filtered at 1% FDR and further post processed using in-house scripts to remove spurious peptides (e.g. peptides without TMT modifications).
