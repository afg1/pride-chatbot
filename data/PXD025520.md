### Title
The interactome of Zbtb2 in mouse embryonic stem cells

### Description
Zbtb2 is a transcription factor that plays a role in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation. We pulled-down endogenously tagged Zbtb2-FLAG in mESCs and found a complex interactome. We characterized the Zbtb2 complex further by co-pull-downs of overexpressed Zbtb2-AVI, after mutation of individual Zbtb2 domains or of complex subunits, as well as by taking advantage of a tagged construct displaying dominant negative activity (Zbtb2-HAF).

### Sample Protocol
FLAG and Streptavidin pull-downs For the FLAG pull-downs of endogenously tagged Zbtb2-FLAG, 107 mESCs E14 Zbtb2-FLAG or WT E14 (negative control) were switched from 2iLIF to Serum-LIF culture conditions and harvested after 48 hours as described below. For the Streptavidin pull-downs of overexpressed Zbtb2-AVI, 2*105 WT or mutant naïve TNG-A cells grown in 2iLIF were transfected with 1g pgk>BirA plasmid and 1g DOX>prey plasmid or no plasmid as negative control with 3L Lipofectamin 2000. The next day fresh 2iLIF medium with hygromycin (selection for the pgk>BirA plasmid) was applied. Cells were grown in selective medium for 3-4 days and then the medium was changed to Serum-LIF + 1g/mL Doxycycline. After 48 hours 107 cells were harvested with trypsin, washed in PBS-0.1%BSA, washed in PBS, and nuclei were extracted in 10mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 10mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 0.5% IGEPAL, with Complete protease inhibitor for 20’ minutes on ice. Nuclei were lysed by rotation for 1h at 4C in 20mM TrisHCl 7.5, 100mMKCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5% TritonX-100, Complete protease inhibitor, Phosphatase inhibitor, and 250U/mL benzonase. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5’ at 12’000g at 4C; 5L of protein-G Dynabeads conjugated with 2 g of FLAG-M2 Ab or 10L of M280 Streptavidin-Dynabeads were added and incubated at 4C rotating for 4h. Beads were then washed three times with 20mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, with 0.5% IGEPAL and twice without IGEPAL. Protein on beads were digested with Lys-C at RT for 4h and then with trypsin overnight at 37C.  LC-MS analysis The generated peptides were acidified with TFA to a final concentration of 0.8% and analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with an EASY-nLC 1000 using the two column set-up (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were loaded with 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile in H2O onto a peptide trap (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75um x 2cm, C18, 3um, 100Å) at a constant pressure of 800 bar. Peptides were separated, at a flow rate of 150 nl/min with a linear gradient of 2–6% buffer B in buffer A in 3 minutes followed by an linear increase from 6 to 22% in 40 minutes, 22-28% in 9 min, 28-36% in 8min, 36-80% in 1 min and the column was finally washed for 14 min at 80% B (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) on a 50um x 15cm ES801 C18, 2um, 100Å column (Thermo Scientific) mounted on a DPV ion source (New Objective) connected to a Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Scientific). The data were acquired using 120000 resolution for the peptide measurements in the Orbitrap and a top T (3s) method with HCD fragmentation for each precursor and fragment measurement in the ion trap according the recommendation of the manufacturer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and relative quantification of the proteins was done with MaxQuant version 1.5.3.8 using Andromeda as search engine (Cox et al., 2011) and label free quantification (LFQ. Cox et al., 2014) as described in Hubner et al. The mouse subset of the UniProt data base combined with the contaminant DB from MaxQuant was searched and the protein and peptide FDR were set to 0.01. All MaxQuant parameters can be found in the uploaded parameterfiles mqpar.xml.
