### Title
Retinoic acid effect on cardiac mitochondria

### Description
Using H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, we have shown that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, affects mitochondrial dynamics at 10nM concentration. The low dose ATRA stimulates the expression of nuclear retinoid receptors and induces mechanisms that are protective against severe point damage caused by laser irradiation at the mitochondrial level. To determine the protective effect of ATRA against photodamage, we used the proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to compare the abundancies of proteins between control and ATRA-treated cardiomyoblasts.

### Sample Protocol
Starting material of 5.106 cells was dried in a centrifugal SpeedVac concentrator. The dried cells were diluted with 8 M urea and 100 mM NH4HCO3. Dithiothreitol (DTT) at a concentration of 30 mM was added as a reducing solution (5 mM DTT in the sample) and samples were incubated for 30 min at 56 °C in a Thermal Shake lite heater (VWR, Leuven, Belgium). The reduction was followed by alkylation via the addition of 105 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) (15 mM of IAA in the sample) with a subsequent 20 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature. The process of alkylation was stopped by adding DTT (5 mM DTT in the sample). The urea in the sample was diluted to 1.4 M by adding 100 mM NH4HCO3. The proteins were digested by trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US) at a concentration of trypsin 0.2 μg/μL (dissolved in 100 mM NH4HCO3) overnight at 37 °C. The next day, formic acid was added to a concentration of 1% in the sample. The sample was sonicated, centrifuged at 14 000 x g and further desalted by using C18-U SPE column (Strata, Phenomenex).

### Data Protocol
Analysis by Nano-Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano System liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, Germany) with an Amazon SL, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer and a 3D ion trap mass analyzer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) were used for protein analysis. The mobile phase consisted of component A (0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile (ACN)) and component B (0.1% formic acid in 95% ACN). The loading phase consisted of 0.05% formic acid in 2% ACN. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.4 μL/min with a gradient in length: 0%–35% B for 255 min followed by 10 min at 90% B. The analyzed samples were separated on a 75 μm × 300 mm column with a 3 μm particle size at 100 Å and 40 °C. The spectrometer parameters were set as follows: 1450 V capillary voltage, 0.4 Ψ atomizer pressure, 3.0 L/min gas flow rate, 150 °C gas temperature, positive polarity, and scan range 50−2200 m/z at a scan rate of 8100 m/z/sec. Database Searching and Protein Identification. To define input LC-MS/MS methods and describe analyzed samples, the HyStar program was used. The obtained spectra and chromatograms were processed using Data Analysis software, and correlation analysis was performed by Proteinscape software. The Mascot server 2.5.0. was used as an annotated search library for protein identification. Analysis of proteomic datasets. In this study, we defined strict inclusion criteria for quantification. Samples were prepared as technical duplicates for 3 biological replicates in every group. Every sample had 2 runs of mass spectra.  We evaluated proteins which occurred in intersection of all three groups.  The protein abundancies were evaluated by their exponentially modified Protein Abundance Indexes (emPAI), parameters used for relative protein quantitation of proteomic datasets.

### Publication Abstract
Using H9C2 cardiomyoblasts, we have shown that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, affects mitochondrial dynamics and functions. The low dose (10&#x2009;nM) ATRA stimulates the expression of nuclear retinoid receptors and induces mechanisms that are protective against severe local damage caused by laser irradiation at the mitochondrial level. These changes include increased density of the mitochondrial network, higher number of mitochondrial junctions, and enhanced mitochondrial velocity. Moreover, the treated cells had lower basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and could maintain mitochondrial potential (&#x394;&#x3a8;<sub>m</sub> ) after photodamage. Cells treated with 10&#x2009;nM ATRA had significantly better survival rate after photodamage in comparison to control cells. Cells treated with pharmacological concentration of ATRA (1&#x2009;&#xb5;M) expressed higher mitochondrial connectivity without increased motility, which did not lead to better survival or decreased ROS level as was in the case of low-dose ATRA. The proteomics analysis showed changes in proteins related to cellular metabolism (glycolysis) and respiration in ATRA-treated cells. The l-lactate assay confirmed the shift to anaerobic glycolysis in cells treated with 1&#x2009;&#xb5;m ATRA, whereas the 10&#x2009;nM ATRA decreased the level of lactate in medium. The increased levels of cytochrome c or peroxiredoxins 5 level and also lower expression of retinoid and rexinoid receptors were observed in cells treated with 1&#x2009;&#xb5;M ATRA. The effect of ATRA is concentration-dependent; the increased mitochondrial dynamics and slower metabolism at 10&#x2009;nM ATRA contributed significantly to the chance of survival of the cells after photodamage whereas the higher concentration of ATRA overrode the protective effect and led to the unfavorable ones.
