### Title
Reverse Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (R-ChIP) to investigate the upstream regulators of a specific gene（CAT3 Promoter）-722

### Description
This project aim to explore the gene-centered approaches to investigate the interaction between DNA and protein

### Sample Protocol
We use 12 probes with biotin labeled at 5’ DNA terminal to hybridize with crosslinked DNA-protein complex and then use LC-MS to get the protein interact with specific DNA sequence.

### Data Protocol
The database we use is uniprot_Arabidopsis_thaliana_89148_20180815.fasta

### Publication Abstract
None

### Keywords
Reverse chip arabidopsis thaliana nucleus cat3 promoter
