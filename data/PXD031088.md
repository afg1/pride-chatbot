### Title
Fatty acid transport protein 2 interacts with ceramide synthase 2 to regulate ceramide synthesis

### Description
Dihydroceramide is generated via the action of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerSs), which use two substrates, namely sphinganine and fatty acyl CoAs. Sphinganine is generated via the sequential activity of two integral membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Less is known about the source of supply of the fatty acyl CoAs, although a number of cytosolic proteins in the pathways of acyl CoA generation have been shown to modulate ceramide synthesis via direct or indirect interaction with the CerSs. We now demonstrate, by proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins, that fatty acid transporter protein 2 (FATP2) (also known as very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase) directly interacts with CerS2 in mouse liver. Studies in cultured cells demonstrated that other members of the FATP family can also interact with CerS2, with the interaction dependent on both proteins being catalytically active. Transfection of cells with FATP1, FATP2 or FATP4 increased ceramide levels although only FATP2 and 4 increased dihydroceramide levels, consistent with their known intracellular locations. Finally, lipofermata, an FATP2 inhibitor which is believed to directly impact tumor cell growth via modulation of FATP2, decreased de novo dihydroceramide synthesis, suggesting that some of the proposed therapeutic effects of lipofermata may actually be mediated via (dihydro)ceramide rather than directly via acyl CoA generation

### Sample Protocol
Eluted proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide in the dark. Each sample was loaded onto S-Trap microcolumns (Protifi, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, after loading, samples were washed with 90:10% methanol/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were then digested with 500 ng trypsin for 1.5 h at 47°C. The digested peptides were eluted using 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate; trypsin was added to this fraction and incubated overnight at 37°C. Two more elutions were performed using 0.2% formic acid and 0.2% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile (v/v). The three elutions were pooled together and vacuum-centrifuged to dry. Samples were kept at −80°C until analysis. ULC/MS grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps. Each sample was loaded using split-less nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (10 kpsi M-Class; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was: A) H2O + 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Desalting of the samples was performed online using a reversed-phase Symmetry C18 trapping column (180 µm internal diameter, 20 mm length, 5 µm particle size; Waters). Peptides were separated using a T3 HSS nano-column (75 µm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 1.8 µm particle size; Waters) at 0.35 µL/min. Peptides were eluted from the column into the mass spectrometer using the following gradient: 4% to 30%B in 50 min, 30% to 90%B in 5 min, maintained at 90% for 5 min and then back to initial conditions. The nanoUPLC was coupled online through a nanoESI emitter (10 μm tip; New Objective; Woburn, MA, USA) to a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) using a FlexIon nanospray apparatus (Proxeon). Data was acquired in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, using a Top10 method. MS1 resolution was set to 70,000 (at 400 m/z), mass range of 375-1650 m/z, AGC of 3e6 and maximum injection time was set to 60 msec. MS2 resolution was set to 17,500, quadrupole isolation 1.7 m/z, AGC of 1e6, dynamic exclusion of 30  sec  and maximum injection time of 60 msec

### Data Protocol
Raw data was processed with MaxQuant v1.6.0.16. The data was searched with the Andromeda search engine against the Uniprot human proteome database appended with common lab protein contaminants and the following modifications: Carbamidomethylation of C as a fixed modification, oxidation of M and deamidation of N and Q as variable ones. The LFQ intensities (Label-Free Quantification) were calculated and used for further calculations using Perseus v1.6.0.7. Decoy hits were filtered out, as well as proteins that were identified on the basis of one modified peptide only. The data was further filtered to include only proteins with at least 2 valid values in at least one of the groups and then the data was imputed and GO annotations added. A Student’s t-Test, after logarithmic transformation, was used to identify significant differences across the biological replica. Fold-changes were calculated based on the ratio of geometric means of the different compared groups

### Publication Abstract
Dihydroceramide is a lipid molecule generated via the action of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerSs), which use two substrates, namely sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoAs. Sphinganine is generated via the sequential activity of two integral membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Less is known about the source of the fatty acyl-CoAs, although a number of cytosolic proteins in the pathways of acyl-CoA generation modulate ceramide synthesis via direct or indirect interaction with the CerSs. In this study, we demonstrate, by proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins, that fatty acid transporter protein 2 (FATP2) (also known as very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase) directly interacts with CerS2 in mouse liver. Studies in cultured cells demonstrated that other members of the FATP family can also interact with CerS2, with the interaction dependent on both proteins being catalytically active. In addition, transfection of cells with FATP1, FATP2, or FATP4 increased ceramide levels although only FATP2 and 4 increased dihydroceramide levels, consistent with their known intracellular locations. Finally, we show that lipofermata, an FATP2 inhibitor which is believed to directly impact tumor cell growth via modulation of FATP2, decreased de novo dihydroceramide synthesis, suggesting that some of the proposed therapeutic effects of lipofermata may be mediated via (dihydro)ceramide rather than directly via acyl-CoA generation. In summary, our study reinforces the idea that manipulating the pathway of fatty acyl-CoA generation will impact a wide variety of down-stream lipids, not least the sphingolipids, which utilize two acyl-CoA moieties in the initial steps of their synthesis.
