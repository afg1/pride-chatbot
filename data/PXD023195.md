### Title
N-terminal acetylation in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the effects of Naa10/15 or HypK knock-outs

### Description
This project is about the study of the effects of several proteins on the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and more specifically on the N-terminal acetylome of this plant. To this end were analysed KO samples of either an N-alpha acetyltransferase (Naa10 or Naa15) or the chaperonne protein HypK.

### Sample Protocol
The plant samples were processed following the SILProNAQ protocol described by Bienvenut et al. in Methods Mol Biol. (2017). Briefly, it is based on the chemical acetylation of all the naturally non-acetylated protein N-termini, using a heavy labeled reagent. This allows then for a calculation of an N-terminal acetylation proportion for each protein by comparing the amount of natural acetylation to that of artificial acetylation.

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometry spectra were acquired usin an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer, and the data files of each sample were processed together using the Mascot Distiller software, searching against the curated Araport-11 database, for protein identification and quantification. The results obtained from Mascot Distiller were then parsed using the eNcounter script to ahcieve the final N-terminal acetylation results.

### Publication Abstract
In humans, the Huntingtin yeast partner K (HYPK) binds to the ribosome-associated <i>N</i><sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex that acetylates ~40% of the proteome in humans and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. However, the relevance of <i>Hs</i>HYPK for determining the human N-acetylome is unclear. Here, we identify the <i>At</i>HYPK protein as the first in vivo regulator of NatA activity in plants<i>. At</i>HYPK physically interacts with the ribosome-anchoring subunit of NatA and promotes N<sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-terminal acetylation of diverse NatA substrates. Loss-of-<i>At</i>HYPK mutants are remarkably resistant to drought stress and strongly resemble the phenotype of NatA-depleted plants. The ectopic expression of <i>Hs</i>HYPK rescues this phenotype. Combined transcriptomics, proteomics, and N-terminomics unravel that HYPK impairs plant metabolism and development, predominantly by regulating NatA activity. We demonstrate that HYPK is a critical regulator of global proteostasis by facilitating masking of the recently identified nonAc-X<sup>2</sup>/N-degron. This N-degron targets many nonacetylated NatA substrates for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
