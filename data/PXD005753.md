### Title
PTMs of HTT protein -  Post-translational modifications (PTMs), identified on endogenous huntingtin, cluster within proteolytic domains between HEAT repeats

### Description
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins regulate various cellular processes. PTMs of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (Htt) protein, causative of Huntington’s disease (HD), are likely modulators of HD pathogenesis.   Previous studies have identified and characterized several PTMs on exogenously expressed Htt fragments, however none of these studies were designed to systematically characterize PTMs on the endogenous full-length Htt protein.We found that full-length endogenous Htt, immunoprecipitated from HD knock-in mouse and human post mortem brain, is suitable for detection of PTMs by mass spectrometry. Using label-free mass spectrometry, we identified around 40 PTMs, of which half are novel. These findings will be instrumental in the further assembling the Htt PTM framework, and validate PTMs of Htt as promising therapeutic targets for HD.

### Sample Protocol
Total cell homogenates from whole mouse brain (KI Q175 and WT controls at 6 months of age) or human superior frontal gyrus (500 mg of frozen brain tissue) of HD and normal control cases were prepared by the Dounce homogenization in Triton lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X100, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III (Calbiochem) and Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific), followed by centrifugation at 13,000 g.  Lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4oC, followed by the incubation (overnight, at 4oC) with the primary anti-Htt antibody (MAB 2166, Millipore) to IP normal Htt, or with MW1 polyQ-specific antibody (Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) to IP expanded Htt, and then were incubated with Protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4oC. The IPs were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer, and Htt proteins were eluted from the beads with heating (80oC) in 2xSDS Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad), followed by fractionation on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (PAGE, GE Healthcare). Htt protein bands were visualized with SimplyBlue Safe Stain (ThermoScientific).Normal and polyQ -expanded Htt protein bands were cut out of the gel, and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin. For phosphopeptide mapping, 50% of the extracted peptides was enriched for phosphopepitdes using titanium dioxide (TiO2). Both enriched and non-enriched fractions were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS).

### Data Protocol
Peptide sequences were identified from isotopically resolved masses in MS and MS/MS spectra extracted with and without deconvolution using Thermo Scientific MS2 processor and Xtract software. Mascot software (Version 2.2 www.matrixscience.com/)  interfaced in the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (http://portal.thermo-brims.com/ ) was used to identify and quantify peptides by searching the MS data against the Refseq mouse 2012 database (concatenated with the reverse database) with the following criteria: sample’s species; trypsin  chymotrypsin  as the enzyme allowing one missed cleavage; methionine oxidation, asparagine and glutamine deamidation, serine, threonine and tyrosin phosphorylation and lysine acetylation  as variable modifications.
