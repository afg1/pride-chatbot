### Title
Protein partners identification in Pyrococcus abyssi by nanoLC-MSMS

### Description
Recombinant aRNase J from P. abyssi, with C-terminal (His)6-tag (aRNase J-His), was produced, purified and used as baits for AP-MS experiments. In order to discriminate specific protein interaction from column background, we performed mock AP-MS analyses with P. abyssi cell extracts in absence of protein bait. In addition, to determine if some interactions are mediated through RNA or DNA, we implemented a nuclease treatment after incubating the cell extract with the bait. The co-purified partners were identified by bottom-up proteomic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from pull-down analysis were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel where bands were excised. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed. Peptides were analysed using a NanoLC-Ultra system (Eksigent) connected to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Electron) by a nanoelectrospray ion source.

### Data Protocol
Peptides and proteins were identified with X!TandemPipeline (open source software developped by PAPPSO facilities, X!Tandem version 3.3.4).
