### Title
Hair Proteome Variation at Different Body Locations on GVP Detection for Protein-Based Human Identification

### Description
Characterization of body location-specific hair proteomic variation and its effect on the identification of genetically variant peptide markers for protein-based human identification. LLNL-MI-756827

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted via ultrasonication and concentrated via spin filter concentration before trypsin digestion for data-dependent nano-LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Protein and peptide identifications were performed using a combination of de novo sequencing and database searching in PEAKS Studio 8.5. The UniProtKB SwissProt database and an individualized database generated from variants detected in exome sequence data were searched per sample. Parameters include precursor ion mass tolerance of Â±20 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, up to 3 PTMs per peptide allowed, and up to 3 tryptic missed cleavages on either side of the peptide. Only de novo-sequenced peptides with -10lgP greater than 15% were matched to protein sequences during database searching.

### Publication Abstract
Human hair contains minimal intact nuclear DNA for human identification in forensic and archaeological applications. In contrast, proteins offer a pathway to exploit hair evidence for human identification owing to their persistence, abundance, and derivation from DNA. Individualizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are often conserved as single amino acid polymorphisms in genetically variant peptides (GVPs). Detection of GVP markers in the hair proteome via high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry permits inference of SNPs with known statistical probabilities. To adopt this approach for forensic investigations, hair proteomic variation and its effects on GVP identification must first be characterized. This research aimed to assess variation in single-inch head, arm, and pubic hair, and discover body location-invariant GVP markers to distinguish individuals. Comparison of protein profiles revealed greater body location-specific variation in keratin-associated proteins and intracellular proteins, allowing body location differentiation. However, robust GVP markers derive primarily from keratins that do not exhibit body location-specific differential expression, supporting GVP identification independence from hair proteomic variation at the various body locations. Further, pairwise comparisons of GVP profiles with 8 SNPs demonstrated greatest interindividual variation and high intraindividual consistency, enabling similar differentiative potential of individuals using single hairs irrespective of body location origin.
