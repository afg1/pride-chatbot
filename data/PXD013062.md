### Title
Effect of FAK K454R mutation or knockout on composition of extracellular matrix and associated membrane proteins in 3D culture of  ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells

### Description
ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells with or without K454R mutant and knockout of FAK were cultured as spheroid cultures. The cells were hypotonically lysed and washed out, and the insoluble material was analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

### Sample Protocol
The ECM-enriched protein extracts from 3D cultures were precipitated with six volumes of acetone at -20Ã‚Â°C overnight. The precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 20 000 x g and +4Ã‚Â°C for 15 min, acetone was removed and samples were dried. Samples were suspended in solution containing 8 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The cysteines were reduced in 10 mM dithiotreitol at 37Ã‚Â°C with continuous agitation at 650 rpm for 2 h and alkylated in 40 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature, protected from light for 1 h. The remaining of iodoacetamide was inhibited by addition of dithiotreitol. The proteins were digested with Trypsin/LysC (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 1:25 ratio at 37Ã‚Â°C with continuous agitation at 650 rpm, first for 4 h in 8 M / 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then for 16 h after dilution to 0.9 M urea with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and subsequently filtrated by a Microcon ultrafiltration device with 10 kDa cutoff (Merck-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The filtered peptides were acidified with 0.6 % trifluoroacetic acid to a pH of 2-3, followed by desalting with Stage Tips (Rappsilber J, Ishihama Y, Mann M. Anal Chem. 2003, 75:663-70.). Desalted peptides were vacuum dried, dissolved in 1 % formic acid and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Equal amounts of peptides of each sample were loaded on a nanoflow HPLC system (Easy-nLC1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) coupled to a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) equipped with a nanoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½electrospray ionization source. The peptides were first loaded on a trapping column and subsequently separated inline on a 15 cm C18 column (75 Ã‚Âµm x 15 cm, ReproSil-Pur 5 Ã‚Âµ;m 200 Ãƒâ€¦ C18-AQ, Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile/water (95:5 (v/v)) with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). The peptides were separated with a 60 min gradient from 7 to 35 % of solvent B. Before the end of the run, the percentage of solvent B was raised to 100 % in 2 min and kept there for 8 min. Full MS scan over the mass-to-charge (m/z) range of 300-2000 with a resolution of 140,000 followed by data dependent acquisition of with an isolation window of 2.0 m/z and a dynamic exclusion time of 20 s was performed. The top 10 ions were fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 27 and scanned over the m/z range of 200-2000 with a resolution of 17,500. After the MS2 scan for each of the top 10 ions had been obtained, a new full mass spectrum scan was acquired and the process repeated until the end of the 70-min run. Three repeated runs per sample were performed.

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched using the MaxQuant software (Cox J, Mann M. Nat Biotechnol. 2008, 26:1367-72), version 1.5.2.8,  against a database containing reviewed (SwissProt) mouse sequences, of UniProtKB release 2018_08. Peptide-spectrum-match- and protein-level false discovery rates were set at 0.01. Carbamidomethyl (C), as a fixed modification, and oxidation (M, P, K) as dynamic modifications were included. A maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. The LC-MS profiles were aligned, and the identifications were transferred to non-sequenced or non-identified MS features in other LC-MS runs (matching between runs). The extracted ion intensities of all peptides matching to the same protein from the three technical replicates were summed together.
