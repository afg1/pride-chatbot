### Title
The production of Excretory-Secretory molecules from Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri fourth stage larvae varies between mixed and single sex cultures.

### Description
In this study, the composition of ES of male and female L4 stage Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri in the presence (cultured together) or absence (cultured alone) of the opposite sex was examined using mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
The mice were orally infected with 300 infective larvae (L3) H. polygyrus bakeri, then sacrificed six days after infection. The larvae were collected and then immediately used for ES preparation.

### Data Protocol
The acquired MS/MS data were preprocessed with Mascot Distiller software and a search was performed with the Mascot Search Engine. The significance threshold was set at p<0.01.
