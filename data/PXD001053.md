### Title
Rescue of disrupted mechanotransduction as a new therapeutic strategy in human dilated cardiomyopathy

### Description
Determine proteins interacting with ILK in transgenic mouse heart tissue.

### Sample Protocol
Mouse heart harvested, tissue processed, immunoprecipitation with anti-ILK antibody, proteolytic digestion of immunopt

### Data Protocol
All peaks analyzed, Scaffold3 software analysis of resulting MS peaks</br></br>RAW files 1-15 respresent original, unprocessed data from the Thermo Scientific Xcalibur software after collection on the Thermo LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Each file represents excised differential bands bebetween ILK and control immunoprecipitations. Identified protein:protein interactions that were deemed biologically interesting were verified using cell- and tissue-based analysis.
