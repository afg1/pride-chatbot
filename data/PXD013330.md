### Title
In-depth proteomic analysis of nasal secretions from chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps

### Description
Considering the complex and multifarious features of Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) including immunologic patterns, novel modalities are needed to reflect clinical and pathophysiological endotypes beyond nasal polyps.We aimed to investigate the proteome of nasal secretions on filter paper from CRS patients to characterize endotypes.

### Sample Protocol
Nasal secretions were collected from both sides of the nose using sterilized small strip of filter paper. A 100 �뿙L aliquot of each nasal secretion sample was prepared as described below. First, the samples were centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 4占쎄샷, 10 min) to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by tryptophan fluorescence emission at 350 nm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The samples were stored at -80吏퇒 for further proteomics experiments. After 50 ul of proteins was precipitated overnight at -20吏퇒 using ice-cold acetone, protein digestion was performed via the 2-step FASP procedure as described with some modifications. All LC-MS/MS analysis including DDA methods was performed using Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometers, Q-exactive plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC systems (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) via a nano electrospray source

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were processed in Maxquant 1.5.3.1. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Human Uniprot protein sequence database (December 2014, 88,657 entries). using the Andromeda search engine. Primary searches were performed using a 6-ppm precursor ion tolerance for total protein level analysis. The MS/MS ion tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Cysteine carbamido-methylation was set as a fixed modification. N-acetylation of protein and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set to full tryptic digestion. Peptides with a minimum length of six amino-acids and up to two missed-cleavages were considered. The required false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% at the peptide, protein, and modification level.
