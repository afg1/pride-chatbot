### Title
Whole-cell proteomics of emetic Bacillus cereus in groundwater

### Description
This project contributes to the proteomic comparison of one asporogenic variant of emetic Bacillus cereus and its parental strain grown in groundwater and harvested after 24 and 72h incubation.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel, subjected to electrophoresis, sliced into polyacrylamide bands, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared using R package DEP.
