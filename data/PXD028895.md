### Title
Urine Proteomics for Noninvasive Monitoring of Biomarkers in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

### Description
Current techniques to diagnose and/or monitor critically ill neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) require invasive sampling of body fluids, which can affect the health status of these frail neonate. We tested our hypotheses 1)  it is feasible to use early urine samples from extremely low gestational age newborns at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia for proteomics, and 2) urine proteomics can confirm previously identified proteins and biomarkers associated with BPD without invasive sample collection.   We developed a robust high throughput urine proteomics methodology that requires only 50 microliters of urine. We validated the methodology on urine collected within 72 hours of birth. Urine samples were collected from extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANS) (gestational age (26 + 1.2) weeks) admitted to a single Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU); half of whom eventually developed BPD, while the other half served as controls.  Our high throughput urine proteomics approach clearly identified several BPD-associated changes in the urine proteome recapitulating expected blood proteome changes. Interestingly, sixteen identified urinary proteins are known targets of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   Urine proteomics can be used for prediction of BPD risk. In addition to identifying numerous proteins implicated in BPD pathophysiology, previously found in invasively collected blood, tracheal aspirate, and broncho-alveolar lavage, urine proteomics also suggested novel potential therapeutic targets. Ease of access to urine for sequential proteomic evaluations could also allow for longitudinal monitoring of disease progression and impact of therapeutic intervention.

### Sample Protocol
MStern Blotting: The widely accepted “MStern Blotting” approach was used to process all urine samples Berger ST, Ahmed S, Muntel J, Cuevas Polo N, Bachur R, Kentsis A, et al.

### Data Protocol
Mass Spectrometric Analysis Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA). A total of 42 urine samples, case (21) and control (21) first point urine biomarker samples were analyzed using a data-dependent TOP10 acquisition method by initial liquid chromatography separation by using a microfluidic chip system (Eksigent, trapping column : 200 μm x 0.5 mm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm ; analytical column: 75 μm x 15 cm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm) followed by DDA analysis on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Data Independent Acquisition (DIA). A total of 42 urine samples, case (21) and control (21) first point urine biomarker samples were analyzed using a MS DIA acquisition method by initial liquid chromatography separation by using a microfluidic chip system (Eksigent, trapping column: 200 μm x 0.5 mm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm; analytical column: 75 μm x 15 cm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm) followed by DIA analysis on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Spectral Library Construction. All DDA .raw files were directly processed with MaxQuant v 1.6.0.1 using Uniprot Human reference proteome with iRT peptide sequence added (Biognosys) DIA Data Analysis. All DIA data was analyzed directly in Spectronaut Pulsar v13.0 (Biognosys).
