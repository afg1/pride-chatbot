### Title
Quantitative comparison of E.huxleyi proteome in C-cell, N-cell, and over the diel cycle

### Description
Quantitatve, isobaric labelling based, proteomics was used to study changes in the whole cell E. huxleyi proteome over a 24 hour cycle, and comparing C-cells with N-cells.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were disrupted by sonnication, proteins digested using a FASP procedure and samples were TMT labeled before mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using the Philosopher / TMT-integrator pipeline.
