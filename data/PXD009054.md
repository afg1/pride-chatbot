### Title
MitoTAILS: N-terminomics profiling of mitochondrial proteolysis

### Description
Mitochandria were isolated from SILAC labeled HeLa cells, either naive or under early apoptosis-inducing conditions. Early proteolytic events were evaluated by enriching for N-terminal peptides through N-TAILS.

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cells were grown in SILAC media and exposed to DMSO, BAM7 or staurosporin. Cells were collected and mitochondria enriched. Cells were mixed 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on the experiment and the mitochondrial proteome was blocked by reductive alkylation before tryptic digestion and removal of internal tryptic peptides using an aldehyde-functionalized HPG polymer, After desalting the N-terminal peptides were analyzed by nanoLC-Q-TOF (Bruker Impact II) analysis in duplicate.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant version 1.5.2.8 using standard settings. Spectra were matched against a human Uniprot database (Oct 2013) using the "revert" option for False discovery rate (FDR) calculation. FDR was set to 0.01 for protein and PSM level identification.Incorporated heavy arginine (+6 and/or +10) was used for relative quantification between samples. TAILS samples, and shotgun-like preTAILS samples prior to depletion were analyzed separately.
