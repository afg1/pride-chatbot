### Title
DIA/SWATH of the whole cell proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

### Description
Untargeted DIA/SWATH of the whole cell proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CRISPRi mutants

### Sample Protocol
Mvcobacterium tuberculosis CRISPRi mutants were grown and cells harvested. Whole cell lysis was performed, followed by FASP, where proteins were reduced, alkylated, trypsin digested, and finally peptides were desalted by C18 Ziptip. SWATH measurements were performed by LC-MS/MS on SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification using DIA-NN searched against Uniprt reference proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis h37Rv (UP000001584). SWATH data processed using Peakview 2.1.
