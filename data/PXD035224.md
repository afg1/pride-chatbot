### Title
Unraveling the Bombus terrestris hemolymph, a readout of the immune response to microbial infections, through complementary mass spectrometry approaches

### Description
Pollinators are of crucial importance for maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems and for agriculture, including the Buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The health decline in these populations is thought to be linked to various abiotic and biotic stressors. In the hope of protecting these populations, deciphering their immune response in stress conditions represent a critical issue. To assess this metric, we analysed the bumblebee hemolymph, as a readout of the immune status. Here, we show in laboratory conditions that bacterial infections with two entomopathogenic strains and a well-recognised inducer of defence reactions in insects, impact the systemic immune response. Analysis of the hemolymph was carried out using a two-stage approach of mass spectrometry that combines MALDI molecular mass fingerprinting (MALDI MFP or MALDI-BeeTyping®) for its effectiveness in assessing the immune status of the bumblebee through a basic “blood” test and LC-ESI-MS/MS to measure the impact of our infectious models on the “haemoproteome”. By carrying out three different types of bacterial infections, we found that the bumblebee reacts in a specific way to bacterial attacks. Indeed, bacteria impact mortality and stimulate an immune response in infected individuals that is visible through changes in the molecular composition of their hemolymph. The characterisation and label-free quantification of proteins involved in specific signalling pathways in bumblebees by LC-ESI-MS/MS revealed differences in the protein expression between the non-experimentally infected and the infected bumblebees. Our results highlights differences in the molecular composition of their hemolymph to distinguish these different infections from non-experimentally infected bumblebees, and an alteration of pathways involved in (i) immunity and defences, (ii) the metabolism of carbohydrates (glycolysis), (iii) oxidative stress and (iv) amino acid biosynthesis. To conclude, we established bioinformatics models based on molecular markers reflecting the health status of these pollinators to enable diagnosis/prognosis at the population level in response to environmental stress.

### Sample Protocol
Bacterial strains used for the experimental infections To generate biological models of infection, the two entomopathogenic Gram-negative strains Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 15 (formerly Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 CFBP2141, generous gift from Bruno Lemaitre, EPFL Switzerland) and Serratia marcescens (SmBIOP160412, from our own collection), were used. SmBIOP160412 is an isolate from the haemocoel of a naturally infected Apis mellifera collected in the field. We also challenged bumblebees with the Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698), an opportunistic pathogen spread in nature. Bacteria were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium overnight at 32°C. Bumblebee, infection experiments and hemolymph collection Bumblebee colonies Three Bombus terrestris colonies were obtained by HELIOGREEN SAS (Fillinges, France). Bombus spp. are considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), with Apis mellifera and solitary bees as key model organism on the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees (EFSA Journal 2013;11(7):3295). These workers were placed under artificial conditions, maintained at room temperature (24°C) and continuously in the dark. Bacterial infections Experimental infections were performed according to the procure detailed in Arafah et al. (2019) with minor adjustments. Briefly, in this experiment, we used a group of 80 non-experimentally infected individuals as control and three groups of individuals infected with the bacteria, all individuals had approximately the same body size. Infections were performed by pricking the bumblebees individually in the thorax at the anterior lateral level under the wing with a fine needle (Fine Science Tools, Germany) dipped into a concentrated pellet of live bacteria. Thirty six individuals were infected with M. luteus, 36 with P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and 45 with S. marcescens. All bumblebees (experimentally infected and controls) were placed for 24h at room temperature in small cages and fed ad libitum with sugar syrup (Invertbee from SARL Isnard, France). Hemolymph collection Hemolymph was collected from the dorsal side of the abdomen, using pulled glass capillaries (Sutter Instrument Corp, Novato, California) following the procedure reported in Arafah et al. (2019). After collection, the hemolymph was immediately transferred into a chilled LoBind Protein microtube (Eppendorf, Germany) pre-coated with phenylthiourea (PTU) and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) to prevent melanization and proteolysis, respectively. The hemolymph samples were frozen and stored at -20°C. Bottom-up proteomics Before proteomic analysis, only hemolymph samples collected at 24 hours post-infection were grouped into 3 pools of 3 individuals for the control condition and the M. luteus and P. c. c.  infections and into 3 pools of 4 individuals for the S. marcescens infection. The samples were then dried out by centrifugation under vacuum before being analyzed by a Bottom-Up proteomic approach inspired from Houdelet et al (2020). Briefly, hemolymph samples were suspended in 0.1% RapiGest surfactant in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After reduction with DTT at 56 °C for 30 min in the dark and alkylation with 4-VP at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, samples were digested overnight at 37 °C with 0.5 µg of trypsin. Digested samples were acidified with 5 µL of 20% ACN/10% TFA to stop enzymatic digestion. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000g and transferred into inserts for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) autosampler vials for injection. Nano-LC-MS/MS was carried out using an Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC (Thermo Scientific, Germany) to separate the tryptic-digested peptides according to the protocol established by Masson et al (2020). Briefly, the separation was performed on a reversed-phase column (3 µm, 75 μm × 250 mm) Acclaim C18 PepMap 100 from Thermo Fischer Scientific, using a biphasic linear gradient (water/ACN, each supplemented with 0.1 % formic acid) from 2% to 32% ACN in 100 min and from 32% to 65% ACN in 5 min. The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, equipped with a nanospray ion source, was used in positive mode and data-dependent acquisition. The voltage applied to the nanotips was adjusted to produce 0.3 μA and the entrance capillary was maintained at 320°C. The Q-Exactive Orbitrap acquired a full-range scan from 380 to 2000 m/z (70,000 resolution, automatic gain control (AGC) target 3 × 106, maximum ion trap time (IT) 200 ms) and then fragmented the top ten-peptide ions in each cycle (17,500 resolution, AGC target 2 × 105, maximum IT 100 ms, intensity threshold 4 × 104, excluding charge-unassigned ions, Normalized Collision Energy of 30). Parent ions were excluded from MS/MS for the next 15 s. The software Chromeleon Xpress and Xcalibur 2.2 were used to control the HPLC and the mass spectrometer, respectively.

### Data Protocol
The Sequest HT search algorithm was run by Proteome DiscovererTM 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, GmBH) to match the acquired MS/MS spectra to a database consisting of the protein sequences of the order Hymenoptera (including B. terrestris) and some bee pathogens, downloaded from NCBI and UniProtKB, respectively, on May 7th, 2021. The sequence of common protein contaminants (e.g. human keratins) were also added to this database. The following parameters were used: trypsin digest with two maximum missed cleavages; six and 144 amino acids as minimum and maximum peptide lengths, respectively; a tolerance of 10 ppm/0.02 Da for precursors and fragment ions, respectively; cysteine pyridyl-ethylation was set as a fixed modification; C-terminal protein amidation, methionine and tryptophan oxidation were set as variable modifications. The identification confidence was set at a false discovery rate of 1%. Label-free quantification was performed using the Proteome Discoverer software. Chromatographic alignment by the Minora Feature Detector, was achieved with a maximum retention time shift of 10 min and a mass tolerance of 10 ppm. The precursor ions of unique and razor peptides were used to determine protein abundance, and normalization was performed using the total peptide amount. Statistical significance was determined using an ANOVA (Background-Based) test, and an adjusted p-value was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Protein ratios < 0.5 or > 2 in the different conditions relatively to the not-experimentally-infected controls were considered significantly differentially expressed.

### Publication Abstract
Pollinators, including <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems and for agriculture. Deciphering their immune response under stress conditions is a key issue for protecting these populations. To assess this metric, we analyzed the <i>B. terrestris</i> hemolymph as an indicator of their immune status. Hemolymph analysis was carried out using mass spectrometry, MALDI molecular mass fingerprinting was used for its effectiveness in assessing the immune status, and high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to measure the impact of experimental bacterial infections on the "hemoproteome". By infecting with three different types of bacteria, we observed that <i>B. terrestris</i> reacts in a specific way to bacterial attacks. Indeed, bacteria impact survival and stimulate an immune response in infected individuals, visible through changes in the molecular composition of their hemolymph. The characterization and label-free quantification of proteins involved in specific signaling pathways in bumble bees by bottom-up proteomics revealed differences in protein expression between the non-experimentally infected and the infected bees. Our results highlight the alteration of pathways involved in immune and defense reactions, stress, and energetic metabolism. Lastly, we developed molecular signatures reflecting the health status of <i>B. terrestris</i> to pave the way for diagnosis/prognosis tools in response to environmental stress.
