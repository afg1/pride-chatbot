### Title
Merging full-spectrum and fragment ion intensity predictions from deep learning for high quality spectral libraries

### Description
In this work, we present a deep learning based full-spectrum prediction method and demonstrate the merits of using full-spectrum predicted approaches for library searching. Our proposed model provides flexibility to accommodate post-translational modifications and fills the current gap for long peptide predictions.

### Sample Protocol
Existing experimental data were used and spectral libraries were constructed by SpectraST from predictions.

### Data Protocol
Data is searched by Comet database and spectral library search in SpectraST.

### Publication Abstract
None
