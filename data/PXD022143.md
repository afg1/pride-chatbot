### Title
Versatile regulation of autophagy by the deubiquitinase USP11

### Description
Ubiquitination is a versatile post-translational modification known to regulate autophagy. Here, we show that loss of the deubiquitinase USP11 leads to an increase in the autophagic flux. To investigate the molecular details of how USP11 impacts autophagy, we determined interaction partners of USP11 using an affinity purification-mass spectrometry approach. GFP-tagged, catalytically inactive USP11(C318S) was overexpressed in 293 cells. After 4 hour treatment with Torin 1, an inhibitor of mTOR that induces autophagy, cells were lysed and samples further processed for analysis. Catalytically inactive USP11 was used to increase the chances of capturing both interaction partners and potential substrates. We identified many autophagy-related proteins that co-precipitated with USP11, suggesting that USP11 does not regulate autophagy via a single substrate, but that the observed phenotype is the sum of many interactions, each of which should be independently investigated in more detail. Our work focused on elucidating the regulation of autophagy via the lipid kinase complex PI3KC3 complex I, as one of its components (VPS15) was identified in our USP11 interactome data. PI3KC3 complex I is crucial for initiation of autophagosome formation at the endoplasmatic reticulum. USP11 knockout caused an increase in complex activity, which could explain enhanced autophagy in these cells.

### Sample Protocol
GFP-Trap® IP was performed by seeding 3  105 293 cells in 10 cm cell culture dish, following by transfection 24 h later, and cell collection 24 h after transfection. Transfection was performed using PEI (Polysciences Europe, 23966-2) by mixing the reagent with 200 µl Opti-MEM and plasmids in ratio 3:1. The transfection mix was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and afterwards dropwise added to 293 cells. Cells were lysed on ice in IP buffer (20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 0.5 % Triton-X, Aprotinin 1.5 μM, Leupeptin 100 μM, PMSF 1 mM, 10 mM NaF) for 20 min, spun down, supernatant transferred in a new tube. 10% input was taken, mixed with 4  LDS buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. The remaining sample was incubated with 10 µl prewashed GFP-Trap® beads and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The IP was washed 3  with the IP buffer. After the final IP wash, 20 μl elution buffer (50 mM ABC, 2 % Na-deoxycholate, 5 mM TCEP, 20 mM Chloroacetamide (CAA)) was added directly to the beads and samples were boiled for 10 min at 95 °C. The cooled down samples were incubated with 0.5 μg LysC with shaking at 850 rpm for 3 h at 37 °C. 0.5 μg trypsin in ABC were added and incubated with shaking o/n at 850 rpm at 37 °C. Digested samples were mixed with isopropanol and TFA to stop the digestion and directly loaded on in-house assembled SDB-RPS StageTip. Following 2 wash steps (0.1 % TFA in isopropanol, then 0.1 % TFA in water), peptides were eluted (5 % Ammoniumhydroxide in 80 % ACN), dried, and rehydrated in 1 % Formic acid and 2 % ACN, then analyzed on a Q Exactive HF in DDA mode after separation on an easy nLC1200.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and labelfree quantification was performed with MaxQuant 1.6.5, with standard settings and activated LFQ quantification. The Human Swissprot database (September 2017) was used for peptide and protein identification. Proteins with significantly different amount in GFQ-only and GFP-USP11 IP were determined with an FDR 0.05 corrected two-sided T-Test with Perseus 1.6.5.

### Publication Abstract
Autophagy is a major cellular quality control system responsible for the degradation of proteins and organelles in response to stress and damage to maintain homeostasis. Ubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins or regulatory components is important for the precise control of autophagy pathways. Here, we show that the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) restricts autophagy and that KO of USP11 in mammalian cells results in elevated autophagic flux. We also demonstrate that depletion of the USP11 homolog H34C03.2 in Caenorhabditis elegans triggers hyperactivation of autophagy and protects the animals against human amyloid-&#x3b2; peptide 42 aggregation-induced paralysis. USP11 coprecipitated with autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and limited its interaction with nuclear receptor-binding factor 2, thus decreasing lipid kinase activity of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and subsequent recruitment of effectors such as WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting proteins to the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, more WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2 puncta accumulated in USP11 KO cells. In addition, USP11 interacts with and stabilizes the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby further contributing to the regulation of autophagy induction. Taken together, our data suggested that USP11 impinges on the autophagy pathway at multiple sites&#xa0;and that inhibiting USP11 alleviates symptoms of proteotoxicity, which is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases.
