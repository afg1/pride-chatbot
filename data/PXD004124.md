### Title
P falciparum gametocyte proteomes

### Description
The P.falciparum gametocyte proteomes of wild type gametocytes and two clones of Pfg377 depleted gametocytes were obtained for a label free comparative analysis to identify osmiophilic body proteins. Gametocyte samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and processed by MaxQuant for identification and LFQ quantification.

### Sample Protocol
Gametocyte purification for proteomic analysis - Three biological replicates of this experiment were performed. Magnetic purification with CS columns in a MaxiMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to retain and purify the gametocytes from non-infected RBCs. Prior to purification, Giemsa smears were analyzed to measure gametocyte stage synchronicity and sex ratios and control for the absence of asexual parasites or immature gametocytes. Purified parasites were counted using a cell counter chamber, and 2x107 parasites were pelleted and frozen for each sample. Parasites were lysed in 4% SDS in PBS, 4X Laemmli Sample Buffer, and reduced with 50 mM DTT at 95 0C for 5 minutes prior to protein gel electrophoresis. Gametocyte sample preparation for LC-MS/MS Experiments - Gel based fractionation of the proteins prior to tryptic digestion was conducted by gel electrophoresis using 10 % Criterion XT Bis-Tris precast gels (Biorad inc, UK) and XT-MES running buffer pH 6.4. Gels were stained with Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Severn Biotech), and divided into 6 slices per lane. Gel slices were treated with 10 mM DTT and 55 mM  iodoacetamide and digested by trypsin overnight at 37 0C as described previously. Tryptic digests were acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% TFA and purified by STAGE tips.

### Data Protocol
Peptide identification and quantification by MaxQuant - Andromeda search engine integrated in the MaxQuant (Version 1.3.0.5) was used to identify proteins. Peak lists were generated for the top 6 most intense MS peaks in 100 Da windows by MaxQuant prior to the database search. The protein database contained 91,901 protein sequences from P. falciparum (http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/release-27/Pfalciparum3D7/) and human IPI version 3.68 (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IPI/) supplemented with frequently observed contaminants. Andromeda search parameters for protein identification were set to tolerance of 6 ppm for the parental peptide and 0.5 Da for fragmentation spectra and trypsin specificity allowing up to 2 miscleaved sites. Deamination of glutamine, oxidation of methionine, and asparagine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications, carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines was specified as a fixed modification. Minimal required peptide length was specified at 6 amino acids. MaxQuant was used as described (26) to perform internal mass calibration of measured ions and peptide validation by the target decoy approach and to enable the ‘match between run option’ for an elution time window of 2 minutes. Peptides and proteins detected by at least two peptides in one of the samples with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% were accepted. Excluded from validation were proteins identified by site only, external contaminants and reversed proteins. Proteins were quantified by normalized summed peptide intensities computed in MaxQuant with the label free quantification (LFQ) option switched on.

### Publication Abstract
An essential step in the transmission of the malaria parasite to the Anopheles vector is the transformation of the mature gametocytes into gametes in the mosquito gut, where they egress from the erythrocytes and mate to produce a zygote, which matures into a motile ookinete. Osmiophilic bodies are electron dense secretory organelles of the female gametocytes which discharge their contents during gamete formation, suggestive of a role in gamete egress. Only one protein with no functional annotation, Pfg377, is described to specifically reside in osmiophilic bodies in Plasmodium falciparum Importantly, Pfg377 defective gametocytes lack osmiophilic bodies and fail to infect mosquitoes, as confirmed here with newly produced pfg377 disrupted parasites. The unique feature of Pfg377 defective gametocytes of lacking osmiophilic bodies was here exploited to perform comparative, label free, global and affinity proteomics analyses of mutant and wild type gametocytes to identify components of these organelles. Subcellular localization studies with fluorescent reporter gene fusions and specific antibodies revealed an osmiophilic body localization for four out of five candidate gene products analyzed: the proteases PfSUB2 (subtilisin 2) and PfDPAP2 (Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 2), the ortholog of the osmiophilic body component of the rodent malaria gametocytes PbGEST and a previously nonannotated 13 kDa protein. These results establish that osmiophilic bodies and their components are dispensable or marginally contribute (PfDPAP2) to gamete egress. Instead, this work reveals a previously unsuspected role of these organelles in P. falciparum development in the mosquito vector.
