### Title
Acute depletion of the ARID1A subunit of SWI/SNF complexes reveals distinct pathways for EP300 dependent activation and repression of transcription.

### Description
The ARID1A subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex is one of the most frequently mutated tumour suppressors. Here, a degron system is applied to detect rapid loss of chromatin accessibility at thousands of loci that frequently include binding sites for pluripotency transcription factors where ARID1A acts to generate accessible mini domains of nucleosomes.  At a subset of these locations, the histone acetyltransferase EP300 dissociates and histone H3K27 acetylation decreases.  Genes adjacent to these sites are frequently downregulated. Remarkably, dissociation of EP300 in the absence of chromatin changes is linked to rapid transcriptional upregulation. Sites where EP300 exhibits co-repressor activity are enriched for MLL3-4, BRD4 and RNA polymerase. A few genes directly affected by these pathways are associated with cancer and pluripotency pathways that come to dominate the chronic ARID1A phenotype. This suggests a handful of upstream regulators drive adaption and represent new sites for intervention in ARID1A driven diseases.

### Sample Protocol
mESC pellets fresh or snap frozen were used for immunoprecipitation.  2 µg antibody (EP300 – Abcam 14984, ARID1A - HPA005456 Sigma-Aldrich, SMARCA4 – Abcam 110641) was DMP-crosslinked to Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed on ice in buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% C7BzO and protease inhibitors. 750 µg of protein lysate was incubated with crosslinked beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were washed with 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 750 mM NaCl and eluted in 7.5% SDS, 10 mM TCEP, 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8.5 (TEAB). Alkylation was performed for 15 min with 20 mM iodoacetamide at 25°C in the dark and proteins were cleaned up using the SP3 (VWR, Sera‐Mag Speed Beads 1:1, CAT# 09‐981‐121, 09‐981‐123, rinsed with water). SP3 beads mix (20 µg/µl) was added to the immunoprecipitation (1 µg/µl). Sample was acidified to pH 2-3 using 10% formic acid and bound to beads with one volume 100% acetonitrile. Beads were rinsed twice with 70% ethanol followed once by 100% acetonitrile. Elution was performed in 50 mM TEAB and digestion with 1 µg trypsin (Pierce) per sample overnight at 37 °C. SP3 beads were not removed for peptide clean up. Resulting peptides were bound to the SP3 beads by addition of one volume acetonitrile and washed twice with 100% acetonitrile.  After drying, elution was performed using 2% DMSO in water and peptides were vacuum dried.

### Data Protocol
The data were processed using MaxQuant (v.1.5.0.25). The t-test differences between means for protein abundance of cells with and without ARID1A depletion were calculated using LFQ intensities and plotted versus log10 P values determined by two-tailed t-test (Perseus Software, v.1.6.1.3). Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
