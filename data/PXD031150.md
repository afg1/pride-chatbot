### Title
Epitope fine mapping by mass spectrometry: Investigations of immune complexes consisting of monoclonal anti-HpTGEKP antibody and zinc finger protein linker phospho-hexapeptides.

### Description
We describe the mass spectrometric analysis of the binding strength of a monoclonal mouse antibody (clone 18E9.D9, BioLegend, London, England)  which was raised against the predominantly occuring phosphorylated linker sequence, HpTGEKP, of C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZNF proteins) using  a synthetic phospho-hexapeptide as epitope peptide. The epitope peptide resembles the sequence motive which occurs with highest frequency  in all C2H2 zinc finger proteins. As this anti-HpTGEKP antibody is assumed to bind to various related phosphorylated C2H2 ZNF protein linker  sequences as well, related phospho-peptide sequences were investigated for binding strength differences. To select the top ten phosphorylated  linker sequence motives of all human C2H2 ZNF proteins, all potential C2H2 ZNF gene linker sequences were extracted from the Human Genome Reference  Consortium database (Build 38, patch release 13). DNA sequence stretches with stop-codons were removed and the DNA codons from the remaining  sequences were translated. The resulting amino acid sequences of all C2H2 ZNF protein linkers were ranked according to their frequencies of occurrence.  From these top ten C2H2 ZNF protein linker sequences the respective phospho-hexapeptides were synthesized and their binding behaviors towards the anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody were investigated by "Intact Transmission Epitope Mapping â€“ Thermodynamic Weak-force Order (ITEM-TWO)".

### Sample Protocol
The anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody was rebuffered into 200 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.7, using centrifugal filters with a molecular mass cut-off of 50 kDa. Afterwards, the anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody concentration was measured to be between 0.52 and 0.63 ug/ul using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer assay. Phospho-hexapeptides HpTGEKP (P01), HpTGERP (P02), HpSGEKP (P03), HpTHTHT (P04), HpTGKKP (P05), HpSGERP (P06), HpTGEKL (P07), HpTGEKS (P08), HpTEEKP (P09), HpTREKP (P10), and non-phosphorylated hexapeptide HTGEKP (P00) were synthesized and the obtained powders (peptides and elephants) were dissolved in 200 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.7, to receive peptide concentrations between 31.49 and 35.71 pmol/ul. Peptide solutions were mixed with antibody solutions to molar ratios of approximately 3:1, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h. NanoESI capillary needles were produced manually and was filled, using one microloader pipette tip,  with 3 ul of the above described solutions. The anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody formed immune complexes in an orthodox binding mode with phospho-hexapeptides P01, P02, P05, P06, P07, P09 and P10. P00 did not bind to the anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody and peptides P03, P04, and P08 only bound unorthodox. ITEM-TWO measurements were performed with the solutions which contained immune complexes with orthodox binding phospho-peptides using a Synapt G2S. Settings: capillary voltage, 1.8 kV; source temperature, 50 C; sample cone voltage, 130 V; source off-set voltage, 130 V; nano flow gas, 0.05 bar; trap collision cell voltage difference, 0 V and higher (scan number protocols below); trap gas flow (Argon), 8 mL/min; transfer collision cell voltage difference, 2 V. Mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode using a mass window of m/z 300 or 400-8000. The quadrupole analyzer was applied to block transmission of lower molecular mass ions: M1 = 4800 with dwell time of 25% and ramp time of 25%; M2 = 5000 with dwell time of 25% and ramp time of 25%; M3 = 5200. The respective immune complexes with orthodox binding phospho-peptides were dissociated in the first collision cell (TRAP). For every immune complex plus free antibody and free peptide mixtures two datasets were recorded, except for the experiment with phospho-peptide 02 for which only one measurement series had been recorded.

### Data Protocol
Prior to determining the intensities of unbound peptide ions in the low mass range of the nano ESI mass spectra smoothing in 5 cycles with a window of 3 was done using the Savitzky-Golay method. Similarly, smoothing was done in 20 cycles with a window of 10 prior to determining the anti-HpTGEKP phospho-peptide antibody ion intensities and/or its respective immune complex ions in the high mass range from the same mass spectrum of the same measurement. The intensities of the ion signals (in arbitrary units) were extracted from the mass spectra of all the applied collision cell voltage differences individually (see scan number protocols above) using MassLynx version 4.1. Ion intensities were plotted against their respective charge states and a Gaussian curve was fitted using Origin Pro 2016G (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA). Intensities for each molecular species or immune complex were obtained from the heights of apices of the Gaussian curves which also marked their average charge states. The apparent thermodynamic and apparent kinetic gas phase complex properties were calculated from normalized ion abundances.

### Publication Abstract
Accurate formation of antibody-antigen complexes has been relied on in both, multitudes of scientific projects and ample therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Mass spectrometrically determined dissociation behavior of immune complexes with the anti-HpTGEKP antibody revealed that the ten most frequently occurring phospho-hexapeptide linker sequences from C2H2 zinc finger proteins could be divided into two classes: orthodox binders, where strong noncovalent interactions developed as anticipated, and unorthodox binders with deviating structures and weaker binding. Phosphorylation of threonine was compulsory for antibody binding in an orthodox manner. Gas phase dissociation energy determinations of seven C2H2 zinc finger protein linker phospho-hexapeptides with orthodox binding properties revealed a bipolar binding motif of the antibody paratope. Epitope peptides, which in addition to the negatively charged phospho-threonine residue were C-terminally flanked by positively charged residues provided stronger binding, i.&#x2009;e. dissociation was endothermic, than peptides with acidic amino acid residues at these positions, for which dissociation was exothermic.
