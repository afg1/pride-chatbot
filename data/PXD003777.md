### Title
Human Platelet PIP3 Signalosome

### Description
Platelets are small, anucleate cells that play an essential role in haemostasis, but can contribute critically to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.  Platelets express all four Class I Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms, with previous work revealing important roles for these enzymes in regulating platelet priming, activation and stable thrombus formation.  Despite this, detailed mechanistic understanding of how these lipid kinases orchestrate these roles in platelets is limited. Class I PI3Ks predominantly regulate cell function through their catalytic product, the signalling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which coordinates the localisation and/or activity of a diverse range of binding proteins.  The complete repertoire of these Class I PI3K effectors in platelets remains unknown, hampering current understanding of Class I PI3K-mediated regulation of platelet function. We therefore conducted a global, unbiased screen for PIP3-binding proteins in human platelets using affinity capture coupled to high resolution proteomic mass spectrometry.  Thus, we present the first in depth analysis of the PIP3 signalosome of human platelets, revealing an extensive PIP3 interactome, including many proteins previously uncharacterised in this cell type.  This work provides important new insights into how Class I PI3K shapes human platelet function.

### Sample Protocol
Platelets were isolated from the blood of three independent healthy human donors, lysed, and subjected to affinity capture of PIP3-binding proteins using PIP3-coupled beads (Echelon).  Control pull downs were conducted using unlabelled beads, and with PIP3 beads following preincubation of the platelet lysates with competing free PIP3.  Pull down eluates were fractionated by gel walking and each gel slice subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion using a DigestPro automated digestion unit (Intavis Ltd).  The resulting peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).  In brief, peptides in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7  gradient segments (1-6% solvent B over 1min., 6-15% B over 58min., 15-32%B over 58min., 32-40%B over 5min., 40-90%B over 1min., held at 90%B for 6min and then reduced to 1%B over 1min.) with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1.  Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.  Peptides were ionized by nano-electrospray ionization at 2.2 kV using a stainless steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 μm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250°C.  All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.0 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode.  FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 000 over a scan range (m/z) of 350-1550, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 400 000 and a max injection time of 100ms. The Data Dependent mode was set to TopSpeed and the most intense ions were selected for MS/MS.  Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge states 2-7) and with monoisotopic precursor selection. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (40s +/-10ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 1.6m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 5000, max injection time of 50ms and HCD collision energy of 35%.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v1.4 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the Swissprot Human database using the SEQUEST algorithm.  Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6Da.  Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (+79.966Da) as variable modifications.  Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of 1 missed cleavage was allowed.  The reverse database search option was enabled and all peptide data was filtered to satisfy false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.

### Publication Abstract
The class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms play important roles in platelet priming, activation, and stable thrombus formation. Class I PI3Ks predominantly regulate cell function through their catalytic product, the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>], which coordinates the localization and/or activity of a diverse range of binding proteins. Notably, the complete repertoire of these class I PI3K effectors in platelets remains unknown, limiting mechanistic understanding of class I PI3K-mediated control of platelet function. We measured robust agonist-driven PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> generation in human platelets by lipidomic mass spectrometry (MS), and then used affinity-capture coupled to high-resolution proteomic MS to identify the targets of PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in these cells. We reveal for the first time a diverse platelet PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> interactome, including kinases, signaling adaptors, and regulators of small GTPases, many of which are previously uncharacterized in this cell type. Of these, we show dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides (DAPP1) to be regulated by Src-family kinases and PI3K, while platelets from DAPP1-deficient mice display enhanced thrombus formation on collagen in vitro. This was associated with enhanced platelet &#x3b1;/&#x3b4; granule secretion and &#x3b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activation downstream of the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI. Thus, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> signalosome of human platelets and identify DAPP1 as a novel negative regulator of platelet function. This work provides important new insights into how class I PI3Ks shape platelet function.
