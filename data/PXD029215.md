### Title
LC-MS of FLAG-tagged C-terminal domain of human DUX4

### Description
DUX4 activates the first wave of zygotic gene expression in the early embryo. Mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), whereas expression in cancers suppresses IFNg-induction of MHC Class I and contributes to immune evasion. We show that the DUX4 protein broadly suppresses immune signaling pathwaysâ€”including IFNg, IFNb, DDX58, IFIH1 and cGAS mediated pathways. A conserved region containing (L)LxxL(L) motifs in the DUX4 carboxyterminal domain (CTD) was necessary to suppress interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Co-immunoprecipitation identified DUX4-CTD interaction with multiple immune signaling factors, including STAT1. The DUX4-CTD (L)LxxL(L) region interacts with phosphorylated STAT1, sequesters it in the nucleus, modestly reduces its DNA binding, and prevents STAT1 from inducing ISG transcription. Mouse Dux similarly interacted with STAT1 and suppressed IFNg induction of ISGs. These findings identify an evolved role of the DUXC family in modulating immune signaling pathways with implications for development, cancers, and FSHD.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were immunoprecipitated using beads cross-linked to anti-FLAG antibodies and then competitively eluted with FLAG peptide. Protein samples were eluted and then electrophoresed on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel. Gel bands were then excised, reduced, alkylated, digested with trypsin, desalted, then subjected to LC-MS on the Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Results were filtered to only include protein identifications from high confidence peptides with a 1% false discovery rate. Proteins that were identified in at least one sample from both independent experiments with at least 2 PSMs in one sample were assigned to one of ten categories: 1, candidates; 2, cytoskeletal associated; 3, cytoskeletal; 4, ribosome/translation associated; 5, proteasome associated; 6, membrane or extracellular; ER, Golgi, or vesicle associated; 8, lipid metabolism; 9, chaperones; 10, nuclear import or nuclear membrane associated.
