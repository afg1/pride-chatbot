### Title
Analysis of proteome and phosphoproteome of mice kidney with deletion of renal tubular Raptor as compared to control animals

### Description
Raptor expression was specifically deleted in the tubular system of the kidney using an inducible Cre-Lox system under the control of a Pax8 promotor. Please see further details concerning the experimental procedures in the accompanied publication

### Sample Protocol
Snap-frozen kidney cortices of "Raptor-delta-tubule" kidneys and control kidneys were solublized in 8M urea with protease inhibitor, homogenized using a glass homogenizer, and subjected to tryptic digestion. 95% of the sample was subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment, and 5% to whole proteome measurements. All samples were cleaned up using Stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Data were processed using MaxQuant v1.5. Data were analyzed using Perseus v 1.5.
