### Title
Quantitative proteomic analyses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reveals differentially expressed proteins in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls

### Description
We characterize the proteome from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells  form multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and from healthy controls (K) by  mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics for biomarker discovery.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were lysed in 100 l 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.6 containing 4% SDS. Samples of proteins were prepared to mass spectrometry analysis by using  filter aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol.  After sample cleanup performed using OasisR HLB μElution Plate, tryptic peptides were applied on Orbitrap Elite.

### Data Protocol
MS raw files were analyzed by the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.6.0), and peak lists were searched against the human SwissProt FASTA database (version May 2017), and a common contaminants database by the Andromeda search engine. False discovery rate was set to 0.01 for proteins and peptides (minimum length of six amino acids) and was determined by searching a reverse database. Trypsin was set as digestion protease, and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed in the database search. Peptide identification was performed with an allowed MS mass deviation tolerance of 20 ppm, and MS/MS fragment ions could deviate by up to 0.5 Da. methionine oxidation was used and as fixed modification cysteine carbamidomethylation.
