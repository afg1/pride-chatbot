### Title
Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli infection causes infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes of chick tracheal by the complement and coagulation cascades pathway

### Description
Tracheal mucosal epithelial cells were scraped at 12 and 24 hours of infection, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The cells were sent to a biotechnology company for TMT quantitative proteomic analysis. The cells were sent to a biotech company for TMT quantitative proteomics analysis.
