### Title
Purified Smc5/6 complex exhibits DNA substrate recognition and compaction

### Description
Investigation into the topology and fucntion of the yeast SMC5/6 complex

### Sample Protocol
For crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis, 130µg of Smc5/6 complex were was crosslinked using a 1:600 molar ratio of protein to BS3 BS3 as described above. Quenching was achieved by addition of 50mM Ammonium Bicarbonate and incubation for 30min at room temperature. Raction producs were separated by SDS PAGE. The gel band corresponding to the cross-linked species was excised and digested with trypsin (Pierce, Germany). The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted and desalted using C18 StageTips. Eluted peptides were fractionated on an ÄKTA Pure system (GE Healthcare) using a Superdex Peptide 3.2/300 (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min using 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase. Five 50 µl fractions were collected and dried. Samples for analysis were resuspended in 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid 1.6 % (v/v) acetonitrile. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted in duplicate for SEC fractions and triplicate for SCX fractions, performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled on-line with an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The sample was separated and ionized by a 50 cm EASY-Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid and mobile phase B of 80 % (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid. Flow-rate of 0.3 μL/min using gradients optimized for each chromatographic fraction from offline fractionation ranging from 2 % mobile phase B to 45 % mobile phase B over 90 min. The MS data was acquired in data-dependent mode using the top-speed setting with a three second cycle time. For every cycle, the full scan mass spectrum was recorded in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 in the range of 400 to 1,600 m/z. Ions with a precursor charge state between 3+ and 6+ were isolated and fragmented. Fragmentation by Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) employed a decision tree logic with optimized collision energies. The fragmentation spectra were then recorded in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with single repeat count and 60-second exclusion duration.

### Data Protocol
A recalibration of the precursor m/z was conducted based on high-confidence (<1% false discovery rate (FDR)) linear peptide identifications [REF]. The recalibrated peak lists were searched against the sequences and the reversed sequences (as decoys) of crosslinked peptides using the Xi software suite (v.1.6.745) for identification. The following parameters were applied for the search: MS1 accuracy = 3 ppm; MS2 accuracy = 10 ppm; enzyme = trypsin (with full tryptic specificity) allowing up to three missed cleavages; crosslinker = BS3 with an assumed reaction specificity for lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine and protein N termini; fixed modifications = carbamidomethylation on cysteine; variable modifications = oxidation on methionine, hydrolyzed/aminolyzed BS3 from reaction with ammonia or water on a free crosslinker end. The identified candidates were filtered to 2% FDR on link level using XiFDR v.1.1.26.58.

### Publication Abstract
Eukaryotic SMC complexes, cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6, use ATP hydrolysis to power a plethora of functions requiring organization and restructuring of eukaryotic chromosomes in interphase and during mitosis. The Smc5/6 mechanism of action and its activity on DNA are largely unknown. Here we purified the budding yeast Smc5/6 holocomplex and characterized its core biochemical and biophysical activities. Purified Smc5/6 exhibits DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and SUMO E3 ligase activity. We show that Smc5/6 binds DNA topologically with affinity for supercoiled and catenated DNA templates. Employing single-molecule assays to analyze the functional and dynamic characteristics of Smc5/6 bound to DNA, we show that Smc5/6 locks DNA plectonemes and can compact DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex recognizes DNA tertiary structures involving juxtaposed helices and might modulate DNA topology by plectoneme stabilization and local compaction.
