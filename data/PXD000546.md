### Title
Deciphering thylakoid microdomains using a mass spectrometry-based approach

### Description
In photosynthetic eukaryotes, photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, and more specifically in the thylakoid membranes. The thylakoids consist of two main domains: the grana, which are piles of membranes gathered together by stacking forces, and the stroma-lamellae, which are unstacked thylakoids connecting the grana. The major photosynthetic complexes are unevenly distributed, within these compartments, due to steric and electrostatic constraints and to their role in the photosynthetic process. To gain information on the sub-thylakoid distribution of these proteins (i.e. in the grana and in the stroma-lamellae) we combined experimental approaches to perform a complete survey of the protein composition of these thylakoid sub-compartments using i) thylakoid membrane fractionations to improve the dynamic range detection of minor thylakoid proteins and ii) a quantitative proteomic approach coupled to a dedicated data analysis pipeline and manual annotation to differentiate genuine grana and stroma-lamellae proteins from possible contaminants. Besides confirming previous information on the localization of photosynthetic proteins, these experiments provide some unexpected results, and allow revisiting the composition of the thylakoid micro-domains.

### Sample Protocol
Thylakoid fractions were run as biological replicates and technical duplicates. The dried extracted peptides were resuspended in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and analysed by online nanoLC-MS/MS (Ultimate 3000, Dionex and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Peptides were sampled on a 300 µm x 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn and separated on a 75 µm x 250 mm C18 column (PepMap, Dionex). The nanoLC method consisted in a 120-minutes gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, ranging from 5% (v/v) to 37% (v/v) acetronitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid during 114 min before reaching 72% (v/v) for the last 6 minutes. MS and MS/MS data were acquired using Xcalibur V2.1.0 SP1 (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Spray voltage and heated capillary were respectively set at 1.4 kV and 200°C. Survey full-scan MS spectra (m/z = 400–1600) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 after accumulation of 106 ions (maximum filling time: 500 ms). The twenty most intense ions from the preview survey scan delivered by the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (collision energy 35%) in the LTQ after accumulation of 104 ions (maximum filling time: 100 ms).

### Data Protocol
Peak lists were generated with the Mascot Distiller version 2.4.3.3 software (Matrix Science) from the LC-MS/MS raw data. Using the Mascot 2.4.0 search engine (Mascot Daemon, Matrix Science), MS/MS spectra were searched against a compilation of the A. thaliana protein database provided by TAIR (nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid genomes; TAIR version 10; 35,386 entries; http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and a home-made list of contaminants frequently observed in proteomics analyses (260 sequences). Both databases were concatenated with the corresponding decoy database in order to calculate false discovery rate. One missed trypsin cleavage was allowed, and trypsin/P was used as the enzyme (cleavage at the C terminus of Lys/Arg). The mass tolerances were 10 ppm for precursor ions and 1.0 Da for fragment ions. The variable modifications allowed were N-acetylation (protein N termini), methionine oxidation and dioxidation. A fixed modification was set: carbomidomethyl cystein. Mascot search results were automatically filtered using the home-developed IRMa 1.31.1 software (Dupierris et al., 2009). The following parameters were applied: i) the number of report hits was fixed automatically to retrieve proteins with a p value, as defined by Mascot, such as p < 0.05; ii) only peptides ranked first and with an homology threshold such as the p value, as defined by Mascot, corresponding to p < 0.05, were kept. Every duplicated peptide sequence was conserved to calculate spectal counts. Consistent protein grouping for all the analyses (same master protein reported) was ensured using the IRMa software. In order to avoid redundancy, only the master proteins (i.e. the protein representing a protein group) were given in the provided results. For each database search, protein groups were identified with a 1% false discovery rate.

### Publication Abstract
Photosynthesis has shaped atmospheric and ocean chemistries and probably changed the climate as well, as oxygen is released from water as part of the photosynthetic process. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, this process occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle containing the most abundant biological membrane, the thylakoids. The thylakoids of plants and some green algae are structurally inhomogeneous, consisting of two main domains: the grana, which are piles of membranes gathered by stacking forces, and the stroma-lamellae, which are unstacked thylakoids connecting the grana. The major photosynthetic complexes are unevenly distributed within these compartments because of steric and electrostatic constraints. Although proteomic analysis of thylakoids has been instrumental to define its protein components, no extensive proteomic study of subthylakoid localization of proteins in the BBY (grana) and the stroma-lamellae fractions has been achieved so far. To fill this gap, we performed a complete survey of the protein composition of these thylakoid subcompartments using thylakoid membrane fractionations. We employed semiquantitative proteomics coupled with a data analysis pipeline and manual annotation to differentiate genuine BBY and stroma-lamellae proteins from possible contaminants. About 300 thylakoid (or potentially thylakoid) proteins were shown to be enriched in either the BBY or the stroma-lamellae fractions. Overall, present findings corroborate previous observations obtained for photosynthetic proteins that used nonproteomic approaches. The originality of the present proteomic relies in the identification of photosynthetic proteins whose differential distribution in the thylakoid subcompartments might explain already observed phenomenon such as LHCII docking. Besides, from the present localization results we can suggest new molecular actors for photosynthesis-linked activities. For instance, most PsbP-like subunits being differently localized in stroma-lamellae, these proteins could be linked to the PSI-NDH complex in the context of cyclic electron flow around PSI. In addition, we could identify about a hundred new likely minor thylakoid (or chloroplast) proteins, some of them being potential regulators of the chloroplast physiology.
