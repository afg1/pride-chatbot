### Title
Proteomic Analysis on Anti-proliferative and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analogue, 1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one Treated Human Glioblastoma and Neuroblastoma Cells

### Description
A label free shotgun proteomic analysis that defined the protein profiles in neuroblastoma cells.

### Sample Protocol
The dried, desalted peptide samples were reconstituted with 10 µL of 0.1% formic acid prior being analyzed on nano-ESI-QTOF (Agilent, 65000 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS) equipped with Agilent Large Capacity Chip (G4240-62010 300Å-C18) that was equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid (solution A). One microliter of peptide sample was injected and eluted from the column at a flow rate of 500 nL/min with an increasing 5 to 70% of solution B, i.e., acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid for 40 minutes. The polarity was set as positive, the capillary voltage at 1,900 V and fragmenter voltage at 360 V. The drying gas flowed through the column at 325 °C with a flow rate of 5.0 L/min. The spectra were then acquired in auto MS/MS mode in a mass range of 110 to 3,000 (m/z) for MS scan and 50 to 3,000 (m/z) for MS/MS scan. The spectra were then analyzed using PEAKS X software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada).

### Data Protocol
Protein identification in both control and treated samples were performed via automated de novo sequencing using PEAKS X software. The peptide spectra were matched against in silico digested Homo sapiens database downloaded from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/). A mass shift of 57.02 Da (carbamidomethylation), fragment mass tolerance of 0.1 Da, monoisotopic precursor and FDR less than 1.0% were set as the search criterion. Trypsin as the digestion enzyme. LFQ was then performed on PEAKS Q module embedded in PEAKS X software. The mass error tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and retention time shift tolerance was set at 6.0 min. At FDR less than 1.0%, proteins that passed through significance (-10lgP) = 13 or equivalent to a p-value of less than 0.05, with at least 1 unique peptide, and a ratio less than 0.76 or more than 1.3 were selected as query terms for subsequent bioinformatic analysis. The ratio is defined as the protein intensity of treated sample vs. control sample.

### Publication Abstract
Curcumin analogs with excellent biological properties have been synthesized to address and overcome the poor pharmacokinetic profiles of curcumin. This study aims to investigate the cytotoxicity, anti-proliferative, and apoptosis-inducing ability of curcumin analog, MS13 on human glioblastoma U-87 MG, and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and to examine the global proteome changes in these cells following treatment. Our current findings showed that MS13 induced potent cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effects on both cells. Increased caspase-3 activity and decreased bcl-2 concentration upon treatment indicate that MS13 induces apoptosis in these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The label-free shotgun proteomic analysis has defined the protein profiles in both glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cells, whereby a total of nine common DEPs, inclusive of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alpha-enolase (ENO1), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90AB1), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (EFI5A), heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), tubulin beta chain (TUBB), histone H2AX (H2AFX), and Protein SET were identified. Pathway analysis further elucidated that MS13 may induce its anti-tumor effects in both cells via the common enriched pathways, "Glycolysis" and "Post-translational protein modification." Conclusively, MS13 demonstrates an anti-cancer effect that may indicate its potential use in the management of brain malignancies.
