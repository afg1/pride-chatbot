### Title
Time-resolved proteome analysis of Listeria monocytogenes during infection reveals the role of the AAA+ chaperone ClpC for host cell adaptation

### Description
The cellular proteome is the set of expressed proteins at a given time and defines an organism's phenotype under specific conditions. The proteome is shaped and remodeled by both protein synthesis and degradation. In this study, we combined metabolic and chemical isobaric peptide labeling to simultaneously determine protein decay and de novo synthesis of intracellular Listeria monocytogenes, while focusing on the role of the AAA+ chaperone protein ClpC. ClpC associates with the peptidase ClpP to form an ATP-dependent protease complex and has been shown to play a role in virulence development in the human pathogen L. monocytogenes. However, the mechanism by which ClpC is involved in the survival and proliferation of intracellular L.monocytogenes remains elusive. We observed extensive proteome remodeling in L. monocytogenes upon interaction with the host, supporting the hypothesis that ClpC-dependent protein degradation is required to initiate bacterial adaptation mechanisms. We identified more than 100 putative ClpC target proteins through their stabilization in a clpC deletion strain. Beyond the identification of direct targets, we also observed indirect effects of the clpC deletion on the protein abundance in diverse cellular and metabolic pathways, such as iron acquisition and flagellar assembly. Overall, our data highlights the crucial role of ClpC for L. monocytogenes adaptation to the host environment through proteome remodeling.  Importance Survival and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria inside the host depend on their ability to adapt to the changing environment. It is therefore important to profile the underlying changes on the bacterial proteome level during the infection process to understand pathogenesis and host-dependent adaptation processes. The interplay between protein synthesis and decay governs cellular protein abundance. SILAC pulse labeling enables direct readout of these events during infection. Combining this approach with tandem-mass-tag (TMT) labeling enabled multiplexed and time-resolved bacterial proteome quantification during infection. We applied this integrated approach to investigate protein turnover during the temporal progression of bacterial adaptation to the host on a system-wide scale. Our experimental approach can easily be transferred to probe the proteome remodeling in other bacteria under a variety of perturbations.

### Sample Protocol
Caco-2 cells were infected with listeria monocytogenes that had been pre-labeled with heavy lysine in SILAC heavy medium. Samples were taken at 7 time points. Bacteria were recovered from Caco-2 host cells, lysed by bead beating, and processed using SP3 sample preparation. Peptides were labeled with TMTpro 16plex reagents, pooled, and fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography. High pH fractions were concatenated into 8 final samples, desalted and analyzed on a Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. An MS3 method was used for peptide quantification.

### Data Protocol
All raw files were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 2.4 using SEQUEST HT. Peptide-spectrum-matches (PSMs) were filtered to remove contaminants, peptides with inconsistent TMT labelling, peptides with inconsistent SILAC labelling state, peptides derived from the human host cells and peptides with low quality MS3 quantification, accepting a maximum 25% MS1 isolation interference for quantification. The synchronous precursor selection (SPS) identity threshold was set to 50%. PSMs corresponding to the same peptide sequence were aggregated and peptides without a lysine were removed, because they cannot be used to distinguish heavy (pre-existing) and light (newly synthesized) proteins. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide identification was set to 1% in all analyses. Sample loading (SL) normalization was applied to adjust the total intensity of each channel to the average total intensity across all channels. We applied internal reference scaling (IRS) to correct for batch effects originating from combination of data from several TMT sets. The internal standard, consisting of a peptide mixture of each sample, was used to normalize reporter ion intensities of proteins between different TMT experiments. The summed reporter ion measurements of the internal reference for each protein in all experiments were averaged to calculate an individual reference value for each protein. Individual intensity-scale measurements are thereby preserved.  We corrected for compositional bias in the data set using Upper Quartile normalization. Protein half-lifes were determined based on the heavy protein intensities. Statistical significance of differences in protein half-lives and abundances was assessed using a moderated t-test (limma).
