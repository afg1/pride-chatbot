### Title
An impaired respiratory electron chain triggers retrograde response and de-ubiquitination of solute carrier amino acid transporters

### Description
Hundreds of genes have been associated with respiratory chain disease so far. Elimination of the respiratory electron chain by depleting the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, ��0 cells) has therefore one of the most severe impacts on the energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells. Here, we integrated proteomic data sets including the post transcriptional modifications (PTM���s) phosphorylation and ubiquitination, with metabolomic data sets and selected enzyme activities in the osteosarcoma cell line 143B.TK-. We applied a shotgun based SILAC LC-MS proteomics and a targeted metabolomics approach to elucidate the consequences of the ��0 state. Pathway analysis revealed a non-uniform down-regulation of the respiratory electron chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pyruvate metabolism in ��0 cells. Surprisingly, some metabolites of the TCA cycle were dramatically reduced in ��0 cells, like citric acid (100-fold) and aconitic acid (6-fold), others instead increased, like succinic and fumaric acid (5-fold). Enzyme activities were xy. Exceptionally, the mitochondrial retrograde response, a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus, was up-regulated in ��0 cells, like signalling by GPCR, EGFR, G12/13 alpha cAMP and RhoGTPase. We observed a striking de-ubiquitination of 80S ribosomal proteins (3-fold) and SLC amino acid transporters (7-fold) in ��0 cells, the later might cause the observed significant increase of amino acids levels in ��0 cells. We conclude that mtDNA depletion not only leads to an uneven down-regulation of mitochondrial energy pathways, but also to a strong retrograde response. The partly collapsed TCA cycle and de-ubiquitination of SLC transporters lead to an altered amino acid metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
Here, we integrate metabolome and proteome profiles of the parental cell line 143B.TK- versus ��0, including PTM analyses such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. For quantitative proteome profiling, we used the classical SILAC labeling in a shotgun LC-MS approach. For comprehensive metabolome profiling, we applied a targeted LC-MS approach, based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) (16).

### Data Protocol
Further analysis of data was performed using Perseus (v1.5.1.6) a post data acquisition package that is part of MaxQuant. GraphPad Prism 5.03 and RStudio were used for graphing.

### Publication Abstract
Hundreds of genes have been associated with respiratory chain disease (RCD), the most common inborn error of metabolism so far. Elimination of the respiratory electron chain by depleting the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, &#x3c1;(0) cells) has therefore one of the most severe impacts on the energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells. In this study, proteomic data sets including the post-translational modifications (PTMs) phosphorylation and ubiquitination were integrated with metabolomic data sets and selected enzyme activities in the osteosarcoma cell line 143B.TK(-) A shotgun based SILAC LC-MS proteomics and a targeted metabolomics approach was applied to elucidate the consequences of the &#x3c1;(0) state. Pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed a nonuniform down-regulation of the respiratory electron chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the pyruvate metabolism in &#x3c1;(0) cells. Metabolites of the TCA cycle were dysregulated, such as a reduction of citric acid and cis-aconitic acid (six and 2.5-fold), and an increase of lactic acid, oxalacetic acid (both twofold), and succinic acid (fivefold) in &#x3c1;(0) cells. Signaling pathways such as GPCR, EGFR, G12/13 alpha, and Rho GTPases were up-regulated in &#x3c1;(0) cells, which could be indicative for the mitochondrial retrograde response, a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus. This was supported by our phosphoproteome data, which revealed two main processes, GTPase-related signal transduction and cytoskeleton organization. Furthermore, a general de-ubiquitination in &#x3c1;(0) cells was observed, for example, 80S ribosomal proteins were in average threefold and SLC amino acid transporters fivefold de-ubiquitinated. The latter might cause the observed significant increase of amino acid levels in &#x3c1;(0) cells. We conclude that an elimination of the respiratory electron chain, e.g. mtDNA depletion, not only leads to an uneven down-regulation of mitochondrial energy pathways, but also triggers the retrograde response.
