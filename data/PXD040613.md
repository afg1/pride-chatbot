### Title
S-palmitoylation during retinoic acid induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells

### Description
S-palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues through a thioester bond. S-palmitoylation is highly abundant in neurons, where it plays a fundamental role in neuronal development. In addition, S-palmitoylation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, knowledge of S-palmitoylation in neurodevelopment is limited due to technological challenges in analysing this highly hydrophobic modification of proteins. Here, we use two orthogonal methods, acyl-biotin exchange and lipid metabolic labelling, to identify S-acylated proteins and sites in neuronal cells. We identified 650 S-palmitoylated proteins by both methods, including proteins that are well-known for their role in neuronal differentiation. Importantly, significant changes in the abundance of S-palmitoylated proteins were detected during neuronal differentiation. Overall, the combination of methods described here provides the advantage of cross-validation of the identified S-palmitoylated proteins and should be used further to study S-palmitoylation in the central nervous system to understand physiology and neurodegenerative diseases.

### Sample Protocol
SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated with retinoic acid over a 7-day period. For lipid metabolic labelling, HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells were treated with an alkyne-functionalised fatty acid probe, which is metabolically incorporated. After lysis, probe-modified proteins were ligated by copper-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition to an azide-biotin conjugate followed by streptavidin affinity purification. For acyl-biotin exchange, HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cell lysates were treated with a cysteine-reactive alkylation agent to block all free cysteines. Then, thioesters were selectively hydrolysed by hydroxylamine under neutral conditions. These newly-released thiols were labelled with a cysteine-reactive biotinylation reagent. The biotinylated proteins were enriched with streptavidin. The enriched samples were digested with trypsin overnight and desalted using a C18 stagetip. For total proteome analysis, SH-SY5Y lysates were digested on S-trap columns according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using MaxQuant. Search outputs were analysed and visualised using Perseus, Excel, Graphpad Prism and Adobe illustrator.

### Publication Abstract
<i>S</i>-Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of C14:0-C22:0 fatty acids (mainly C16:0 palmitate) to cysteines via thioester bonds. This lipid modification is highly abundant in neurons, where it plays a role in neuronal development and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The knowledge of <i>S</i>-palmitoylation in neurodevelopment is limited due to technological challenges in analyzing this highly hydrophobic protein modification. Here, we used two orthogonal methods, acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) and lipid metabolic labeling (LML), to identify <i>S</i>-palmitoylated proteins and sites during retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. We identified 2002 putative <i>S</i>-palmitoylated proteins in total, of which 650 were found with both methods. Significant changes in the abundance of <i>S</i>-palmitoylated proteins were detected, in particular for several processes and protein classes that are known to be important for neuronal differentiation, which include proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (RET) signal transduction, SNARE protein-mediated exocytosis, and neural cell adhesion molecules. Overall, <i>S</i>-palmitoylation profiling by employing ABE and LML in parallel during RA-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells revealed a subset of high confidence bona fide <i>S</i>-palmitoylated proteins and suggested an important role for <i>S</i>-palmitoylation in neuronal differentiation.
