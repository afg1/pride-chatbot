### Title
Targeted AURKA degradation: Towards new therapeutic agents for neuroblastoma

### Description
Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a well-established target in neuroblastoma (NB) due to both its catalytic functions during mitosis and its kinase-independent functions, including stabilization of the key oncoprotein MYCN. We present a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of MK-5108-derived PROTACs against AURKA by exploring different linker lengths and exit vectors on the thalidomide moiety. PROTAC SK2188 induces the most potent AURKA degradation (DC50,24h 3.9 nM, Dmax,24h 89%) and shows an excellent binding and degradation selectivity profile. Treatment of NGP neuroblastoma cells with SK2188 induced concomitant MYCN degradation, high replication stress/DNA damage levels and apoptosis. Moreover, SK2188 significantly outperforms the parent inhibitor MK-5108 in a cell proliferation screen and patient-derived organoids. Furthermore, altering the attachment point of the PEG linker to the 5-position of thalidomide allowed us to identify a potent AURKA degrader with a linker as short as 2 PEG units. With this, our SAR-study provides interesting lead structures for further optimization and validation of AURKA degradation as a potential therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma.

### Sample Protocol
ell pellets were homogenized in 200Â Î¼l lysis buffer containing 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50Â mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 8.5. Next, the resulting lysate was transferred to a 96-well PIXUL plate in 100Â Î¼l aliquots and sonicated with a PIXUL Multisample sonicator (Active Motif) for 10Â min with default settings (Pulse 50 cycles, PRF 1Â kHz, Burst Rate 20Â Hz). After centrifugation of the samples for 15Â min at maximum speed at room temperature (RT) to remove insoluble components, the protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) and from each sample 100Â Î¼g of protein was isolated to continue the protocol. Proteins were reduced by addition of 15Â mM dithiothreitol and incubation for 30Â min at 55Â Â°C and then alkylated by addition of 30Â mM iodoacetamide and incubation for 15Â min at RT in the dark. Phosphoric acid was added to a final concentration of 1.2% and subsequently samples were diluted 7-fold with binding buffer containing 90% methanol in 100Â mM TEAB, pH 7.55. The samples were loaded on a 96-well S-Trapâ„¢ plate (Protifi) and a ResolvexÂ® A200 positive pressure workstation (Tecan Group Ltd) was used for semi-automatic processing. After protein binding, the S-trapâ„¢ plate was washed three times with 200Â Î¼l binding buffer. A new deepwell plate was placed below the 96-well S-Trapâ„¢ plate and trypsin (1/100, w/w) was added for digestion overnight at 37Â Â°C. Also using the ResolvexÂ® A200 workstation, peptides were eluted in three times, first with 80Â Î¼l 50Â mM TEAB, then with 80Â Î¼l 0.2% formic acid (FA) in water and finally with 80Â Î¼l 0.2% FA in water/acetonitrile (ACN) (50/50, v/v). Eluted peptides were dried completely by vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were redissolved in loading solvent A (0.1% TFA in water/acetonitrile (ACN) (98:2, v/v)) and desalted on a reversed phase (RP) C18 OMIX tip (Agilent). The tip was first washed 3 times with 100Â Î¼l pre-wash buffer (0.1% TFA in water/ACN (20:80, v/v)) and pre-equilibrated 5 times with 100Â Î¼l of wash buffer (0.1% TFA in water) before the sample was loaded on the tip. After peptide binding, the tip was washed 3 times with 100Â Î¼l of wash buffer and peptides were eluted twice with 100Â Î¼l elution buffer (0.1% TFA in water/ACN (40:60, v/v)). The combined elutions were transferred to HPLC inserts and dried in a vacuum concentrator.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were re-dissolved in 20Â Î¼l loading solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile (ACN) (98:2, v/v)) of which 5Â Î¼l was injected for LC-MS/MS analysis on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system in-line connected to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo). Trapping was performed at 10Â Î¼l/min for 2Â min in loading solvent A on a 5Â mm trapping column (Thermo scientific, 300Â Î¼m internal diameter (I.D.), 5Â Î¼m beads). The peptides were separated on a 250Â mm Aurora Ultimate, 1.7Â Î¼m C18, 75Â Î¼m inner diameter (Ionopticks) kept at a constant temperature of 45Â Â°C. Peptides were eluted by a non-linear gradient starting at 1% MS solvent B reaching 33% MS solvent B (0.1% FA in water/acetonitrile (2:8, v/v)) in 100Â min, 55% MS solvent B (0.1% FA in water/acetonitrile (2:8, v/v)) in 135Â min, 70% MS solvent B in 145Â min followed by a 10-min wash at 70% MS solvent B and re-equilibration with MS solvent A (0.1% FA in water). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-independent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Full-scan MS spectra ranging from 375 to 1500 m/z with a target value of 5E6, a maximum fill time of 50Â ms and a resolution at of 60,000 were followed by 30 quadrupole isolations with a precursor isolation width of 10Â m/z for HCD fragmentation at an NCE of 30% after filling the trap at a target value of 3E6 for maximum injection time of 45Â ms. MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 15,000Â at 200Â m/z in the Orbitrap analyser without multiplexing. The isolation intervals ranging from 400 to 900Â m/z, without overlap were created with the Skyline software tool.
