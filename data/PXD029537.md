### Title
Effects of SHetA2 on SiHa and C-33 A human cervical cancer cell lines

### Description
The objective was to identify how cervical cancer cells respond to treatment with the investigational new agent, Sulfur Heteroartoinoid A2 (SHetA2, NSC 726189) by identify proteins that are detected at significantly different levels in SHetA2-treated compared to untreated control cultures. Triplicate cultures of SiHa and C-33 A human cervical cancer cell lines were treated with 10 micromolar SHetA2 or the same volume of dimethylsulfoxide solvent (untreated controls) for 24 hours. Proteins were extracted from the cultures using M-PER (ThermoFisher).Â 

### Sample Protocol
Protein lysates were digested using filter aided sample preparation and evaluated by LC-MS/MS (Synapt G2S, Waters)

### Data Protocol
Data was analyzed using QIP (Waters). Cysteine carbamethylation was used as a fixed modification and Methionine oxidation as a variable modification.
