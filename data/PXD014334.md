### Title
The oncogenic action of NRF2 depends on de-glycation by Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K)

### Description
The NRF2 transcription factor controls a cell stress program that is implicated in cancer and there is great interest in targeting NRF2 for therapy. We show that NRF2 activity depends on Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) - a kinase that triggers protein de-glycation. In its absence, NRF2 is extensively glycated, unstable, and defective at binding to small MAF proteins and transcriptional activation. Moreover, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma triggered by MYC and Keap1 inactivation depends on FN3K in vivo. N-acetyl cysteine treatment partially rescues the effects of FN3K loss on NRF2 driven tumor phenotypes indicating a key role for NRF2-mediated redox balance. Mass spectrometry reveals that other proteins undergo FN3K-sensitive glycation, including translation factors, heat shock proteins, and histones. How glycation affects their functions remains to be defined. In summary, our study reveals a surprising role for the glycation of cellular proteins and implicates FN3K as targetable modulator of NRF2 activity in cancer.

### Sample Protocol
Huh1 (human):  FN3K proficient and deficient Huh1 human HCC cells were lysed and subjected to phenyl borate affinity purification, which enriches glycated proteins.  Unpurified and PB-purified proteins were separated on 4-12% polyacrylamide gel subjected to LC/MSMS. Mouse:  Nucleic acid free total lysates from Fn3k proficient and deficient MYC/sgKeap1 mHCC  isograft were separated on 4-12% polyacrylamide gel subjected to LC/MSMS.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS/MS .raw files were processed using Mascot and searched for protein identification against the SwissProt protein database. Normalized protein intensities were obtained using Scaffold (4.8.4). Glycated lysines were detected by measuring the increase in m/z ratios corresponding to mass of +162.0528 for fructosamine (early product of glycation) or that of downstream advanced adducts such as  +58.0054 for carboxymethyl lysines (CML) or +72.0211 for carboxyethyl lysines (CEL)(Marotta et al., 2003).
