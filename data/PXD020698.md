### Title
iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of Platycladus orientalis roots

### Description
We performed proteomic analyses of the roots in non-root pruned (control) and root-pruned Platycladus orientalis seedlings at different sampling times.

### Sample Protocol
Healthy Platycladus orientalis seedlings with an approximately uniform height were root pruned, and intact roots with seedlings were considered as control (non-root pruning). Root samples of control and root-pruned seedlings were collected and frozen with liquid nitrogen at three time points, and then performed for proteome analysis using relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology coupled with LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
We performed the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer system in positive ionization mode was for data-dependent acquisition of separation samples: full scan range of 300< m/z <1800 at a resolution of 70,000, 40 ms accumulation time per spectrum, high-energy collisional dissociation spectra at a resolution of 17,500, automatic gain control target for 1e6, and dynamic exclusion duration for 60.0 s. Then, we analyzed these MS/MS spectra obtained by utilizing Mascot embedded in Proteome Discoverer.
