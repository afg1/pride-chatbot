### Title
Human Submandibular Gland cells,secretory proteins,LC-MS/MS

### Description
In this work, Human Submandibular Gland (HSG) cells were treated for 24 hours with 0ng/mL, 2ng/mL, or 4ng/mL TGF-β1, respectively. Then, theirs cell supernatants were collected and prepared. We performed quantitave proteomic anaysis to investigate the changes in protein types and abundances among aforsied three groups. To screen out differentially regulated proteins, we compaired the expression levels of all quantified proteins among these three groups by using a label free quntification method.

### Sample Protocol
Cells receiving TGF-β1 treatment (0, 2, and 4 ng/mL) in serum-free medium were cultured in T75 (cm2) culture flask for 24 hours in octuplicate for each group. The cultural supernatant collected from the same group were mixed and centrifuged to deposit cell debris. The acquired cultural supernatant were concentrated step by step by using 15 mL 10 KD ultrafiltration column (Millipore). Proteins were extracted and digested with sequencing grade trypsin. Each peptide sample underwent triplicate LC-MS/MS runs on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer equipped with an EASY-nanoLC™ 1200 system.

### Data Protocol
All raw files generated above were submitted to Proteome Discover (PD, version 2.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) with label-free quantitation (LFQ) analysis. Human and mouse protein sequence databases that downloaded from UniProt database May, 2019 (http://www.uniprot.org) were serviced for data search.

### Publication Abstract
Aging-related salivary gland degeneration usually causes poor oral health. Periductal fibrosis frequently occurs in the submandibular gland of the elderly. Transforming growth factor &#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1) is the primary driving factor for fibrosis, which exhibits an increase in the fibrotic submandibular gland tissue. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TGF-&#x3b2;1 on the human submandibular gland (HSG) cell secretory function and its influences on aquaporin 5 (AQP5) expressions and distribution. We found that TGF-&#x3b2;1 reduces the protein secretion amount of HSG and leads to the abundance alteration of 151 secretory proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD043185. The majority of HSG secretory proteins (84.11%) could be matched to the human saliva proteome. Meanwhile, TGF-&#x3b2;1 enhances the expression of COL4A2, COL5A1, COL7A1, COL1A1, COL2A1, and &#x3b1;-SMA, hinting that TGF-&#x3b2;1 possesses the potential to drive HSG fibrosis-related events. Besides, TGF-&#x3b2;1 also attenuates the AQP5 expression and its membrane distribution in HSGs. The percentage for TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced AQP5 reduction (52.28%) is much greater than that of the TGF-&#x3b2;1-induced secretory protein concentration reduction (16.53%). Taken together, we concluded that TGF-&#x3b2;1 triggers salivary hypofunction via attenuating protein secretion and AQP5 expression in HSGs, which may be associated with TGF-&#x3b2;1-driven fibrosis events in HSGs.
