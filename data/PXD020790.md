### Title
Global analysis of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation in wheat leaf

### Description
Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) is a novel naturally occurring PTM, which is firstly discovered in histone. The system Khib detection at proteomics level has been performed in various species and tissues for the function and role characterization of Khib in biological activities. However, the Khib study in plant species is relatively less and the plant root, one of the critical plant organ, haven’t been studied. In the present study, the first root tissues lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome analysis was performed in wheat specie with antibody immunoprecipitation affinity and high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

### Sample Protocol
The protein extraction was conducted according to previous report with some modifications20. Briefly, clean wheat root tissues were grinded into powder in a mortar with liquid nitrogen. Then the powder were transfer to a tube and re-suspended in ice cold extraction buffer (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 3μM TSA, 50 mM NAM, 10 mM DTT and 1% protease Inhibitor Cocktail). After and 5 minutes sonication on ice, the extraction buffer was mixed with same volume ice-cold Tris buffer phenol (pH 8.0) and agitated for 15 minutes. After centrifugation at 15000 g for 20 min, transfer the phenolic phase to a new tube and add four volumes of 100 mM ammonium acetate in methanol to the tube and keep the tube at -20°C for 12 hours. Following centrifugation (15 min, 15000 g), the precipitated protein pellet was rinsed three times with ice-cold acetone, vacuum-dried and stored at −80°C.

### Data Protocol
The MaxQuant software with integrated Andromeda search engine (v.1.4.1.2) was used for database searching. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the database of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Uniprot (130,673 sequence, October, 2019) concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as the cleavage enzyme and a maximum of 4 missing cleavages was allowed. The mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine was specified as fixed modification. Variable modification was defined as oxidation on methionine and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation on both lysine and N-terminal of protein. False discovery rate (FDR) thresholds were specified at 1% and the minimum peptide length was set to 7. All of the other parameters were set to default.
