### Title
Human normal and peritumor liver tissues LC-MSMS

### Description
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumorigenesis1. The TME is usually studied in tumor tissue and in relation to tumor progression2,3, which can limit understanding of how the TME is involved in processes associated with initial tumorigenesis as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis after surgery. To describe the underlying mechanisms of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and progression, we propose a new concept, the peritumor microenvironment (PME). We collected normal (all biochemical indicators of liver function, imaging examination and histopathology examination were normal) and peritumor (The liver tissues adjacent to the tumor were approximately 2 cm away from the tumor and were taken from patients with HCC who did not receive tumor radiotherapy, tumor chemotherapy or targeted drug therapy before surgery) to perform a proteomic characterization of the PME in peritumor liver tissues.

### Sample Protocol
Liver tissue was cut into 1mm3 pieces, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged. Then, 8 M urea containing protease inhibitor at a 1∶10 (W/V) ratio was added before sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. The BCA method was used to determine protein concentrations. A filter-aided sample preparation method was used to digest the proteins. A Nanodrop 2000c micro ultraviolet spectrophotometer was used to determine peptide concentrations. Peptides were recovered by heat-drying in a vacuum centrifuge at 45 °C and stored at -80 °C. Peptide fractions were pre-separated using reverse chromatography columns. The peptide fractions were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (FA) aqueous solution and centrifuged. Peptide fractions were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-tandem mass spectrometry (Q-Exactive HF LC-MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
Raw data from mass spectrometry were analyzed against the human UniProt protein sequence database (version 20140922, 20,193 sequences) with MaxQuant software31 (version 1.5.3.8).

### Publication Abstract
Although there are many studies on the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the incidence of diseases, mechanisms are rarely known. We report the mechanism by which signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (stat4) rs7574865 promotes the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the GG genotype at stat4 rs7574865 was a risk genotype, and STAT4 levels in serum and peritumoral tissue from HCC patients with the GG genotype were significantly higher than those found in TT or TG carriers. Furthermore, HCC patients with the GG genotype or elevated STAT4 levels had poor prognoses. In vitro experiments demonstrated that STAT4 silencing promoted apoptosis and inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2 and L02 cells. Proteomic analysis of HCC peritumors identified 273 proteins related to STAT4, of which CYP2E1 activity and FGL2 content exhibited the highest positive correlation. The relationship between CYP2E1 and FGL2 was also confirmed in cyp2e1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and in CYP2E1 inhibitor-treated mice. In conclusion, this study elucidates the mechanism by which the stat4 rs7574865 polymorphism promotes the occurrence and progression of HCC via the Stat4/CYP2E1/FGL2 pathway.
