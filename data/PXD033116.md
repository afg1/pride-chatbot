### Title
Chemoproteomics with a Diaryliodonium Probe in Bacteria

### Description
The alarming increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will soon limit treatment options for even routine infections, especially those caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii. Here, we report a two-pronged approach to identify new vulnerabilities in such pathogens. Staring from diphenyleneiodonium (dPI) salts, which are compounds that have moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, we synthesized a focused heterocyclic library and report a new analogue that has much higher inhibitory potency against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and excellent efficacy in reduction of bacterial burden in a mouse neutropenic thigh infection model. The lead compound was also found to synergize with aminoglycosides, which are routinely used in the treatment of such infections in humans. Further, we synthesized an alkyne containing probe and using gel and mass spectrometry base chemoproteomics platforms, we identified proteins that have redox cofactors as putative targets for this class of compounds. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the modification of proteins is covalent and through a cysteine residue. Together, using complementary chemical biology approaches, new vulnerabilities in Gram-negative pathogens were identified that would help address a burgeoning global problem of AMR.

### Publication Abstract
Finding new therapeutic strategies against Gram-negative pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii is challenging. Starting from diphenyleneiodonium (dPI) salts, which are moderate Gram-positive antibacterials, we synthesized a focused heterocyclic library and found a potent inhibitor of patient-derived multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains that significantly reduced bacterial burden in an animal model of infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), listed as a priority 1 critical pathogen by the World Health Organization. Next, using advanced chemoproteomics platforms and activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), we identified and biochemically validated betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB), an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism and maintenance of osmolarity, as a potential target for this compound. Together, using a new class of heterocyclic iodonium salts, a potent CRAB inhibitor was identified, and our study lays the foundation for the identification of new druggable targets against this critical pathogen. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Discovery of novel antibiotics targeting multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens such as A. baumannii is an urgent, unmet medical need. Our work has highlighted the potential of this unique scaffold to annihilate MDR A. baumannii alone and in combination with amikacin both <i>in vitro</i> and in animals, that too without inducing resistance. Further in depth analysis identified central metabolism to be a putative target. Taken together, these experiments lay down the foundation for effective management of infections caused due to highly MDR pathogens.
