### Title
Toxicity of the main electronic cigarette components, propylene glycol, glycerin and nicotine in Sprague Dawley rats in a 90-day OECD inhalation study complemented with molecular endpoints [RNE DATA]

### Description
The main constituents of electronic cigarette liquids are nicotine, propylene glycol (PG), and vegetable glycerin (VG), together with distilled water and flavors. To assess the toxicity of PG/VG mixtures with and without nicotine as basic components of liquids used in e-cigarettes, a 90-day rat inhalation study according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 413 was conducted. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were nose-only exposed, 6â€‰h/day, 5 days/week to filtered air, or nebulized vehicle (saline), or three concentrations of PG/VG (0.174 mg PG/l + 0.210 mg VG/l; 0.520 mg PG/l + 0.630 mg VG/l; 1.520 mg PG/l + 1.890 mg VG/l) with (test item) and without (reference item) 23 µg nicotine/L. Standard toxicological endpoints were complemented by molecular analyses using transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Compared to vehicle exposure, the tested PG/VG aerosols showed only very limited biological effects with no signs of toxicity, both for the standard toxicological endpoints (e.g., histopathology, clinical chemistry) and the systems toxicological analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics). The addition of nicotine to the PG/VG aerosols (23 Âµg/l) resulted in effects in line with nicotine effects in previous studies. These included up-regulation of xenobiotic enzymes (Cyp1a1 and Fmo3) in the lung and metabolic effects, e.g., reduction in serum lipid concentrations and changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes in the liver. Signs of a generalized stress response to nicotine exposure such as decreased thymus weights were observed; and likely, a subset of the observed metabolic alterations was interlinked with this generalized stress response. Under the conditions of this 90-day SD rat inhalation study, no toxicologically relevant effects of PG/VG aerosols (up to 1.520 mg PG/l + 1.890 mg VG/l) were observed, and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for PG/VG/nicotine was determined to be 438/544/6.7 mg/kg/day. Further the study demonstrated how complementary systems toxicology analyses can reveal, also in the absence of observable adverse effects, subtoxic and adaptive responses to pharmacologically active compounds such as nicotine.

### Sample Protocol
Proteome alterations were assessed by isobaric-tag based quantification using the iTRAQ(R) approach (Titz et al., 2015a). Frozen rat right RNE samples were homogenized and sonicated in tissue lysis buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) in random order and the proteins were precipitated with acetone. Protein precipitates were resuspended in 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 50 Âµg of the suspension was processed using the iTRAQ 8-plex labeling procedure according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the samples in a 1:10 trypsin to protein ratio (w/w) followed by overnight digestion at 37Â°C. The tryptic digested samples were labeled with the reporter-ion tags for the different exposure groups. For this, a single multiplexed iTRAQ set layout was defined that accommodated one sample of each exposure type: each 8-plex labeling set included one sample replicate of each sample type (Sham, vehicle, Low (PG/VG), Med (PG/VG), High (PG/VG), Nicotine + Low (PG/VG), Nicotine + Med (PG/VG), and Nicotine + High (PG/VG)). For each of the six replicate sets one sample of each type was randomly selected. Within each replicate labeling set, the sample to channel mapping was randomized. All the labeled samples that belonged to one iTRAQ replicate set were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac (RVC 2-25 CD Plus, Martin Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Samples were desalted by passing them first through 0.5 mL bed volume detergent removal columns (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and then through 1 cc C18 reversed phase SepPak columns (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) according to the manufacturers manuals. Samples were dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in nanoLC buffer A (5% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)). Samples were analyzed in random order using an Easy nanoLC 1000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected online to a Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific) mass-analyzer. Peptides were separated on a 50 cm long C18 RP RSLC Easyspray column (2 Âµm particle size; Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min with a 200 min gradient from nanoLC buffer A to 40% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid. Each sample was injected twice with two different analysis methods: a fast and a sensitive method, as described by Kelstrup et al. (Kelstrup et al., 2012), on the same column.

### Data Protocol
The outputs of both mass-spectrometry runs were combined as merged mass-lists and searched against the rat reference proteome set (UniProt, version October 2013, canonical isoforms only) using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4.0.288 software (Thermo Scientific). SequestHT (implemented in Proteome Discoverer) was used as the search tool and iTRAQ-reporter ion intensities were determined from Proteome Discoverer. The Percolator node of Proteome Discoverer was used to estimate peptide-level adjusted p-values (q-values). iTRAQ peptide-level quantification data were exported and further processed in the R statistical environment (R Development Core Team, 2007). The quantification data were filtered for a q-value < 0.01 and for unique quantification results as defined in Proteome Discoverer. A global variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) was performed with the corresponding Bioconductor package in R (Huber et al., 2002; Hultin-Rosenberg et al., 2013). Each iTRAQ reporter ion set was normalized to its median and protein expression values were calculated as the median of these normalized peptide-level quantification values (Herbrich et al., 2013).

### Publication Abstract
While the toxicity of the main constituents of electronic cigarette (ECIG) liquids, nicotine, propylene glycol (PG), and vegetable glycerin (VG), has been assessed individually in separate studies, limited data on the inhalation toxicity of them is available when in mixtures. In this 90-day subchronic inhalation study, Sprague-Dawley rats were nose-only exposed to filtered air, nebulized vehicle (saline), or three concentrations of PG/VG mixtures, with and without nicotine. Standard toxicological endpoints were complemented by molecular analyses using transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Compared with vehicle exposure, the PG/VG aerosols showed only very limited biological effects with no signs of toxicity. Addition of nicotine to the PG/VG aerosols resulted in effects in line with nicotine effects observed in previous studies, including up-regulation of xenobiotic enzymes (Cyp1a1/Fmo3) in the lung and metabolic effects, such as reduced serum lipid concentrations and expression changes of hepatic metabolic enzymes. No toxicologically relevant effects of PG/VG aerosols (up to 1.520&#xa0;&#xa0;mg&#xa0;PG/L&#xa0;+&#xa0;1.890&#xa0;mg VG/L) were observed, and no adverse effects for PG/VG/nicotine were observed up to 438/544/6.6&#xa0;mg/kg/day. This study demonstrates how complementary systems toxicology analyses can reveal, even in the absence of observable adverse effects, subtoxic and adaptive responses to pharmacologically active compounds such as nicotine.
