### Title
PTMs of the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

### Description
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a recently discovered enzyme family that cleave polysaccharides by oxidation. Despite proposed roles in bacterial virulence, no direct functional data exist to validate these claims. Here we show PTMs detected on CpbD.

### Sample Protocol
CbpD was digested in-solution using trypsin or chymotrypsin. The peptides were solubilized in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted using C18 ZipTips. The peptide mixture was analyzed using a nano HPLC coupled to a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer

### Data Protocol
Mass spectral data were acquired using Xcalibur (v.2.2 SP1) and analyzed with PEAKS. 0.1% FDR was used and only modified peptides with AScore > 20 were considered valid.
