### Title
Immune surveillance of acute myeloid leukemia is mediated by HLA-presented antigens on leukemia progenitor cells

### Description
Persistent therapy-resistant leukemic progenitor cells (LPC) are a main cause of disease relapse and recurrence in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Specific LPC-targeting therapies may thus improve treatment outcome of AML patients. We demonstrate that LPCs present human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cancer antigens that induce T cell responses allowing for immune surveillance of AML. Using a mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics approach we characterized the antigenic landscape of patient LPCs and identify AML/LPC-associated HLA-presented antigens as well as mutation-derived and cryptic neoepitopes as prime targets for development of T cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches. We observed frequent spontaneous memory T cells targeting these AML/LPC-associated antigens in AML patients and showed that antigen-specific T cell recognition and HLA class II immunopeptidome diversity impacts clinical outcome. Our results pave the way for implementation of AML/LPC-associated antigens for T cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches to specifically target and eliminate residual LPCs in AML patients.

### Sample Protocol
Peripheral blood mononuclear or bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients at the time of diagnosis or at relapse were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Enrichment of CD34+CD38- LPCs were performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting or magnetic-activated cell sorting. Snap-frozen cells were stored at -80°C. HLA class I and HLA class II molecules were isolated by standard immunoaffinity purification using the pan-HLA class I-specific W6/32, the pan-HLA class II-specific Tü-39, and the HLA-DR-specific L243 monoclonal antibodies. Peptides were separated by nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography using a 50 µm x 25 cm PepMap rapid separation column (Thermo Fisher) and a gradient ranging from 2.4 to 32.0% acetonitrile over the course of 90 min. Eluting peptides were analyzed in an online-coupled Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectron spray ion source using a data dependent acquisition mode employing a top speed (3 s) collisional-induced dissociation (CID, HLA class I peptides) or higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD, HLA class II peptides) fragmentation method.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed using the SEQUEST HT search engine (University of Washington) with the human proteome as comprised in the Swiss-Prot database (20,279 reviewed protein sequences, September 27th 2013) without enzymatic restriction. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Oxidized methionine was allowed as a dynamic modification. The FDR was estimated using the Percolator algorithm and limited to 5% for HLA class I and 1% for HLA class II. Peptide lengths were limited to 8 - 12 amino acids for HLA class I and to 8 - 25 amino acids for HLA class II. Protein inference was disabled, allowing for multiple protein annotations of peptides.
