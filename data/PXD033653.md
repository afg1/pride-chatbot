### Title
Proteomic changes in the hypothalamus after treatment with GLP-1RA, Tesaglitazar, or GLP-1RA/Tesaglitazar (GLP-1RA mediated Tesaglitazar delivery)

### Description
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARùõº/ùõæ) play important roles in the regulation of energy, lipid and glucose metabolism. Drugs targeting these proteins such as Fibrates and TZDs have both shown beneficial cardiovascular effects in clinical trials, which together with their complementary action on glucose and lipid metabolism spurred the development of PPARùõº/ùõæ dual-agonists (Glitazars) for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (T2D) and dyslipidemia. While effectively improving glucose and lipid metabolism in clinical trials, the development of many Glitazars was terminated due to unfavorable effects on the cardiovascular and/or renal system. Here we evaluate a single molecule conjugate of the PPARùõº/ùõæ dual-agonist Tesaglitazar covalently attached to the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). We hypothesized that GLP-1-mediated delivery of Tesaglitazar as well as synergism between the two agents would lead to overal beneficial effects and decrease the TZD risk profile.

### Sample Protocol
Proteomics sample preparation Frozen tissue samples were homogenized in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 2% SDC, heated for 5 min at 95¬∞C and sonicated (Diagenode Bioruptor at high intensity, 15 x 30s). 50 ¬µg of protein was reduced and alkylated with 10 mM TCEP,40 mM CAA for 5 min at 40¬∞C in the dark. Samples were digested with trypsin and LysC 1:50 (enzyme:protein) overnight at 37¬∞C. Digested peptides were acidified to a final concentration of 1% TFA and loaded onto activated triple layer styrenedivinylbenzene‚Äìreversed phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS; 3 M Empore) STAGE tips. STAGE tips were washed with 100 ¬µl ethylacetate 1% TFA, 100 ¬µl 30% Methanol 1% TFA and 150 ¬µl 0.2% TFA. Peptides were eluted with 60 ¬µl SDB-RPS elution buffer (80% ACN, 5% NH4OH), concentrated in a SpeedVac for 40 min at 45¬∞C and dissolved in 10 ¬µl MS loading buffer (2% ACN, 0.1% TFA).  LC-MS/MS analysis Single-shot measurements were performed with 500 ng of purified peptides, determined by absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDrop 2000. Peptides were loaded onto a 50-cm column, packed in-house with 1.9 ¬µm C18 ReproSil particles (Dr. Maisch GmbH) with an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Column temperature was kept at 60¬∞C using a column oven. Peptides were eluted over 60 min using a binary buffer system consisting of buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). In brief, the gradient started with 5% buffer B and increased stepwise to 45% over 45min, followed by a wash-out at 95% buffer B, all at a flowrate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were then transferred to the gas phase using electrospray ionization (ESI), pre-filtered by a FAIMS device (CV -50 V) before entering the Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. A data-independent (DIA) acquisition method was used, in which one full scan (300-1650 m/z, max. ion fill time of 45ms, normalized AGC target = 300%, R= 120.000 at 200 m/z) was followed by 66 tMS2 fragment scans of unequally-spaced windows with 1 Th overlap, covering the same m/z range (fill time = 22 ms, normalized AGC target = 1000%, normalized HCD collision energy = 30%, R= 15.000).

### Data Protocol
DIA raw files were processed using Spectronaut version 14.5.200813.47784 using the directDIA function with default settings. Raw files from samples of the same tissue were processed together and searched against the mouse UniProt FASTA database (September 2014, 51,210 entries) and the provided MaxQuant contaminants list (245 entries). Spectronaut report files were then loaded into Perseus (v.1.6.2.3). In brief, quantified proteins were filtered for ‚â• 3 valid values in at least one biological condition and annotations mapped from UniProtKB, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Significantly up- or downregulated proteins between the conditions were determined by ANOVA (FDR 0.025).

### Publication Abstract
Dual agonists activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPAR&#x251;/&#x263;) have beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes, but their development was discontinued due to potential adverse effects. Here we report the design and preclinical evaluation of a molecule that covalently links the PPAR&#x251;/&#x263; dual-agonist tesaglitazar to a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to allow for GLP-1R-dependent cellular delivery of tesaglitazar. GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar does not differ from the pharmacokinetically matched GLP-1RA in GLP-1R signalling, but shows GLP-1R-dependent PPAR&#x263;-retinoic acid receptor heterodimerization and enhanced improvements of body weight, food intake and glucose metabolism relative to the GLP-1RA or tesaglitazar alone in obese male mice. The conjugate fails to affect body weight and glucose metabolism in GLP-1R knockout mice and shows preserved effects in obese mice at subthreshold doses for the GLP-1RA and tesaglitazar. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomics identified PPAR regulated proteins in the hypothalamus that are acutely upregulated by GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar. Our data show that GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar improves glucose control with superior efficacy to the GLP-1RA or tesaglitazar alone and suggest that this conjugate might hold therapeutic value to acutely treat hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance.
