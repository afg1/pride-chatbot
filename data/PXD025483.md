### Title
The role of linear ubiquitination in memory formation

### Description
This project examined the role of linear polyubiquitination in the amygdala during fear memory formation in male and female rats.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were basolateral amygdala tissue dissected from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent fear conditioning (“trained”, 5 male and 5 female) or remained “naïve” (5 male and 5 female).  Samples were homogenized in denaturing lysis buffer (0.02% SDS) with 70mM NEM, briefly centrifuged and supernatant collected.  Normalized samples were mixed with M1 tandem ubiquitin binding entity (TUBE; Life Sensors) bound to magnetic streptavidin beads and incubated at 4°C.  Samples were then washed and protein eluted in 1x sample buffer at 95°C, 800 rpm for 5 minutes.  Samples were processed utilizing S-Trap micro columns (Protofi) and trypsin.  Recovered peptides were analyzed via LC-ESI-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid instrument (Thermo) running each sample in duplicate.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed and processed utilizing Proteome Discoverer v. 2.5 (Thermo) merging the results from a Sequest HT search and a Mascot server v. 2.7 (Matrix Science) search of the rat reference proteome downloaded from UniProt and a common contaminants database provided with Proteome Discoverer.  Simultaneous searching of a decoy database allowed for determination of a false discovery rate.  Protein quantities were the sum of the intensities of the associated peptides.  Values were normalized to streptavidin amount and averaged for duplicate runs prior to statistical analyisis.
