### Title
Effecst of metformin on the human gut micorbiome

### Description
To test the effects of metformin on the human gut micorbiome, we fist collected human stool samples. We processed the samples in vitro culturing under anaerobic condition for 24 hours using the rapidAIM assay and either and cultured them with metformin, or DMSO as a control. We know that metformin can alter the human gut microbiome and were interested in better analyzing which functional proceses were altered.

### Sample Protocol
The culture samples were lysed using sonification, and  4% SDS/8M Urea. The SDS was then removed for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Spectra search and peptide quantitation was completed using MetaLab  v1.2.0 using a database search of the IGC database.
