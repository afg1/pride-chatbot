### Title
Evaluation by re-derivation of a paternal line after 18th generations on seminal traits, proteome and fertility: Seminal Plasma Spectral Library

### Description
Breeding schemes for meat production in rabbits involved a three-way cross of specialized lines in which a paternal line inseminates maternal crossbred females. Paternal line or terminal sire are selected for growth traits, being the males used for the production of fertile dose at the insemination centres and farms. So high growth rate males must produce, in addition, semen in sufficient quantity and quality to meet the demand of insemination and, nevertheless, several studies have been showed that selection for growth have effects on reproduction performance in female and males. In rabbits, negative effects has been observed in ovulation induction, prenatal survival and genetic correlation to fertility. Many factors influence the production and quality of rabbit semen, management as collection frequency, environment (season or photoperiod, nutrition and genetic. Most of the previous studies have been focused in the effects of selection on the seminal and sperm parameters but, little attention has been paid to the protein seminal plasma or sperm composition and if these changes could be affect the fertility of seminal doses obtained from the paternal males.   The aim of this study was to evaluate if selection program by daily gain in fattening period has changed seminal traits, plasma and sperm proteoma and, the fertility of semen when it is used in artificial insemination. To do this we uses two re-derived groups of paternal males obtained from vitrified embryos with a difference of 18 generations between both groups.

### Sample Protocol
Animals A total of 39 males of the genetic line ‘‘R’’ from the Polytechnic University of Valencia were used. Line R is a paternal line selected during 36 generations for daily gain between 28 and 63 day old. Selection is based on phenotypic values of daily gain (DG) and is conducted in non-overlapping generations. Environmental conditions were maintained using a control system for light (16:8 light/dark photoperiod), with free access to water and commercial pelleted diets (minimum of 15 g of crude protein per kg of dry matter, 15 g of crude fiber per kg of DM, and 10.2 MJ of digestible energy per kg of dry matter). A total of 311 commercial crossbreed females were used to perform to study of fertility and prolificacy. Females were keep in similar environmental conditions. Semen collection At 5 months of age, males started a four-weeks training period with artificial vaginas, one ejaculate was collected per male weekly. At the 6th month of age males have been subjected to experimental evaluation. Collections were performed on the same day for 10 weeks; one ejaculate was collected per male and per week to exam seminal parameters. Semen was collected early in the morning. Only ejaculates exhibiting a white color were used in the experiment, if the first ejaculate was not available (with urine, sediment, contaminated or cell debris) a second one was collected 20 minutes later, if gel was present, it was removed. Plasma and Sperm protein extraction samples Ejaculates from 20 mature males were collected and pooled (10 for each experimental group (G21V and G39V). Six pooled ejaculates were obtained in three different weeks and used to insemination, before to elaborate sperm doses, a sample of 500µl from ejaculate pools was centrifuged at 7,400 x g for 10 min at 22 ºC. The supernatants were collected, supplemented with a 1% v/v protease inhibitor cocktail (P2714, Sigma) and stored at -80ºC until use. The resulting pellets were washed twice by centrifugation n at 900 x g for 10 min in PBS.  Sperm proteins were extracted according to Casares et al. (2019) protocol. Briefly, sperm pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS (w/v) in TCG (Tris-citrate-glucose supplemented with a 1% v/v protease inhibitor cocktail, P2714) and sonicated on ice 6 times for 5 s at 30% amplitude using an Ultrasonic Lab Homogenizer UP 100 H (Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH). After sonication, the solution was kept in ice for 15 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 x g at 4ºC. Protein lysates were stored at -80ºC until use.   Sample preparation A pooled sample with all the membrane samples was done with 10 g of every sample. 50 g of this pool were resolved in 1D PAGE gel, and the gel cut in 5 slices. Every gel slice was in gel digested as described elsewhere (Shevchenko A, Jensen ON, Podtelejnikov AV, Sagliocco F, Wilm M, Vorm O, Mortensen P, Boucherie H, Mann M. Linking genome and proteome by mass spectrometry: large-scale identification of yeast proteins from two dimensional gels. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1996; 93:14440-14445). 400 ng of trypsin were used for each sample, and digestion was set to 37 ºC on. The trypsin digestion was stopped with 10% TFA and the SN was removed, then the library gel slides were dehydrated with pure ACN. The new peptide solutions were combined with the corresponding SN. The peptide mixtures were dried in a speed vacuum and re suspended in 2 % ACN; 0.1% TFA. The volume was adjusted to 12 L. LCMSMS Analysis for library. Data dependent acquisition (DDA) 5 µl of the digested fragments were loaded onto a trap column (NanoLC Column, 3µ C18-CL, 75umx15cm ; Eksigent) and desalted with 0.1% TFA at 3µl/min during  5 min. The peptides were loaded onto an analytical column (LC Column, 3 µ  C18-CL, 75umx12cm, Nikkyo) equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile  0.1% FA (formic acid). Peptide elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 5 to 35% B in 30min (A: 0.1% FA; B: ACN, 0.1% FA) for  at a flow rate of 300nl/min. Peptides were analyzed in a mass spectrometer nanoESI qQTOF (5600 TripleTOF, ABSCIEX). The tripleTOF was operated in information-dependent acquisition mode, in which a 250-ms TOF MS scan from 350–1250 m/z, was performed, followed by 150-ms product ion scans from 350–1500 m/z on the 25 most intense 2-5 charged ions. The rolling collision energies equations were set for all ions as for 2+ ions according to the following equations: |CE|=(0.065)x(m/z)+(-3).

### Data Protocol
ProteinPilot v5.0. search engine (Sciex). ProteinPilot (version 5.0), ProteinPilot default parameters were used to generate peak list directly from 5600 TripleTof  wiff files. The Paragon algorithm (Shilov, I. V., S. L. Seymour, et al. (2007). Mol Cell Proteomics 6(9): 1638-55) of ProteinPilot was used to search the UniprotMammals database (03.2018) with the following parameters: trypsin specificity, cys-alkylation, without taxonomy restriction, and the search effort set to through and FDR correction for proteins. The protein grouping was done by Pro group algorithm:  A protein group in a Pro Group Report is a set of proteins that share some physical evidence. Unlike sequence alignment analyses where full length theoretical sequences are compared, the formation of protein groups in Pro Group is guided entirely by observed peptides only. Since the observed peptides are actually determined from experimentally acquired spectra, the grouping can be considered to be guided by usage of spectra. Then, unobserved regions of protein sequence play no role in explaining the data
