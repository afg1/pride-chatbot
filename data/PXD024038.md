### Title
Quantitative Proteomics Identifies  Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B as Modulator of B Cell Antigen Receptor Signaling

### Description
B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is initiated by protein kinases and limited by counteracting phosphatases that currently are less well studied in their regulation of BCR signaling. We here used the B cell line Ramos to identify and quantify human B cell signaling components. Specifically, a protein tyrosine phosphatase profiling revealed a high expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in Ramos and human naive B cells. The loss of PTP1B leads to increased B cell activation. Through substrate trapping in combination with quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified 22 putative substrates or interactors of PTP1B. We validated Igalpha, CD22, PLCgamma1/2, CBL, BCAP and APLP2 as specific substrates of PTP1B in Ramos B cells. The tyrosine kinase BTK and the two adaptor proteins GRB2 and VAV1 were identified as direct binding partners and potential substrates of PTP1B. We showed that PTP1B dephosphorylates the inhibitory receptor protein CD22 at phosphotyrosine 807. We conclude that PTP1B negatively modulates BCR signaling by dephosphorylating distinct phosphotyrosines in B cell specific receptor proteins and various downstream signaling components.

### Sample Protocol
Sample Preparation for Global Proteome Analysis Ramos B cells were harvested and washed three times with ice-cold 1x PBS. Cells were lysed in 30 mM Tris base with 7 M urea and 2 M thiourea, pH 8.5, supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche). To aid cell lyses and to sheer DNA, cells were sonicated on ice at least twice with an ultrasonic homogenizer for 10 s at 90% of maximum power. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 21.000 x g and 4°C. Samples containing 300 µg of total protein were prepared and cysteine residues were reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 20 min at room temperature (RT) and alkylated with 50 mM CAM for 20 min at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Each sample was then diluted 1:1 with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested with Lys-C (protein to enzyme ratio 1:100, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals Europe GmbH, Neuss, Germany) for 4 h at 37°C Subsequently, the sample was diluted 1:1 with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and proteins were digested with trypsin (protein to enzyme ratio 1:50, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) overnight at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by acidification with TFA (1% [v/v] final concentration) and the peptide sample was desalted using a Empore Solid Phase Extraction cartridge (3M Bioanalytical Technologies, St. Paul, USA). The cartridge was washed with 1 ml methanol followed by 1 ml 70% ACN with 0.1% TFA. The column was conditioned twice with 0.5 ml 0.1% TFA before the sample was applied. Peptides were washed with 0.5 ml 0.1% TFA and eluted with 0.5 ml 70% ACN. Peptides were freeze-dried overnight using an Alpha 1-2 LDplus system (Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany)  High-pH Reversed-phase Fractionation High-pH reversed-phase fractionation was performed on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped with a Gemini-NX 3µ C18 110 Å column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). The desalted sample was taken up in 300 µl of 10 mM NH4OH (solvent A). A constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min was applied and peptides were loaded onto the column at 1% solvent B (10 mM NH4OH in 90% ACN) for 5 min. Peptides were separated applying a linear gradient from 1% B to 61% B in 55 min, followed by an increase to 78% B in 2 min, a decrease to 1% B in 5 min, and re-equilibration of the column for 16 min. Fractions were collected every 43 s, starting at 1.5 min until 70 min. Of the collected 96 fractions, every 32nd fraction was pooled.  High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) equipped with two PepMap C18 μ-precolumn (0.3 mm × 5 mm, 5 µm, 300 Å Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an Acclaim PepMap analytical column (75 μm × 250 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific).  For global proteome analysis, the RSLC system was coupled to a Q Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo Scientific). A solvent system consisting of  0.1% FA (solvent A) and 86% ACN, 0.1% FA (solvent B) was used for peptide separation. The RSLC was operated with a flow rate of 0.250 µl/min for the analytical column. The gradient was 4% to 40% B in 50 min, followed by 40 to 95% B in 5 min. After 5 min at 95%, the column was re-equilibrated for 15 min with 4% B. Full scans were acquired in the orbitrap in a mass range of m/z 375 to 1,700 with the following parameters: R, 70,000 at m/z 200; AGC, 3x10^6 ions; max. IT, 60 ms. For MS/MS experiments, a TOP12 method was used and parameters were as follows: NCE, 28%; DE 45 s; AGC, 5,000; max. IT, 120 ms.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were searched against the Uniprot Human Proteome set (release 2016_12, 92,960 protein entries) using MaxQuant 1.5.4.0 with its integrated search engine Andromeda (Cox and Mann 2008; Cox et al. 2011). The species was restricted to homo sapiens as Ramos B cells are of human origin. MaxQuant default settings were used unless stated otherwise. Database searches were conducted with trypsin and Lys-C proteolytic enzymes, a maximum number of two missed cleavages, and mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for precursor and 0.5 Da (CID data) or 20 ppm (HCD data) for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was applied as variable modifications. The minimum number of unique peptides was set to 1. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was applied to both peptide and protein lists. “Match between runs” was enabled with default settings. The multiplicity was set to two and “Requantify” was enabled. For protein quantification, “razer and unique peptides” were used with a minimum ratio count of 2. For the determination of significantly enriched proteins, normalized SILAC ratios were log2-transformed and a mean log2 ratio over at least 3 out of 4 replicates was calculated. P-values were determined with a two-sided t-test in Perseus 1.5.2.6 (Tyanova et al. 2016).
