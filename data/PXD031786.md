### Title
Paleoproteomics of ancient human teeth

### Description
Teeth are a well-known source of information for paleoanthropologists. Here, we established the ancient dental metaproteomes in several samples from historic sites. The shotgun metaproteomics analysis relies on a iterative search strategy for the identification of the proteins and their origins.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, treated with chemical reagents for fixing the cysteine modification, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed with an Exploris 480 tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed by means of a metaproteomics cascade strategy. Peptides and taxonomical information associated to these peptides, and spectral counts were extracted.
