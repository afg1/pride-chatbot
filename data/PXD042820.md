### Title
CF-MS experiment in honey bee midgut

### Description
his experiment is for 10 replicates of honey bee midgut tissue analyzed through a protein correlation profiling pipeling. Briefly, tissues were gently lysed, enriched for protein complexes and fractionated using size exclusion chromtography

### Sample Protocol
Isolated protein complexes were digested using a standard urea/thiourea protocol, with slight adaptations. Peptides were desalted by C18 STAGE TIP and LC-MS/MS was done with UHPLC coupled to TIMS-TOF pro (Bruker) with DIA-PASEF.

### Data Protocol
Peptide data was searched using DIA-NN (v.1.8.1). Spectral library was generated using honey bee + contaminants + pathogens FASTA file. carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification. Generally, parameters were kept at the default settings. Protein inference was set to Protein names from FASTA
