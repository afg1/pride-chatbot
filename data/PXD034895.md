### Title
The augmin complex architecture reveals structural insights into microtubule branching

### Description
In mitosis, the augmin complex binds to spindle microtubules to recruit the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), the principal microtubule nucleator, for the formation of branched microtubules. Our understanding of augmin-mediated microtubule branching is strongly hampered by the lack of structural information on the augmin complex. Here we elucidate the molecular architecture and define the conformational plasticity of the augmin complex using an integrative structural biology approach. The elongated structure of the augmin complex is characterised by extensive coiled-coil segments and comprises two structural elements with distinct but complementary functions in γ-TuRC and microtubule binding, linked by a flexible hinge. The augmin complex is recruited to microtubules via a composite microtubule binding site comprising a positively charged unordered extension and two Calponin homology domains. Our study provides the structural basis for augmin function in branched microtubule formation, decisively fostering our understanding of spindle formation in mitosis.

### Sample Protocol
50 ug of AEC-purified TIII tetramer was crosslinked for 15 min (RT, 600 rpm) with 0.1 mM bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] (BS3, Thermo Fisher). Reaction was stopped by adding Tris-HCl to a final concentration of 100 mM. Afterwards, sample was incubated for 30 min (50 °C, 600 rpm) with dithiothreitol (DTT) concentration adjusted to 10 mM. Then, 2-chloroacetamide (CAA) was added to a final concentration of 50 mM and reaction was  incubated for 30 min at RT protected from light. Subsequently, trypsin (Promega, V511A) was added (1:50, trypsin to protein concentration) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C and reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1% (v/v).  Digested peptides were concentrated and desalted using an OASIS® HLB µElution Plate (Waters) according to manufacturer instructions. Crosslinked peptides were enriched using size exclusion chromatography. Briefly, desalted peptides were reconstituted with SEC buffer (30% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% (v/v) TFA) and fractionated using a Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/30 column (Cytiva) on a 1200 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Fractions eluting between 50-70 ul were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 30 μl 4% (v/v) ACN in 1% (v/v) formic acid (FA). Collected fractions were analysed by liquid chromatography (LC) ‐coupled tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system (Dionex) fitted with a trapping cartridge (µ-Precolumn C18 PepMap 100, 5µm, 300 µm i.d. x 5 mm, 100 Å) and an analytical column (nanoEase™ M/Z HSS T3 column 75 µm x 250 mm C18, 1.8 µm, 100 Å, Waters). Trapping was carried out with a constant flow of trapping solvent (0.05% TFA in water) at 30 µL/min onto the trapping column for 6 minutes. Subsequently, peptides were eluted and separated on the analytical column using a gradient composed of Solvent A ((3% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (3% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) with a constant flow of 0.3 µL/min. The outlet of the analytical column was coupled directly to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer using the nanoFlex source. The peptides were introduced into the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos via a Pico-Tip Emitter 360 µm OD x 20 µm ID; 10 µm tip (CoAnn Technologies) and an applied spray voltage of 2.1 kV, instrument was operated in positive mode. The capillary temperature was set at 275°C. Only charge states of 4-8 were included. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30 sec. and the intensity threshold was 5e4. Full mass scans were acquired for a mass range 350-1,300 m/z in profile mode in the orbitrap with resolution of 120,000. The AGC target was set to Standard and the injection time mode was set to Auto. The instrument was operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with a cycle time of 3 sec between master scans and MSMS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000, with a fill time of up to 100 ms and a limitation of 2e5 ions (AGC target). A normalised collision energy of 32 was applied. MS2 data was acquired in profile mode.

### Data Protocol
All data were analysed using the cross-linking module in Mass Spec Studio v2.4.0.3524. Parameters were set as follows: Trypsin (K/R only), charge states 4−8, peptide length 7−50, percent Evalue threshold = 50, MS mass tolerance = 5 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance = 10, elution width = 0.5 min. BS3 cross-link residue pairs were constrained to K on one end and one of KSTY on the other. Identifications were manually validated, and only cross-links with an E-value corresponding to <5% FDR were retained. Afterwards, the data were exported from Mass Spec Studio to obtain a list of cross-links with a unique pair of peptide sequences and a unique set of potential residue sites (Supplementary Data 1). Multiple identifications for a given pair of peptide sequences was permitted only if chromatographic separation from any other identification exceeded one chromatographic peak width (i.e., >0.3 min).  Only one copy of each crosslink site with higher score was extracted from exported file (Supplementary Data 2) and crosslink sites with score higher than 250 were used for model validation and preparation of bar plots (Supplementary Data 3). Bar plots were prepared in Xvis and model validation was performed using Xlink Analyzersetting a distance threshold to 30 Å. Scores for validation using Xlink Analyzer were normalised by a factor of 10.

### Publication Abstract
In mitosis, the augmin complex binds to spindle microtubules to recruit the &#x3b3;-tubulin ring complex (&#x3b3;-TuRC), the principal microtubule nucleator, for the formation of branched microtubules. Our understanding of augmin-mediated microtubule branching is hampered by the lack of structural information on the augmin complex. Here, we elucidate the molecular architecture and conformational plasticity of the augmin complex using an integrative structural biology approach. The elongated structure of the augmin complex is characterised by extensive coiled-coil segments and comprises two structural elements with distinct but complementary functions in &#x3b3;-TuRC and microtubule binding, linked by a flexible hinge. The augmin complex is recruited to microtubules via a composite microtubule binding site comprising a positively charged unordered extension and two calponin homology domains.
