### Title
Fasting, FDFT1 expression and colorectal cancer

### Description
First, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of FDFT1 and lentivirus-mediated knockdown of FDFT1 were performed in CT26 cells. Then control CT26 cells, FDFT1 overexpressing CT26 cells and FDFT1 knockdown CT26 cells were cultured under normal medium or fasting mimic medium. Fasting mimic medium was done by incubating cells in glucose-free DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 0.5g/L glucose and 1% FBS for 48h. So we have 6 groups: control CT26 cells, FDFT1 overexpressing CT26 cells,  FDFT1 knockdown CT26 cells, control CT26 cells-under fasting mimic medium, FDFT1 overexpressing CT26 cells- under fasting mimic medium,  FDFT1 knockdown CT26 cells- under fasting mimic medium.

### Sample Protocol
After samples were lysised in 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Ltd., Switzerland), the proteins were digested with sequence-grade modified trypsin (Promega, WI) and lyophilized. The resultant peptide mixture was labeled with iTRAQ 8Plex labeling kit (Sciex) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The peptide mixture was fractionated by high pH separation using Ultimate 3000 system (ThermoFisher scientific, USA). The peptides were analyzed by on-line nanospray LC-MS/MS. Tandem mass spectra were processed by PEAKS Studio version 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Canada). Different expressed proteins were filtered if their fold change were over 1.5 and contained at least 2 unique peptides with significance over 13.

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were processed by PEAKS Studio version 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Canada). PEAKS DB was set up to search the UniProt-human database (ver.201712, 71781 entries) assuming trypsin as the digestion enzyme. PEAKS DB were searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 7 ppm. Carbamidomethylation (C) and iTRAQ labeling (K, Protein N-term) were specified as the fixed modifications. Oxidation (M), Deamidation (NQ), Acetylation (Protein N-term), were specified as the variable modifications. Peptides were filter by 1% FDR and 1 unique. ANOVA was used for peptide and protein abundance calculation. Normalization was performed on averaging the abundance of all peptides. Medians were used for averaging. Different expressed proteins were filtered if their fold change were over 1.5 and contained at least 2 unique peptides with significance over 13.

### Publication Abstract
Evidence suggests that fasting exerts extensive antitumor effects in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism behind this response is unclear. We investigate the effect of fasting on glucose metabolism and malignancy in CRC. We find that fasting upregulates the expression of a cholesterogenic gene, Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1), during the inhibition of CRC cell aerobic glycolysis and proliferation. In addition, the downregulation of FDFT1 is correlated with malignant progression and poor prognosis in CRC. Moreover, FDFT1 acts as a critical tumor suppressor in CRC. Mechanistically, FDFT1 performs its tumor-inhibitory function by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR/HIF1&#x3b1; signaling. Furthermore, mTOR inhibitor can synergize with fasting in inhibiting the proliferation of CRC. These results indicate that FDFT1 is a key downstream target of the fasting response and may be involved in CRC cell glucose metabolism. Our results suggest therapeutic implications in CRC and potential crosstalk between a cholesterogenic gene and glycolysis.
