### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis of co-cultured breast cancer cells

### Description
Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer glucose metabolism. Here we suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from cancer cells can modulate glucose metabolism in the recipient cancer cells and induce cell proliferation and aggressive cancer phenotypes. Two breast cancer cell lines with different levels of glycolytic activity, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, were selected and co-cultured, as the originating and recipient cells. The change in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of the recipient MCF7 cells was assessed after co-culture with the MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteomics analysis was performed to investigate the changes in the protein expression patterns in the recipient MCF7 cells. FDG uptake by the recipient MCF7 cells was sig-nificantly increased after co-culture with the MDA-MB-231 cells.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with 300μL of lysis buff-er (1% SDS, 1 mM TCEP in 0.1 M TEAB pH 8.5). Protein concentration was measured using a BCA reducing agent compatible assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins were precipitated by adding ice-cold acetone overnight. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in a 30μL denaturation buffer (4% SDS and 100 mM DTT in 0.1M TEAB pH 8.5). After heating at 95℃ for 15 min, denatured proteins were loaded onto 30kDa amicon filter (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The buffer was ex-changed with UA solution (8 M UREA in 0.1 M TEAB pH 8.5) by centrifugation at 14,000 g three times. After removal of SDS, cysteine alkylation was achieved by adding an alkylation buffer (50 mM IAA, 8 M UREA in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Three additional buffer exchanges were performed with 40mM TEAB pH 8.5. Proteins were digested with trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio [w/w] of 1:100) at 37℃ overnight. The digested peptides were collected by centrifuga-tion and the peptide concentrations were measured using a tryptophan assay.

### Data Protocol
MS raw files were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software based on the SEQUEST-HT search engine against the Human UniProt database. Database searches were performed using a 10-ppm precursor ion tolerance and a 0.02 Da MS/MS ion tol-erance. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N-termini and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues were established as fixed modifications, while oxidation of me-thionine residues was set as a variable modification.
