### Title
Penicillium oxalicum mutant EU2106 secretome  LC-MS/MS

### Description
Comparative assays of the secretomes of P. oxalicum strains HP7-1 and its mutant EU2106 .

### Sample Protocol
Culture supernatants from P. oxalicum strains HP7-1 and EU2106 were filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane filter after adding two cOmplete, EDTA-free tablets per 100 mL of medium, and subsequently concentrated by ultrafiltration with a 10-kDa concentrator.The secreted proteins were precipitated with acetone at −20 °C overnight.

### Data Protocol
After screening using the Proteome Discovery with SEQUEST search engine software , LC-MS/MS data were mapped to the P. oxalicum protein database and analyzed.
