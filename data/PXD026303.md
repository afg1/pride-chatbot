### Title
Aorta-on-a-chip reveals impaired mitochondrial dynamics as a therapeutic target for aortic aneurysm in bicuspid aortic valve disease

### Description
Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiovascular disease in general population and is frequently associated with the development of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). There is no effective strategy to intervene with TAA progression due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis. In this study, protein analyses of human aortic tissues showed the insufficient expression of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA. To verify it, we constructed aorta-on-a-chip to replicate the rhythmic tensile on human aorta, on which human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) endured a microenvironment of biomimetic strain unattainable in animal models. HAoSMCs with NOTCH1-knockdown exhibited reduced contractile phenotype and were accompanied by attenuated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, we identified that mitochondrial fusion activators (leflunomide and teriflunomide) or mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi-1) rescued the mitochondrial dysfunction in HAoSMCs from BAV-TAA patients. These findings suggest that impaired mitochondrial dynamics could be a potential therapeutic target for BAV-TAA.

### Sample Protocol
Aortic were washed with PBS for three times and homogenized in lysis buffer, RIPA (Beyotime) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) on ice for 30min. After centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 25min, the supernatant containing proteins was retained for protein concentration quantification by BCA (Pierce). Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was performed for protein digestion. Before alkylated with 10 mM Dithiothreitol (Sigma) and 30 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), lysate containing 100 μg protein were loaded in 10 kDa centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore), then replacement with 50 mM NH4HCO3 (Sigma) for twice. Replacement was performed twice again for filtering the reducing agent. Trypsin (Beijing Life Proteomic) was added at ratio of 1:50, incubating at 37°C overnight. TFA was added to 0.1% to stop digesting reaction. 100ug peptides containing 0.1% TFA was loading in the High pH Reversed-Phase Fractionation Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, we got 10 flow through fractions, combined every two fractions by a concatenation strategy. These 5 fractions were sent to dried by vacuum centrifugation. The samples were resuspended with 30μL solvent A respectively (A: water with 0.1% formic acid; B: ACN with 0.1% formic acid), separated by nanoLC and analyzed by on-line electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The experiments were performed on a Nano AquityUPLC system (Waters Corporation) connected to a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive-HF) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an online nano-electrospray ion source. 2 μL peptide sample was loaded onto the analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75μm x 25cm) and subsequently separated with a linear gradient, from 5% B to 30% B in 110 min. The column was re-equilibrated at initial conditions for 10 min. The column flow rate was maintained at 300nL/min and column temperature was maintained at 45℃. The electrospray voltage of 2.2 kV versus the inlet of the mass spectrometer was used. The Q-Exactive-HF mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to switch automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra (m/z 350-1500) were acquired with a mass resolution of 60K. The AGC taget was set to 3000000, and the maximum injection time was 50ms. Fifteen sequential high energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans with a resolution of 15.0K were acquired in orbitrap. The intensity threshold was 50000, and the maximum injection time was 80 ms. The AGC target was set to 100000, and the isolation window was 1.6 m/z. Ions with charge states 2+, 3+ and 4+ were fragmented with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30%. In all cases, one microscan was recorded using dynamic exclusion of 20 seconds. MS/MS fixed first mass was set at 110.

### Data Protocol
Peaks online was used for the analysis of proteomic data. Precursor mass error tolerance was set to 10 ppm with a fragment mass error tolerance of 0.05 Da. The enzyme used was trypsin, and the maximum missed cleavage was set to 3. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification with variable modifications of Oxidation (M), Acetylation (N-term) and Deamidation (NQ) for all the software programs. The false discovery rate FDR was set to 1% for peptide and protein identifications. Total Ion Chromatography (TIC) was used for normalization. The rest of the parameters were set as default. MS/MS spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine against the SwissProt database (Taxonomy: Homo sapiens, Release 2020-11-02) (total of 20385 entries). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Limma package within the R 3.6.1.

### Publication Abstract
To function properly, the heart must remain a one-way system, pumping out oxygenated blood into the aorta &#x2013; the largest artery in the body &#x2013; so it can be distributed across the organism. The aortic valve, which sits at the entrance of the aorta, is a key component of this system. Its three flaps (or &#x2018;cusps&#x2019;) are pushed open when the blood exits the heart, and they shut tightly so it does not flow back in the incorrect direction. Nearly 1.4% of people around the world are born with &#x2018;bicuspid&#x2019; aortic valves that only have two flaps. These valves may harden or become leaky, forcing the heart to work harder. This defect is also associated with bulges on the aorta which progressively weaken the artery, sometimes causing it to rupture. Open-heart surgery is currently the only way to treat these bulges (or &#x2018;aneurysms&#x2019;), as no drug exists that could slow down disease progression. This is partly because the biological processes involved in the aneurysms worsening and bursting open is unclear. Recent studies have highlighted that many individuals with bicuspid aortic valves also have lower levels of a protein known as NOTCH1, which plays a key signalling role for cells. Problems in the mitochondria &#x2013; the structures that power up a cell &#x2013; are also observed. However, it is not known how these findings are connected or linked with the aneurysms developing. To answer this question, Abudupataer et al. analyzed the proteins present in diseased and healthy aortic muscle cells, confirming a lower production of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondria in diseased tissues. They also created an &#x2018;aorta-on-a-chip&#x2019; model where aortic muscle cells were grown in the laboratory under conditions resembling those found in the body &#x2013; including the rhythmic strain that the aorta is under because of the heart beating. Abudupataer et al. then reduced NOTCH1 levels in healthy samples, which made the muscle tissue less able to contract and reduced the activity of the mitochondria. Applying drugs that tweak mitochondrial activity helped tissues from patients with bicuspid aortic valves to work better. These compounds could potentially benefit individuals with deficient aortic valves, but experiments in animals and clinical trials would be needed first to confirm the results and assess safety. The aorta-on-a-chip model developed by Abudupataer et al. also provides a platform to screen for drugs and examine the molecular mechanisms at play in aortic diseases.
