### Title
Microdissected brain tissue Alzheimer's

### Description
we explored the proteome of the area where they are located; the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This area was microdissected from five subjects with Alzheimer disease and five non-demented controls, and quantitative mass spectrometry of pre-fractionated samples was performed.

### Sample Protocol
The microdissected tissue was dissolved in SDS-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT). Samples were reduced with 1 mM DTT and alkylated with 4 mM chloroacetamide. A modified Sera‐Mag SP3 protocol was performed for sample clean-up [28]. The SP3 beads-protein mixture was digested first by Lys-C (Pierce) for 16 h prior to trypsin digestion (16 h). Finally, the peptides were eluted from the beads-protein mixture. Peptide concentration was measured by DC-protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 45 µg of peptides from each sample were labelled with ten different amine-reactive isobaric tandem mass tags (TMTs) (TMT10plex 126-131Da, Thermo Scientific). TMT126: control1, TMT127N:control2, TMT127C:control3, TMT128N:control4, TMT128C:control5, TMT129N:AD1, TMT129C:AD2, TMT130N:AD3, TMT130C:AD4, TMT13:AD5 The pre-fractionation was done using high resolution isoelectric focusing (HiRIEF). For each LC-MS run of a HiRIEF fraction, the auto-sampler (UltiMate™ 3000 RSLCnano System, Thermo Scientific Dionex) dispensed 20 µl of mobile phase A (95% water, 5% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid) into the corresponding well of the microtitre plate, and 10 µl were injected to the LC-MS. Samples were trapped on a C18 guard-desalting column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 μm x 2 cm, nanoViper, C18, 5 µm, 100Å), and separated on a 50 cm long C18 column (Easy spray PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 μm, 100Å, 75 μm x 50 cm). At a constant flow of 250 nl/min, the curved gradient went from 2% mobile phase B (5% water, 5% DMSO, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) up to 40% solvent B in each fraction as shown in the supplementary table XX, followed by a steep increase to 100% solvent B in 5 min. Online LC-MS was performed using a coupled to a Q-Exactive-HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). FTMS master scans with 70,000 resolution (and mass range 300-1700 m/z) were followed by data-dependent MS/MS (35 000 resolution) on the top five ions using higher energy collision dissociation at 30-40% normalized collision energy. Precursors were isolated with a 2 m/z window. Automatic gain control targets were 1x106 for MS1 and 1x105 for MS2. Maximum injection times were 100 ms for MS1 and 150-200 ms for MS2. The entire duty cycle lasted approximately 2.5 s. Dynamic exclusion was used with 60 s duration. Precursors with unassigned charge state or charge state 1 were excluded. An underfill ratio of 1% was used.

### Data Protocol
Orbitrap raw MS/MS files were converted to mzML format using msConvert from the ProteoWizard tool suite [30]. Spectra were then searched using MSGF+ (v10072) [31] and Percolator (v2.08) [32], where search results from eight subsequent fractions were grouped for Percolator target/decoy analysis. All searches were done against the human protein subset of Ensembl 75 in the Galaxy platform [33]. MSGF+ settings included precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fully-tryptic peptides, maximum peptide length of 50 amino acids and a maximum charge of 6. Fixed modifications were TMT10plex on lysine residues and peptide N-termini, and carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues, a variable modification was used for oxidation on methionine residues. Quantification of TMT10plex reporter ions was done using OpenMS project's IsobaricAnalyzer (v2.0) [34]. Peptide spectra matches (PSMs) found at 1% false discovery rate (FDR) were used to infer gene identities. Protein quantification was based on TMT10plex reporter ions and calculated using TMT PSM ratios to the entire sample set (all 10 TMT-channels) and normalized to the sample median. The median PSM TMT reporter ratio from peptides that are unique to a gene symbol was then used for quantification. Only one unique peptide was required to identify a protein, and a protein FDR cut-off of 1% was applied to the list of gene-centric proteins using the picked-FDR method

### Publication Abstract
Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer disease (AD) that contributes to network disturbances and cognitive decline. Some synapses are more vulnerable than others, including the synapses of the perforant path, which provides the main excitatory input to the hippocampus. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of these synapses, we performed an explorative proteomic study of the dentate terminal zone of the perforant path. The outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where the perforant path synapses are located, was microdissected from five subjects with AD and five controls. The microdissected tissues were dissolved and digested by trypsin. Peptides from each sample were labeled with different isobaric tags, pooled together and pre-fractionated into 72 fractions by high-resolution isoelectric focusing. Each fraction was then analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We quantified the relative expression levels of 7322 proteins, whereof 724 showed significantly altered levels in AD. Our comprehensive data analysis using enrichment and pathway analyses strongly indicated that presynaptic signaling, such as exocytosis and synaptic vesicle cycle processes, is severely disturbed in this area in AD, whereas postsynaptic proteins remained unchanged. Among the significantly altered proteins, we selected three of the most downregulated synaptic proteins; complexin-1, complexin-2 and synaptogyrin-1, for further validation, using a new cohort consisting of six AD and eight control cases. Semi-quantitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining confirmed decreased levels of complexin-1, complexin-2 and synaptogyrin-1 in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in AD. Our in-depth proteomic analysis provides extensive knowledge on the potential molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction related to AD and supports that presynaptic alterations are more important than postsynaptic changes in early stages of the disease. The specific synaptic proteins identified could potentially be targeted to halt synaptic dysfunction in AD.
