### Title
TENT5 cytoplasmic non-canonical poly(A) polymerases regulate the innate immune response in animals

### Description
Innate immunity, the first line of host defense against pathogens, is tightly regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Here, through global transcriptome and proteome analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncover a modulation of the expression of secreted innate immunity effector proteins by TENT5, one of a recently described family of cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases. Direct RNA sequencing revealed that TENT-5 polyadenylates mRNAs with signal peptide-encoding sequences, that are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of tent-5 function makes worms more susceptible to bacterial infection. Importantly, we demonstrate that the function of TENT-5 in innate immunity is evolutionarily conserved, as its orthologs, TENT5A and TENT5C are induced during macrophage activation and polyadenylate mRNAs, some of which are of genes orthologous to C. elegans TENT-5 targets. In summary, our study reveals cytoplasmic polyadenylation to be a previously unknown component of the post-transcriptional regulation of innate immunity in animals.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation was done based on modified FASP protocol  (Wisniewski 2011, dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr200019m) Briefly supernatant was placed at Vivacon 30kDa filter, centrifuge and wash3 times with 200ul 8M Urea in 100mM NH4HCO3. Reduced (DTT, RT, 30min) and alkylated (IAA, RT, 15min). Digested overnight with Trypsin (Promega), acidify with TFA to final concertation 0.1%. MS analysis was performed by LC-MS in the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry (IBB PAS, Warsaw) using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated by a 180-min linear gradient of 95% solution A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 35% solution B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). The measurement of each sample was preceded by three washing runs to avoid cross-contamination; the final MS washing run was searched for the presence of cross-contamination between samples. If the protein of interest was identified in the washing run and in the next measured sample at the same or smaller intensity, then the sample was regard as contaminated and these samples were excluded from final graphs. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data- dependent MS-MS2 mode and data were acquired in the m/z range of 300â€“2000.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed with the MaxQuant (Version 1.6.3.4) platform. The reference proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans database from UniProt was used (27805 protein entries) and common contaminates list included in MaxQuant. Settings: match between runs, variable modification: oxidation (M), 4.5 ppm error tolerance. Label-Free-Quantification (LFQ) intensity values were calculated using the MaxLFQ algorithm to estimate quantities of identified proteins and identified proteins were analyzed as follows. Scafold4 Q+S platform was used for statistical analysis. Whitheny- Mann test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections was performed.

### Publication Abstract
Osteoblasts orchestrate bone formation through the secretion of type I collagen and other constituents of the matrix on which hydroxyapatite crystals mineralize. Here, we show that TENT5A, whose mutations were found in congenital bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta patients, is a cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase playing a crucial role in regulating bone mineralization. Direct RNA sequencing revealed that TENT5A is induced during osteoblast differentiation and polyadenylates mRNAs encoding Col1&#x3b1;1, Col1&#x3b1;2, and other secreted proteins involved in osteogenesis, increasing their expression. We postulate that TENT5A, possibly together with its paralog TENT5C, is responsible for the wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs encoding secreted proteins occurring during bone mineralization. Importantly, the Tent5a knockout (KO) mouse line displays bone fragility and skeletal hypomineralization phenotype resulting from quantitative and qualitative collagen defects. Thus, we report a biologically relevant posttranscriptional regulator of collagen production and, more generally, bone formation.
