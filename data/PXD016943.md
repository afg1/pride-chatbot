### Title
Nematostella toxins expression under stress

### Description
Changes in Nematostella vectensis proteome expression were analyzed in 2 different Nematostella populations along the east coast of USA in different stress conditions vrs. normal growth temperature.

### Sample Protocol
Animals were treat with combined stress conditions, were frozen in liquis nitrogen and lyzed in 8M Urea and 400mM Ammonium bicarbonate.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra data were processed using the MaxQuant computaional platform, version 1.5.3.12. Peak lists were searched against translated coding sequences of gene models from N. vectensis
