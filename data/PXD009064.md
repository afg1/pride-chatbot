### Title
LC-MSMS of the EL4 MHC class I, immunopeptidome

### Description
MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

### Sample Protocol
Three biological replicates of 250 x 10^6 exponentially growing cells were prepared for EL4 cells (cell culture medium: RPMI 1640/HEPES supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% sodium-pyruvate, all purchased from Gibco). MHC I-associated peptides were obtained by mild acid elution using, per replicate, 2.5ml of citrate buffer at pH 3.3 (0.131M citric acid / 0.066M Na2HPO4, 150mM NaCl) containing aprotinin and iodoacetamide (1:100). Peptides were then desalted on an Oasis HLB cartridge (30 mg, Waters) and filtered on a 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Amicon Ultra-4, Millipore) to remove b2m proteins. After being dried using a Speed-Vac, peptides were re-suspended in 0.2 % formic acid, loaded on a home-made C18 pre-column (5 mm x 360 um i.d. packed with C18 Jupiter Phenomenex) and separated on a home-made C18 analytical column (15 cm x 150 um i.d. packed with C18 Jupiter Phenomenex) with a 56-min gradient from 0–40 % acetonitrile (0.2 % formic acid) and a 600 nl/min flow rate on a nEasy-LC II system connected to a Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each full MS spectrum acquired with a 70,000 resolution was followed by 12 MS/MS spectra, where the most abundant multiply charged ions were selected for  MS/MS sequencing with a resolution of 17,500, an automatic gain control target of 1e6, an injection time of 50 ms and a collision energy of 25 %.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the EL4 global cancer database that was built using EL4 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCm38.87, total number of proteins in database: 2,189,276). For peptide identification, tolerance was set at 10 ppm and 0.01 Da for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Occurrence of oxidation (M) and deamidation (NQ) were considered as post-translational modifications.

### Publication Abstract
Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) represent ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy, but few have been identified thus far. We therefore developed a proteogenomic approach to enable the high-throughput discovery of TSAs coded by potentially all genomic regions. In two murine cancer cell lines and seven human primary tumors, we identified a total of 40 TSAs, about 90% of which derived from allegedly noncoding regions and would have been missed by standard exome-based approaches. Moreover, most of these TSAs derived from nonmutated yet aberrantly expressed transcripts (such as endogenous retroelements) that could be shared by multiple tumor types. Last, we demonstrated that, in mice, the strength of antitumor responses after TSA vaccination was influenced by two parameters that can be estimated in humans and could serve for TSA prioritization in clinical studies: TSA expression and the frequency of TSA-responsive T cells in the preimmune repertoire. In conclusion, the strategy reported herein could considerably facilitate the identification and prioritization of actionable human TSAs.
