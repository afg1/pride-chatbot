### Title
Curated cauldrons: Preserved proteins from early copper alloy vessels illuminate feasting practices in the steppe

### Description
Analysis of residues from ancient Maykop cauldrons to examine food preparation and serving traditions.

### Sample Protocol
We extracted proteins in a clean laboratory and analysed the peptides on an LC-MS/MS (Q-Exactive).

### Data Protocol
Resulting raw data files were converted to MGF files and searched the data with Mascot. After searching, data were filtered according to E-value and PSM counts.

### Publication Abstract
Large metal and metal-alloy cauldrons first appear on the far western steppe and Caucasus region during the Maykop period (3700-2900 BCE); however, the types of foods or beverages cooked in and served from these vessels have remained mysterious. Here, we present proteomic analysis of nine residues from copper-alloy cauldrons from Maykop burial contexts where we identify muscle, blood, and milk proteins specific to domesticated, and possibly wild, ruminants. This study clearly demonstrates that the earliest, large-volume feasting vessels contained both primary and secondary animal products, likely prepared in the form of a stew.
