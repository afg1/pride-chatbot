### Title
Lysine-specific acetylated proteome fromion in Thermococcus gammatolerans

### Description
This report provides the first data set of lysine-specific acetylated proteomeion fromin Thermococcus. gammatolerans obtained using an immunoaffinity approach coupled with nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 339 acetylation sites in 181 proteins, accounting for 8.3% of the total proteins in this archaeon. For the first time in the archaea domain the data revealed the presence of acetylated histones.

### Sample Protocol
T. gammatolerans protein extracts were prepared by sonication in presence of inhibitors and in solution proteolyzed with trypsin after microwave denaturation of the hyperthermophilic and trypsin recalcitrant proteins. Acetylated peptides were enriched from the resulting peptide pools using anti-acetyllysine antibodies and further analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS with a LTQ-Orbitrap XL high-resolution mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were interpreted with MASCOT Daemon search engine against T. gammatolerans strain EJ3 and T. kodakarensis database respectively. The results were then parsed with IRMA.
