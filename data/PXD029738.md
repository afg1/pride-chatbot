### Title
HEK293T_The Label-free DIA-MS nanoproteomics workflow based on empirically corrected spectral library and application for 5000 PBMCs stimulated by LPS

### Description
A refined HEK293T peptide dilution series acquired in DIA mode on Orbitrap Lumos.

### Sample Protocol
We employed three software tools (DIA-NN, Spectronaut, and EncyclopeDIA) for data analysis and generated three types of libraries, including an experiment-specific library built by DDA analysis of off-line fractions, a FASTA sequence database, and a library generated by gas-phase fractionation (GPF), resulting in eight analysis pipelines. Then we systematically compared the performance of the eight strategies by analyzing the DIA data from HEK293T cell tryptic peptides with sample loads of 500 ng, 100 ng, 20 ng, and 4 ng.

### Data Protocol
DDA spectral library was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.3 and MSFragger(v13.0).Three software tools including DIA-NN(v01/10/2020), Spectronaut(v14.9.201124.47784) and EncyclopeDIA (v0.9.5) were used for extracting peptide signal from row files using the generated spectral library by DDA or GPF or searching against FASTA file from Swiss human protein database (released in September 2020) containing 20375 sequence entries. Spectronaut were used by the spectral library from high-pH fractionated tryptic digest of HEK293T measured in DDA mode on Orbitrap Lumos and FASTA-based approaches. For DIA-NN and EncyclopeDIA, DDA-based, FASTA-based and GPF-based spectral library were used for DIA data searching.
