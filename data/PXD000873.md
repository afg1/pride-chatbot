### Title
Analyses of the Xylem Sap Proteomes Identified Candidate Fusarium virguliforme Proteinacious Toxins

### Description
Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is caused by the ascomycete fungus, Fusarium virguliforme. The pathogen secretes one or more toxins into the infected soybean roots to cause foliar SDS.  This study investigated if the xylem sap of F. virguliforme-infected soybean plants contains secreted F. virguliforme-proteins, some of which could be involved in foliar SDS development.

### Sample Protocol
Xylem sap samples and the cell-free F. virguliforme culture filtrate were analyzed by nano LC-ESI/MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
All raw data were searched using Mascot 2.2 (Matrix Science) software against the NCBI public database with taxonomy of Green Plants or the F. virguliforme genome sequence database containing 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes (http://fvgbrowse.agron.iastate.edu).
