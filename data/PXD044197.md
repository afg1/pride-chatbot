### Title
Mapping three-dimensional intratumor proteomic heterogeneity in uterine serous carcinoma by multiregion microsampling

### Description
Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) represents only a small proportion of all uterine cancer cases, but patients with this aggressive subtype typically have high rates of chemotherapy resistance, disease recurrence, and constitute a disproportionately high percentage of the deaths. Improving the clinical management of USC is predicated by better characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the molecular features driving disease pathology. To improve our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) within the USC TME, we investigated proteome and transcriptome alterations in spatially resolved laser microdissection (LMD) enriched cellular subpopulations from nine USC patient tumor tissue specimens. LMD enriched samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), reverse phase protein microarray (RPPA), and targeted RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).

### Sample Protocol
Subpopulations of enriched tumor epithelium, enriched tumor-involved stroma, and whole “bulk” tissue were harvested via laser microdissection (LMD) from spatially resolved levels from nine USC patient specimens and analyzed by mass spectrometry, reverse phase protein array, and RNA-sequencing. LMD tissues were pressure-assisted, trypsin-digested employing a barocycler and peptides were labeled with Tandem Mass Tags (TMTpro 16plex). Multiplexed samples were offline fractionated and pooled into 24 fractions which were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a nanoflow LC system (EASY-nLC 1200) coupled online with a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Global protein-level abundances were generated from peptide spectral matches identified by searching .raw data files against a publicly available, non-redundant human proteome database (http://www.uniprot.org/, SwissProt, Homo sapiens, downloaded 12-01-2017) using Mascot (Matrix Science, v2.6.0), Proteome Discoverer (v2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and in-house tools. Quan correction was applied to all reagent ion abundances using TMTpro16 reagent lot UL297970. Differential analysis of proteins was performed using limma (version 3.8) and proteins passing with an adjusted p<0.05 and exhibiting the same pattern of expression across all 9 patients were prioritized for downstream analyses using a variety of tools including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA).
