### Title
Peptidomics of Human Hypothalamic neurons

### Description
The study of peptide secretion, and identifying its control requires the use of ELISAs for measuring their levels pre and post stimulation. In place of ELISA's an LC-MS methdology was developed first to identify the correct peptides generated by the neurons, which could then be used to measure the peptide products by targetted LC-MS analysis. The Extraction was also performed on human hypothalamic tissue obtained from a tissue bank. Samples were analysed by nano LC-MS, and searched using Peaks 8.5.

### Sample Protocol
Peptides were extracted from neuronal stem cells using GuHCL, with three freeze thaw cycles. The samples were then precipitated with 80% ACN in water, and the aqueous layer removed and evaporated to dryness. The pellet was reconstituted and subjected to reduction / alkylation prior to LC-MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
PEAKS 8.5 was used to search the data, using a no-digest setting, and with Carbamidomethyl fixed modification, N-terminal pyroglutamate, N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amide variable modifications
