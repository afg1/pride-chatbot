### Title
Alterations in kernel proteome after infection with Fusarium culmorum in two triticale cultivars with contrasting resistance to Fusarium head blight

### Description
Triticale was used as a model to recognize new components of molecular mechanism of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereals. Fusarium-damaged kernels of two lines distinct in levels of resistance to FHB were applied into a proteome profiling using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to create protein maps and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins differentially accumulated between the analyzed lines. The 2-DE analysis indicated a total of 23 spots with clear differences in a protein content between the more resistant and more susceptible triticale lines after infection with F. culmorum. A majority of the proteins were involved in a cell carbohydrate metabolism, stressing the importance of this protein group in a plant response to Fusarium infection. The increased accumulation levels of different isoforms of plant beta-amylase were observed for a more susceptible triticale line after inoculation. The more resistant line was characterized by a higher abundance of alpha-amylase inhibitor CM2 subunit.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted as described by Hurkman and Tanaka (1986) and their concentrantion in samples estimated using 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). In isoelectrofocusing (IEF), strip gels with linear pH range 4-7 (24 cm) were used to focus 500 μg of proteins extracted from 25 mg of triticale flour. In the second dimension (sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)  the proteins were separated using 13 % polyacrylamide gels (1.5 × 255 × 196 mm). The gels were stained with colloidal coomassie brilliant blue G-250 as described by Neuhoff et al. (1988), scanned by Image scanner III (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and subjected to Lab scan 6.0 program (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) processing. The image analysis was performed with Image Master 2-D Platinum software (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The abundance of each protein spot was normalized as a relative volume (% Vol) and calculated as a ratio of the volume of particular spot to the total volume of all the spots present on the gel. The protein spots which showed at least  two fold differences (p≤0.05) in protein content between two analyzed lines were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to the Orbitrap Velos type mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA USA), working in the regime of data dependent MS to MS/MS switch.

### Data Protocol
The data was analyzed with Mascot Distiller software (version 2.3, MatrixScience London, UK) with standard settings for the Orbitrap low resolution measurements (available at http://www.matrixscience.com/distiller.html) to extract MS/MS peak-lists from the raw files. The obtained fragmentation spectra were matched to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database (57412064 sequences; 20591031683 residues), with a Viridiplantae filter (2874321 sequences) using the Mascot search engine (Mascot Daemon v. 2.3.0, Mascot Server v. 2.4.0, MatrixScience, London, UK).

### Publication Abstract
Highlight: The level of pathogen alpha-amylase and plant beta-amylase activities could be components of plant-pathogen interaction associated with the resistance of triticale to Fusarium head blight. Triticale was used here as a model to recognize new components of molecular mechanism of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereals. Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) of two lines distinct in levels of resistance to FHB were applied into a proteome profiling using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to create protein maps and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the proteins differentially accumulated between the analyzed lines. This proteomic research was supported by a measurement of alpha- and beta-amylase activities, mycotoxin content, and fungal biomass in the analyzed kernels. The 2-DE analysis indicated a total of 23 spots with clear differences in a protein content between the more resistant and more susceptible triticale lines after infection with Fusarium culmorum. A majority of the proteins were involved in a cell carbohydrate metabolism, stressing the importance of this protein group in a plant response to Fusarium infection. The increased accumulation levels of different isoforms of plant beta-amylase were observed for a more susceptible triticale line after inoculation but these were not supported by a total level of beta-amylase activity, showing the highest value in the control conditions. The more resistant line was characterized by a higher abundance of alpha-amylase inhibitor CM2 subunit and simultaneously a lower activity of alpha-amylase after inoculation. We suggest that the level of pathogen alpha-amylase and plant beta-amylase activities could be components of plant-pathogen interaction associated with the resistance of triticale to FHB.
