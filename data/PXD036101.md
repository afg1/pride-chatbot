### Title
N‑Glycoproteomics Study of Putative N‑Glycoprotein Biomarkers  of Drug Resistance in MCF‑7/ADR Cells

### Description
Currently, drug resistance of anti-cancer therapy has become the main cause of low survival rate and poor prognosis. Full  understanding of drug resistance mechanisms is an urgent request for further development of anti-cancer therapy and improvement of prognosis. Here we present our N-glycoproteomics study of putative N-glycoprotein biomarkers of drug resistance  in doxorubicin resistance breast cancer cell line michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7/ADR) relative to parental michigan  cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. Intact N-glycopeptides (IDs) from MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells were enriched with  zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC), labeled with stable isotopic diethylation (SIDE),  and analyzed with C18-RPLC-MS/MS (HCD with stepped normalized collision energies); these IDs were identifed with  database search engine GPSeeker, and the diferentially expressed intact N-glycopeptides (DEGPs) were quantifed with  GPSeekerQuan. With target-decoy searches and control of spectrum-level FDR≤1%, 322 intact N-glycopeptides were  identifed; these intact N-glycopeptides come from the combination of 249 unique peptide backbones (corresponding to 234  intact N-glycoproteins) and 90 monosaccharide compositions (corresponding to 248 putative N-glycosites). The sequence  structures of 165 IDs were confrmed with structure-diagnostic fragment ions. With the criteria of observation at least twice  among the three technical replicates,≥1.5-fold change and p value<0.05, 20 DEGPs were quantifed, where fve of them  were up-regulated and 15 of them were down-regulated; the corresponding intact N-glycoproteins as putative markers of  drug resistance were discussed.

### Sample Protocol
Cell Culture of MCF‑7 and MCF‑7/ADR Cells，Sample Preparation of Intact N‑Glycopeptides，C18‑RPLC‑MS/MS (HCD) Analysis

### Data Protocol
The raw datasets from RPLC-MS/MS analysis were processed with the database search engine GPSeeker, which  was reported in detail elsewhere (Xiao and Tian 2019b),  and only a brief description is given here. Before searching, four customized databases including light diethylation  in forward direction (LF), light diethylation in decoy direction (LR), heavy diethylation in forward direction (HF) and  heavy diethylation in decoy direction (HR) were created, and  each raw data fle was searched against all the four databases  independently. Isotopic peak abundance cutof (IPACO, %),  isotopic peak abundance deviation (IPAD, %) and isotopic  peak m/z deviation (IPMD, ppm) were set as 40%, 50% and  20 ppm, respectively, for the search of both the precursor and  fragment ions. For output of intact N-glycopeptide spectrum  matches (GPSMs), additional parameters were: percentage  of matched fragment ions of the peptide backbone≥10%
