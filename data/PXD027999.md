### Title
Degradation of misfolded HLA B*2704 (associated with disease) involves UPR, autophagy and aggresomes whereas degradation of  HLA B*2709 (non-associated with disease) involves the endosomal-lysosomal pathway

### Description
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) belongs to a group of diseases, called spondyloarthropathies (SpA), which are strongly associated with the genetic marker, HLA-B27. AS is characterized by inflammation of joints, and primarily affects the spine. Over 200 subtypes of HLA B27 are known, owing to high polymorphism. Some are strongly associated with disease (e.g., B*2704) whereas others are rarely associated (e.g., B*2709). Misfolding of HLA-B27 molecules [as dimers, or as high molecular weight (HMW) oligomers] is one of several hypotheses proposed. Our group has previously established the existence of HMW species of HLA-B27 in AS patients. Still, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying differences in pathogenic outcomes of different HLA-B27 subtypes. We conducted a proteomics-based evaluation of the differential disease association of HLA B*2704 and B*2709, using stable transfectants of genes encoding the two proteins.

### Sample Protocol
1 µg of tryptic peptides of each sample were analysed using Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to EASY-nLC 1200 system equipped with nano electrospray ion source. Peptides were resolved on nano-LC reverse phase column (75 μm ID x 25 cm, packed with PepMap 2 μm- C18 particles) for 95 min with a gradient of 5-45 % acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. MS1 survey scans were performed with resolution of 120000 and a mass range of 375-1600 m/z, on the Orbitrap. Peptides with charge state 2-5 were sampled for MS2. Following HCD activation, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode. MS was operated in data dependent acquisition mode using 30% HCD collision energy and AGC target of 5.0e5. Lock mass option was enabled for polydimethylcyclosiloxane (PCM) ions (m/z = 445.120025) for internal recalibration during the run.

### Data Protocol
The raw files generated were used for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Austria) by searching against a standard Homo sapiens database from UniprotKB Homo sapiens database UP000005640 using Sequest HT search engine with 20289  sequences. Sequest HT search criteria included tryptic cleavage with two missed cleavages, a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Minimum peptide length was set at 6 and maximum peptide length was 144.  Search criteria also included carbamidomethylation of cysteines as static modification, and oxidation of methionine as dynamic modification. Default settings were used for other parameters. Protein identification and quantitative analysis used more than two unique peptides; FDR of less than 1% and p-values < 0.05 were required for relative quantification.
