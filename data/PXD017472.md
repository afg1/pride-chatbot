### Title
Proteins identification using proteomics

### Description
This project was to use the proteomics approach to compare serum proteins of mouse and human origin.

### Sample Protocol
Sera from healthy and hyperglycemic humans and mice were collected. The protein samples were digested with trypsin and then labeled with different iTraq tags. Four samples from humans and mice were combined respectively, and fractionated separately via strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX). After drying, the fractions were dissolved for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The relative protein expression ratio and the protein peptides were analyzed using Mascot software. All tandem mass spectra were searched for humans and mice against the International Protein Index database.
