### Title
N-linked glycosylation of recombinant soluble ectodomain of HKU1 haemagglutinin esterase

### Description
Coronaviruses (CoVs) encompass many human pathogens such as HKU-1, OC43, NL63, SARS, MERS and, most recently, nCoV-2019. The spike (S) protein of CoVs has received much attention for its role in host tropism and immunity, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) also plays an important role in host adaptation by determining host receptor (sialic acid) specificity. We determined the structure of HKU1 HE by cryo electron microscopy and mapped site-specific N-linked glycosylation by LC-MS/MS of glycopeptides using electron transfer high-energy collision dissociation.

### Sample Protocol
9 microgram of CoV-HKU1 HE were incubated in 100mM Tris pH 8.5, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 10mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 40mM iodoacetamide at 95Â°C for ten minutes and at 25°C for 30 minutes in the dark. Denatured, reduced, and alkylated CoV-HKU1 HE (3 microgram) was then diluted into fresh 50mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight at 37°C either with 0.056 microgram of trypsin (Promega), chymotrypsin (Sigma Aldrich) or alpha lytic protease (Sigma). Formic acid was then added to a final concentration of 2% and the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, followed by another round of centrifugation for 5 min to precipitate the sodium deoxycholate and collect the peptides from the supernatants. Then, the CoV-HKU1 HE tryptic, chymotryptic and alpha lytic protease digests were desalted using 30 µm Oasis HLB 96-well plate (Waters). The Oasis HLB sorbent was activated with 100% acetonitrile and subsequently equilibrated with 10% formic acid in water. Next, peptides were bound to the sorbent, washed twice with 10% formic acid in water and eluted with 100 µL of 50% acetonitrile/5%formic acid (v/v). The eluted peptides were vacuum-dried and resuspended in 100 µL of 2% formic acid in water. Six microliter of resuspended peptides for the glycoform identification and two microliter two-fold diluted peptides for the glycoform quantification were run on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) mass spectrometer coupled to nanospray UHPLC system Agilent 1290 (Agilent Technologies) in duplicates. A 90-min LC gradient from 0% to 35% acetonitrile was used to separate peptides at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. A Poroshell 120 EC C18 (50 cm x 75 µm, 2.7 µm, Agilent Technologies) analytical column and a ReproSil-Pur C18 (2 cm x 100 µm, 3 µm, Dr. Maisch) trap column were used for the peptide separation. The data was acquired in data-dependent mode. Orbitrap Fusion parameters for the full scan MS spectra were as follows: an AGC target of 4x10^5 at 60 000 resolution, scan range 350-2000 m/z, Orbitrap maximum injection time 50 ms. Ten most intense ions (2+ to 8+ ions) were subjected to fragmentation with electron-transfer/higher energy collision dissociation ion fragmentation scheme (Frese et al., 2013). The supplemental higher energy collision dissociation energy was set at 30%. The MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30 000 with an AGC target of 5x10^5, maximum injection time 250 ms, scan range 120-4000 m/z and dynamic exclusion of 16 s

### Data Protocol
The acquired data was analyzed using Byonic (Bern et al., 2012) against a custom database of recombinant CoV-HKU1 HE protein and used proteases, searching for glycan modifications with 12/24 ppm search windows for MS1/MS2, respectively. Up to three missed cleavages were permitted using C-terminal cleavage at R/K for trypsin, F/Y/W/M/L for chymotrypsin and T/A/S/V for alpha lytic protease. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable common 1, glycan modifications as variable common 2, allowing up to max. 2 variable common parameters per one peptide. The custom N-linked glycan database was used for the searches. All reported glycopeptides in the Byonic result files were manually inspected for quality of fragment assignments. All glycopeptide identifications were merged into a single non-redundant list per sequon. Glycans were classified based on HexNAc content as high-mannose (2 HexNAc), hybrid (3 HexNAc) or complex (> 3 HexNAc). Byonic search results were exported to mzIdentML format to build a spectral library in Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010) and extract peak areas for individual glycoforms from MS1 scans. The full database of variable N-linked glycan modifications from Byonic was manually added to the Skyline project file in XML format. Reported peak areas were pooled based on the number of HexNAc, Fuc or NeuAc residues to distinguish high-mannose/hybrid/complex glycosylation, fucosylation and sialylation, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
The human betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus) arose from separate zoonotic introductions, OC43 relatively recently and HKU1 apparently much longer ago. Embecovirus particles contain two surface projections called spike&#xa0;(S) and haemagglutinin-esterase&#xa0;(HE), with S mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion, and HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Together, they promote dynamic virion attachment to glycan-based receptors, specifically 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the ~80&#x2009;kDa, heavily glycosylated HKU1 HE at 3.4&#x2009;&#xc5; resolution. Comparison with existing HE structures reveals a drastically truncated lectin domain, incompatible with sialic acid binding, but with the structure and function of the esterase domain left intact. Cryo-EM and mass spectrometry analysis reveals a putative glycan shield on the now redundant lectin domain. The findings further our insight into the evolution and host adaptation of human embecoviruses, and demonstrate the utility of cryo-EM for studying small, heavily glycosylated proteins.
