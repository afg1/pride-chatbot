### Title
Proteomics of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii

### Description
Here, we present the proteome characterization of Dickeya dadantii by shotgun proteomics (Data Dependent acquisition, DDA mode).

### Sample Protocol
Bacteria were growth on LB medium (control, 0H), and exposed on endives for 24h, 48h and 72h. The proteomic discovery was operated in DDA mode (QExactive, ThermoFisher). Peptides separation was performed with two columns in series during 120 min (Aeris Peptide™ 3.6 um Core shell).

### Data Protocol
Raw DDA data files were converted to mzXML and searched using Protein Prospector (version 5.17.0) against the Dickeya dadantii 3937 Uniprot database (4500 entries non reviewed) allowing for variable oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation and pyroglutamate. Label-free quantification measurements were extracted from the raw data by “MS1 filtering” tool algorithm of Skyline software (http://proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/skyline). Spectral libraries containing identified peptides and retention time were created from the raw data converted to mzXML file (MassMatrix Mass Spectrometric Data File conversion Tool version 3.9) and search in Protein Prospector (converted into a pep.XML file with Protein Prospector version v5.10.0).

### Publication Abstract
Targeted mass spectrometry of a surrogate peptide panel is a powerful method to study the dynamics of protein networks, but chromatographic time scheduling remains a major limitation for dissemination and implementation of robust and large multiplexed assays. We unveil a Multiple Reaction Monitoring method (Scout-MRM) where the use of spiked scout peptides triggers complex transition lists, regardless of the retention time of targeted surrogate peptides. The interest of Scout-MRM method regarding the retention time independency, multiplexing capability, reproducibility, and putative interest in facilitating method transfer was illustrated by a 782-peptide-plex relative assay targeting 445 proteins of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii during plant infection.
