### Title
LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis of Panc-1 EVs isolated using SEC

### Description
LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis of Panc-1 EVs isolated using SEC

### Sample Protocol
EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. Samples were lyzed in 2% deoxycholate, 25mM Tris-HCl pH 7 and 2X HALT Proteins were reduced with TCEP, alkylated with iodoacetamide, digested overnight with trypsin Peptides were separated on a Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (C18 column) and analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid operated in data dependent acquisition mode.

### Data Protocol
Spectra were processed in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 and searched against a Homo sapiens database using Mascot 2.6.0.

### Publication Abstract
Biofluid-accessible extracellular vesicles (EVs) may represent a new means to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting disease. However, current methods to isolate EVs encounter challenges when they are used to select specific populations. Moreover, it has been difficult to comprehensively characterize heterogeneous EV populations at the single vesicle level. Here, we robustly assessed heterogeneous EV populations from cultured cell lines via nanoparticle tracking analysis, proteomics, transcriptomics, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative single molecule localization microscopy (qSMLM). Using qSMLM, we quantified the size and biomarker content of individual EVs. We applied qSMLM to patient plasma samples and identified a pancreatic cancer-enriched EV population. Our goal is to advance single molecule characterization of EVs for early disease detection. <b>Abbreviations</b>: EV: Extracellular Vesicle; qSMLM: quantitative Single Molecule Localization Microscopy; PDAC: Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor 1; CA19-9: carbohydrate antigen 19-9; SEC: size exclusion chromatography; WGA: wheat germ agglutinin; AF647: Alexa Fluor 647; Ab: antibody; HPDEC: Healthy Pancreatic Ductal Epithelial Cell; TEM: Transmission Electron Microscopy.
