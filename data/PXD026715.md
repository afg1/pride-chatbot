### Title
COPI membrane interactome by ultraID-MS

### Description
Analysis of a membrane-bound COPI interactome by comparing  gammaCOP-ultraID datasets with or without incubation with brefeldin A (POI = gamma1COP or gamma2COP, control protein = Ago2). Three biological replicates per condition.

### Sample Protocol
Samples are lysates of P19 cells expressing ultraID fusion proteins after PDB. Biotinylated proteins were isolated on trypsin-resistant streptavidin beads and then trypsin-digested on beads. The digested peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS on an orbitrap instrument

### Data Protocol
RAW data were processed with the MaxQuant software, standard setting, NO match between runs, with LFQ algorithm

### Publication Abstract
Proximity-dependent biotinylation (PDB) combined with mass spectrometry analysis has established itself as a key technology to study protein-protein interactions in living cells. A widespread approach, BioID, uses an abortive variant of the E. coli BirA biotin protein ligase, a quite bulky enzyme with slow labeling kinetics. To improve PDB versatility and speed, various enzymes have been developed by different approaches. Here we present a small-size engineered enzyme: ultraID. We show its practical use to probe the interactome of Argonaute-2 after a 10&#x2009;min labeling pulse and expression at physiological levels. Moreover, using ultraID, we provide a membrane-associated interactome of coatomer, the coat protein complex of COPI vesicles. To date, ultraID is the smallest and most efficient biotin ligase available for PDB and offers the possibility of investigating interactomes at a high temporal resolution.
