### Title
Inducible degradation-coupled phosphoproteomics identifies PP2A-Rts1 as a novel eisosome regulator

### Description
We developed and validated a workflow in S. cerevisiae combining auxin-inducible protein degradation with LC-MS/MS phosphoproteomics and used it to identify candidate phosphatase substrates during mitosis, when kinase activity is high. Our results revealed that PP2A-Rts1 influences dephosphorylation of numerous proteins in mitosis, including multiple subunits of the plasma membrane-associated eisosome complex. 

### Sample Protocol
Please refer to manuscipt for specific details. For most experiments, whole cell protein extracts were digested with trypsin under denaturing conditions, followed by chemical dimethyl labeling, strong cation exchange prefractionation, phosphopeptide enrichment and C18 reverse phase fractionation.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed using MaxQuant, Perseus, GraphPad Prism, Excel, and in-house R-scripts
