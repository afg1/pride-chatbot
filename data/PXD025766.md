### Title
The use of linear ion traps in data independent acquisition methods benefits low-input proteomics

### Description
Here we revisited the use of linear ion traps mass analyzers in DIA methods to evaluate their potential to boost peptide and protein identifications in low input and single-cell proteomics applications

### Sample Protocol
Serial dilutions of commercially available HeLa protein digest analyzed in a 50-cm nano-LC column (PepMap RSLC C18, Thermo Scientific) for liquid chromatography separation (120-min gradient), and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis with an EASY-nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. All data independent acquisition methods tested in this study had their precursor peptides ions analyzed in a high accuracy/high resolution orbitrap mass analyzer, whereas fragment ions generated by HCD fragmentation (NCE 28) were analyzed either in an orbitrap or a linear ion trap mass analyzer.

### Data Protocol
All data were acquired with Xcalibur software. DIA raw files were processed with Spectronaut v14.7 using a directDIA strategy .
