### Title
Inhibition of inflammatory mediators by sugarcane ethanol extracts revealed by proteomics

### Description
Proteomic profiling of inflamed SW480 cells in response to sugarcane fibre ethanol extract treatment

### Sample Protocol
Cell lines were lysed, reduced (DTT), alkylated (IAA), digested with trypsin and profiled by LC-SWATH using an in-house spectral library generated by basic reversed phase fractionation followed by LC-MS/MS (13 fractions).

### Data Protocol
In-house generated spectral library (.txt) was imported into PeakView 2.1 with SWATH 2.0. Only non-shared and unmodified peptides (confidence >= 99%) were extracted and protein areas used for cell line assessment. Perseus 2.5 was used for further data analysis.
