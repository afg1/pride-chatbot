### Title
Draft of the mitochondrial landscape, OM/IM

### Description
The mitochondrial subcompartment proteomes revealed by quantitative MS.

### Sample Protocol
Yeast were grown on SILAC media (heavy Arg10, Lys8 / light. Mitochondria were purified according to Sickmann et al, PNAS 2003. Highly purified mitochondria (heavy and light). Outer mitochondrial membrane vesicles (OMV) were isolated by osmotic swelling, followed by two ultracentrifugation steps (Zahedi et al, Mol Biol Cell 2006). Total membranes were isolated by sonication followed by ultracentrifugation. Light/Heavy OMV and total membranes were mixed in three different ratios, and OMV/Total ratios were determined based on SILAC ratios. Therefore, samples were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive Plus.

### Data Protocol
SILAC samples were individually analyzed using MaxQuant and the SGD database, generating 3 quantitative datasets which were used to determine protein distributions between total and outer mitochondrial membranes.

### Publication Abstract
The mitochondrial proteome comprises ~1000 (yeast)-1500 (human) different proteins, which are distributed into four different subcompartments. The sublocalization of these proteins within the organelle in most cases remains poorly defined. Here we describe an integrated approach combining stable isotope labeling, various protein enrichment and extraction strategies and quantitative mass spectrometry to produce a quantitative map of submitochondrial protein distribution in S. cerevisiae. This quantitative landscape enables a proteome-wide classification of 986 proteins into soluble, peripheral, and integral mitochondrial membrane proteins, and the assignment of 818 proteins into the four subcompartments: outer membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space, or matrix. We also identified 206 proteins that were not previously annotated as localized to mitochondria. Furthermore, the protease Prd1, misannotated as intermembrane space protein, could be re-assigned and characterized as a presequence peptide degrading enzyme in the matrix.Protein localization plays an important role in the regulation of cellular physiology. Here the authors use an integrated proteomics approach to localize proteins to the mitochondria and provide a detailed map of their specific localization within the organelle.
