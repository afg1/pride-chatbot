### Title
Effects of abolishing Whi2 on the proteome and nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive protein production - Proteomics of P1 and P1-whi2 strains in SCCSH and SCME liquid media.

### Description
The associated files are mass spec data of proteins from liquid cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae P1 and P1-whi2 strains.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were harvested from S. cerevisiae P1 and P1-whi2 strains grown 1 hr in SCCSH or 1 and 6 hrs in SCME media. The cells were disrupted in 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), 10mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 50 mM chloroacetamide buffer containing 2% sodium deoxycholate using glass beads. Protein aliquots (30 µg per sample; determined by bicinchoninic acid assay, Sigma) were used for MS sample preparation. Peptide (2 µg) from each sample was separated on Nano reversed phase columns (EASY-Spray column a 50-cm x 75 m ID, PepMap C18, 2 m particles using a 1 h elution gradient and analyzed in DDA mode on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. Three biological replicates were run for each strain and condition.

### Data Protocol
Resulting raw files were processed in MaxQuant (v. 1.5.8.3). Searches were performed against the latest version of S. cerevisiae Uniprot database and common contaminant database
