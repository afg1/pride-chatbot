### Title
The Q Exactive HF, a Benchtop Mass Spectrometer with a Pre-filter, High Performance Quadrupole and an Ultra-High Field Orbitrap Analyzer

### Description
The quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) has made a powerful proteomics instrument available in a benchtop format. It significantly boosted analyzable proteins per hour and has now evolved into a proteomics analysis workhorse for many laboratories. Here we describe the Q Exactive Plus and Q Exactive HF mass spectrometers, which feature several innovations in comparison to the original Q Exactive instrument. A low resolution pre-filter has been implemented within the injection flatapole, preventing unwanted ions from entering deep into the system, and thereby increasing its robustness. A new segmented quadrupole, with higher fidelity of isolation efficiency over a wide range of isolation windows, provides an almost two-fold improvement of transmission at narrow isolation widths. Additionally, the Q Exactive HF has a compact Orbitrap analyzer, leading to higher field strength and almost doubling resolution at the same transient times. With its very fast isolation and fragmentation capabilities, the instrument achieves overall cycle times of 1 s for a top 15 to 20 HCD (Higher energy Collisional Dissociation) method. We demonstrate identification of 5,000 proteins in standard 90-min gradients of tryptic digests of mammalian cell lysate, an increase of over 40% for detected peptides and over 20% for detected proteins. Additionally, we tested the instrument on peptide phosphorylation enriched samples, for which an improvement of up to 60% class I sites was observed.

### Sample Protocol
HeLa cells (ATCC, S3 subclone) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 min, washed once with cold PBS and centrifuged again. Supernatant was carefully discarded and cell pellets shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C. Aliquots of approximately 3e7 cells were re-suspended in 1 ml water, then 1 ml trifluoroethanol (TFE) was added and incubated for 10 min on ice, a 2 min sonication at duty cycle 30% and output control 3 (Branson Ultrasonics sonifier; model 250) and 1 min vortexing. After 20 min incubation at 56 C, 25 ul of DTT 200 mM was added to reduce proteins and samples were incubated at 90 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C for 15 min. Alkylation was then performed by adding 100 ul of IAA 200 mM and incubated 60 min at room temperature in the dark. 25 ul of DTT 200 mM were added and after incubation for 15 min at room temperature the sample was diluted using 8 ml of NH4HCO3 50 mM (ABC) to reduce the final TFE concentration to 10% (v/v). The sample was digested for 1 h at 37 C by adding LysC at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:100, followed by a digestion at 37 C overnight after adding trypsin at a ratio of 1:100. Digests were then diluted 1:4 with formic acid 0.1% (v/v) and purified with Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges according to manufacturerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s instructions. Peptide concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

### Data Protocol
All data was analyzed with the MaxQuant proteomics data analysis workflow version 1.4.0.6 with the Andromeda search engine. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) was set to 1% for protein, peptide spectrum match and site decoy fraction level. Peptides were required to have a minimum length of 7 amino acids and a maximum mass of 4,600 Da. MaxQuant was used to score fragmentation scans for identification based on a search with an allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion of up to 4.5 ppm after time dependent mass calibration. The allowed fragment mass deviation was 20 ppm. Fragmentation spectra were searched by Andromeda in the International Protein Index human database (version 3.68; 87,061 entries) combined with 262 common contaminants. Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to Arginine and Lysine, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and N-terminal protein Acetylation and Oxidation (M) as variable modifications for the HeLa total cell lysates; additionally Phospho (STY) was set as variable modification for the phosphorylation-enriched samples. Further downstream analysis of the results was performed with in-house developed tooling for extraction of meta-data from the mass spectrometry files based on MSFileReader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and with the R scripting and statistical environment  using ggplot for data visualization.
