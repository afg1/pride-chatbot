### Title
Role of the Ste20-like kinase SLK in Podocyte Adhesion

### Description
SLK controls the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and migration. Analysis of a protein kinase phosphorylation site dataset showed that podocyte adhesion proteins â€“ paxillin, vinculin and talin-1 may be potential SLK substrates. The project examines if these adhesion proteins are substrates of SLK.

### Sample Protocol
For mass spectrometry, we transfected COS1 cells (African green monkey kidney) with SLK cDNA. Lysates of COS1 cells or GECs were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates underwent in-gel trypsin digestion; only the top portion of the gel was used for talin analysis in COS1 cells. This was followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion LC-MS/MC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified using the Mascot 2.5.1 search engine (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) and spectral counts were analyzed with Scaffold_5 software (Proteome Software, Portland, OR).

### Publication Abstract
SLK controls the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and migration. Podocyte-specific deletion of SLK in mice leads to podocyte injury as mice age and exacerbates injury in experimental focal segment glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; adriamycin nephrosis). We hypothesized that adhesion proteins may be substrates of SLK. In adriamycin nephrosis, podocyte ultrastructural injury was exaggerated by SLK deletion. Analysis of a protein kinase phosphorylation site dataset showed that podocyte adhesion proteins-paxillin, vinculin, and talin-1 may be potential SLK substrates. In cultured podocytes, deletion of SLK increased adhesion to collagen. Analysis of paxillin, vinculin, and talin-1 showed that SLK deletion reduced focal adhesion complexes (FACs) containing these proteins mainly in adriamycin-induced injury; there was no change in FAC turnover (focal adhesion kinase Y397 phosphorylation). In podocytes, paxillin S250 showed basal phosphorylation that was slightly enhanced by SLK; however, SLK did not phosphorylate talin-1. In adriamycin nephrosis, SLK deletion did not alter glomerular expression/localization of talin-1 and vinculin, but increased focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation modestly. Therefore, SLK decreases podocyte adhesion, but FAC proteins in podocytes are not major substrates of SLK in health and disease.
