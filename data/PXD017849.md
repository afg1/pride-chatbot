### Title
High Fructose-Driven Epigenetic and Metabolic Reprogramming in Glomerular Podocyte

### Description
High fructose diet has been proposed as a major contributor to metabolic syndrome, which is usually accompanied with proteinuria due to glomerular podocyte injury. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms of fructose-induced podocyte injury remain elusive. In this study, we have used an iTRAQ based quantitative proteomic strategy to comprehensively characterize the dynamic proteome changes in glomeruli of high fructose-fed rats, and revealed global fructose-induced glomerular metabolic reprogramming at four different stages during the progression of high fructose modeling.

### Sample Protocol
100mg rat glomerulus sample was used for protein extraction as previously described. Briefly, the rat glomeruli were first homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III and V, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, pH 7.4), incubated for 30 min on ice, then followed by non-contact ultrasonic decomposition at 4 °C using Bioruptor Plus sonication device (Diagenode, Belgium). The supernatant was collected and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The protein concentration was determined with the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) and further confirmed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. For on-filter protein digestion, an aliquot of total protein (100 μg) was diluted to 100 μL with 0.5 M TEAB, reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 1 h at 55 °C, and then alkylated with 6.25 mM MMTS for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. The obtained protein was then transferred to 10K filter (Vivacon, USA) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to remove solvent and washed 3 times with 100 μL 0.5 M TEAB by repeating centrifugation. Finally, trypsin (Promega, USA) was added onto the filter at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight, and 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion at 37 °C. The resultant peptides were collected and labeled with iTRAQ Reagent-8 plex Multiplex Kit (SCIEX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were labeled as shown in Supplementary Table 1: In one individual iTRAQ experiment, four glomerulus samples from normal rats (N4, N8, N12 and N16) were labeled with iTRAQ tag 113, 115, 117 or 119, and four glomerulus samples from fructose modeling rats (M4, M8, M12 and M16) were labeled with iTRAQ tag 114, 116, 118 or 121. Two independent biological replicates were set. For each iTRAQ experiment, all labeled peptides were pooled, speedvac dried and fractionated into 48 fractions using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (SHIMADZU) with a Durashell C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm). Finally, 16 samples were obtained by pooling every 16 fractions, e.g. pool fraction 1, 17, 33 as sample 1, fraction 2, 18, 34, as sample 2, until fraction 16, 32, 48 as sample 16. After desalting and speedvac drying, 16 samples were resuspended in 3% (v/v), formic acid 2% (v/v) acetonitrile for LC-MS/MS analysis. MS data acquisition was performed with a NanoLC.2D (Eksigent Technologies) coupled with a TripleTOF 5600+ System (SCIEX). Samples were chromatographed using a 120 min gradient from 2–80% (mobile phase A 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 2% (v/v) acetonitrile; mobile phase B 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 98% (v/v) acetonitrile) after direct injection onto a nanoLC Column, 3C18-CL, 75 μm*15 cm (Eksigent Technologies). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 2% to 30% solvent B over 85 min, 30% to 50% B in 20 min and climbing to 80% B in 1 min then holding at 80% B for the last 4 min, all at a constant flow-rate of 300 nL/min. MS spectra were collected in the range 350–1,500 m/z for 250 ms. The 50 most intense precursors with charge state 2–5 were selected for fragmentation, and MS/MS spectra were collected in the range 100–2,000 m/z for 100 ms; precursor ions were excluded from reselection for 15 s.

### Data Protocol
The original MS/MS data were submitted to ProteinPilot Software (version 4.5, AB Sciex) for data analysis and searched against Rattus norvegicus in UniProt database. The following search parameters were used: the instrument was TripleTOF 5600, iTRAQ quantification, trypsin digestion, cysteine modified with MMTS; thorough ID, quantitate, bias correction and background correction were checked for protein quantification and normalization. An automatic decoy database search strategy was used to estimate FDR (false discovery rate) using the PSPEP (Proteomics System Performance Evaluation Pipeline Software) algorithm.

### Publication Abstract
High fructose consumption is a significant risking factor for glomerular podocyte injury. However, the causes of high fructose-induced glomerular podocyte injury are still unclear. In this study, we reported a novel mechanism by which high fructose induced ferroptosis, a newly form of programmed cell death, in glomerular podocyte injury. We performed quantitative proteomic analysis in glomeruli of high fructose-fed rats to identify key regulating proteins involved in glomerular injury, and found that mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1) was markedly upregulated. Depletion of SSBP1 could alleviate high fructose-induced ferroptotic cell death in podocytes. Subsequently, we found that SSBP1 positively regulated a transcription factor p53 by interacting with DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and p53 to drive ferroptosis in high fructose-induced podocyte injury. Mechanically, SSBP1 activated DNA-PK to induce p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 (S15) to promote the nuclear accumulation of p53, and thereby inhibited expression of ferroptosis regulator solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in high fructose-exposed podocytes. Natural antioxidant pterostilbene was showed to downregulate SSBP1 and then inhibit DNA-PK/p53 pathway in its alleviation of high fructose-induced glomerular podocyte ferroptosis and injury. This study identified SSBP1 as a novel intervention target against high fructose-induced podocyte ferroptosis and suggested that the suppression of SSBP1 by pterostilbene may be a potential therapy for the treatment of podocyte ferroptosis in glomerular injury.
