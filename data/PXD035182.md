### Title
SAMHD1 controls innate immunity by regulating condensation of immunogenic self RNA

### Description
Recognition of pathogen-derived foreign nucleic acids is central to innate immune defense. This requires discrimination between structurally highly similar self and nonself nucleic acids to avoid aberrant inflammatory responses as in the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutires syndrome (AGS). How vast amounts of self RNA are shielded from immune recognition to prevent autoinflammation is not fully understood. Here we show that SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), one of the AGS-causing genes, functions as a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 3«exonuclease, the lack of which causes cellular RNA accumulation. Increased ssRNA in cells leads to dissolution of RNA-protein condensates, which sequester immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Release of sequestered dsRNA from condensates triggers activation of antiviral type I interferon via retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. Our results establish SAMHD1 as a key regulator of cellular RNA homeostasis and demonstrate that buffering of immunogenic self RNA by condensates regulates innate immune responses.

### Sample Protocol
For in-solution digestion with trypsin and rLys-C protein, samples were diluted to 1 pmol/µl in 20 mM NH4HCO3. An aliquot of 50 µl from each sample was digested subsequently with trypsin (200 ng / 24 h) and rLys-C (100 ng / 24 h). Finally, 5 µl of the digested solution were acidified using 3 µl of 30% formic acid in water, supplemented with 25 fmol/µl standard peptide mixture (PierceT Peptide Retention Time Calibration Mixture, ThermoFisher, 88321) and diluted to a final volume of 23 µl with water. Five microliter of this solution were injected for nano LC-MS/MS. Nano LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q ExactiveT HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) hyphenated to a nanoflow LC system (Thermo ScientificT Dionex UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC (RSLC) system). Peptides were separated in a linear gradient of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid in 60% acetonitrile (eluent B) over 45min, and the mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA, TopN 10).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were converted to peak list files (mgf) with MSConverter (Kessner et al., 2008). Peptide and protein identification was performed with Mascot V2.6 (Matrixscience). In addition, peptide hits were evaluated and aggregated in Scaffold 4.11 (ProteomeSoftware) (Searle, 2010).

### Publication Abstract
Recognition of pathogen-derived foreign nucleic acids is central to innate immune defense. This requires discrimination between structurally highly similar self and nonself nucleic acids to avoid aberrant inflammatory responses as in the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Gouti&#xe8;res syndrome (AGS). How vast amounts of self RNA are shielded from immune recognition to prevent autoinflammation is not fully understood. Here, we show that human SAM-domain- and HD-domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), one of the AGS-causing genes, functions as a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 3'exonuclease, the lack of which causes cellular RNA accumulation. Increased ssRNA in cells leads to dissolution of RNA-protein condensates, which sequester immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Release of sequestered dsRNA from condensates triggers activation of antiviral type I interferon via retinoic-acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. Our results establish SAMHD1 as a key regulator of cellular RNA homeostasis and demonstrate that buffering of immunogenic self RNA by condensates regulates innate immune responses.
