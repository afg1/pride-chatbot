### Title
Proteome analysis reveals alterations in protein profile upon ectomycorrhiza establishment in oak roots

### Description
Trees establish a symbiotic relationship with specialized soil fungi, called ectomycorrhizae, which is essential for nutrition, growth and health of temperate forest ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms governing the establishment and functioning of ectomycorrhiza is important because of the role of forests in sequestering CO2 and also to develop ways to optimize tree productivity and sustainability. Here, we investigated the response of an oak species to ectomycorrhiza formation using a two dimensional differential in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry proteomics approach.  At the root level, changes in the abundance of 34 unique oak proteins were detected and revealed proteins involved in carbon and energy metabolism, protein processing and degradation, response to oxidative stress, lipid metabolism/transport, nitrogen and phosphorous assimilation and cell wall modification. Proteins supporting the importance of the secretory pathway functioning, in particular of the endoplasmic reticulum, during ectomycorrhiza functioning were identified. These proteins were identified as components of the endoplasmic reticulum folding/chaperoning machinery and proteins involved in the ER quality control system. This study constitutes an important contribution for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the response of plants to ectomycorrhizal symbiosis establishment.

### Sample Protocol
Pisolithus tinctorius was grown on BAF agar medium and subsequently in a peat-vermiculite mixture moistened with liquid BAF medium as described previously (Sebastiana et al. 2013a). Cork oak seeds were germinated in a greenhouse, in plastic trays containing soil acquired from a gardening store. After germination, three months old plantlets were transferred and inoculated with P. tinctorius peat-vermiculite inoculum (3 months old), according to Sebastiana et al. (2013a). For the control treatment, cork oak plantlets were treated with a non-inoculated peat-vermiculite mixture. Plants were grown in pots in a greenhouse and watered once a week with 500 ml of tap water. No fertilization was applied. Two months after inoculation, secondary roots presenting ECM tips and equivalent roots from control plants were sampled; leaves from mycorrhizal and control plants were also collected.  Protein extraction was performed according to the phenol protocol, as described previously (Sebastiana et al. 2013b). Protein quantity was measured with the 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare). Protein extracts were concentrated using the 2-D Clean-Up kit (GE Healthcare). The experiment included four different treatments (mycorhizal and non-symbiotic, each composed of roots and leaves), and for each treatment 5 biological replicate samples were generated, each comprising 5-6 different plants. The replicates were labelled using CyDye DIGE Fluor minimal dyes (GE Healthcare), according to manufactures’ instructions. The proteins were separated by 2D-DIGE and gel images analysed by Progenesis SameSpot V4.5 (Nonlinear Dynamics). The detection and filtering of interest spots was made and the images were separated into four groups, mycorrhizal roots/leaves and non-symbiotic roots/leaves. Raw intensities of spots of the ECM root samples were corrected to account for the 0.91: 0.09 plant-fungus relative biomass in the ECM tissues analysed (determined by the ergosterol assay). By this procedure we normalized the Cy dye intensity values to account for the different root protein quantity present in mycorrhizal tissue (91% root protein and 9% P. tinctorius protein) and non-symbiotic tissue (100% root protein). Variation of protein acumulation between ECM and non-symbiotic treatments was considered statistically significant if the absolute abundance variation was at least 1.0-fold between spots of any experimental group with a p-value ≤ 0.05 by ANOVA and a power value ≥ 0.7. Differentially abundant spots were excised from Comassie 2D-gels loaded with 400 µg of protein for identification. The tryptic peptides concentrated with POROS R2 microcolumns (GELoader tip, Eppendorf) and co-crystallised in MALDI-TOF/TOF sample plates using the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). Peptide mass spectra were acquired using a MALDI-TOF/TOF 4800 plus MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Tandem mass spectral data were submitted to database searching using Mascot (Matrix Science, version 2.2.07) and ProteinPilot (Applied Biosystems, version 3.0, rev. 114732).

### Data Protocol
Progenesis SameSpot V4.5  Mascot (Matrix Science, version 2.2.07) and ProteinPilot (Applied Biosystems, version 3.0, rev. 114732) Gene ontology (GO) annotation was obtained using the QuickGO annotation tool with the Plant GO slim.  Interpro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) was used for classification of proteins into families and prediction of domains and important sites.

### Publication Abstract
An increased knowledge on the real impacts of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in forest species is needed to optimize forest sustainable productivity and thus to improve forest services and their capacity to act as carbon sinks. In this study, we investigated the response of an oak species to ectomycorrhizae formation using a proteomics approach complemented by biochemical analysis of carbohydrate levels. Comparative proteome analysis between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal cork oak plants revealed no differences at the foliar level. However, the protein profile of 34 unique oak proteins was altered in the roots. Consistent with the results of the biochemical analysis, the proteome analysis of the mycorrhizal roots suggests a decreasing utilization of sucrose for the metabolic activity of mycorrhizal roots which is consistent with an increased allocation of carbohydrates from the plant to the fungus in order to sustain the symbiosis. In addition, a promotion of protein unfolding mechanisms, attenuation of defense reactions, increased nutrient mobilization from the plant-fungus interface (N and P), as well as cytoskeleton rearrangements and induction of plant cell wall loosening for fungal root accommodation in colonized roots are also suggested by the results. The suggested improvement in root capacity to take up nutrients accompanied by an increase of root biomass without apparent changes in aboveground biomass strongly re-enforces the potential of mycorrhizal inoculation to improve cork oak forest resistance capacity to cope with coming climate change.
