### Title
Proteomics analysis of HepG2 after administration of dehydroabietic acid

### Description
Proteomics identification of the HepG2 test group after administration of dehydroabietic acid was implemented to disclose the influencing mechanism of dehydroabietic acid on HepG2.

### Sample Protocol
Take the cells in the logarithmic growth phase, collect them into a 15ml centrifuge tube, centrifuge at 1000g for 5-10 min at 4°C, and remove the supernatant; Wash 3 times with 10ml PBS; finally resuspend cells in 1ml PBS and transfer to a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube; Centrifuge again to remove as much supernatant as possible; Quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for a short period of time and sent on dry ice, Protein extraction, Enzymatic digestion of proteins, Library construction of data dependence acquisition(DDA), DIA analysis, Peptide data statistics, Differential protein expression

### Data Protocol
DDA original data collected in mass spectrometry was input into Spectronout Pulsar X (Biognosys  Company) for library searching analysis. The human protein dataset downloaded from uniprot was used. Parameters for building the library used the default optimal parameters “GBS factory setting”, including: tolerance of MS1=10 ppm, tolerance of level-2 pieces=0.02 Da, and the maximum allowable missing number=2. Cysteine Carbamidomethyl was fixed modification, while oxidization of methionine and N-terminal acetylation of protein were variable modification. The false positive rate of peptides and protein level was FDR<0.01 and the independent peptide was at least larger than 1. Next, the DIA original data was input into Spectronout Pulsar X for qualitative and quantitative protein analysis.
