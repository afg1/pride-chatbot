### Title
Quantitative Proteomics Analysis to Assess Protein Expression Levels in the Ovaries of Pubescent Goats

### Description
Herein we identified 301 (176 up- and 125 downregulated) differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the ovaries of pubertal and prepubertal Anhui white goats (P < 0.05) using quantitative proteomics techniques based on LC–MS/MS and iTRAQ. Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis revealed that several DAPs enriched in biological processes were related to cellular process, biological regulation, metabolic process, and response to stimulus. Further, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis indicated that DAPs were enriched in olfactory translation, glutathione metabolism, and calcium signaling pathways.

### Sample Protocol
Three prepubertal (2.5 months of age, 8.1 ± 0.3 kg) and three pubertal (4.5–5.0 months of age, 20.16 ± 0.35 kg) Anhui white goats (an indigenous Chinese breed) were housed under the same conditions on a farm in Feixi County, Anhui Province, China. The animals were deeply anesthetized by intramuscularly injecting 1% pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, Solarbio, P8410, China). The left ovary was then surgically removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and they were stored at −80°C until needed. Quantitative proteomics techniques based on Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantization (iTRAQ) were used to identify and characterize the protein differences between prepubertal and pubertal ovaries of goats. The process as follow: protein extraction, enzymolysis, iTRAQ labeling, sample mixing, and LC-MS/MS analysis.  In MS, balance group can show the same m/z no matter which report ion label peptide. In MS2, the intensity of report ions reflects the relative abundance of the peptide in different samples while other peaks from peptide fragmentations are used for identification. After the raw data is obtained, each bioinformatics analysis will be performed.

### Data Protocol
Hierarchical Cluster (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) and Java TreeView (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net) were used for hierarchical clustering analysis. All genes corresponding to DAPs were subjected to GO annotation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology) and KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) analyses. Gene symbols of DAPs were submitted to the STRING database (http://string-db.org/), and Cytoscape v3.2.1 (http://www.cytoscape.org/) was used to generate and analyze PPI networks.
