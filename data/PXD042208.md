### Title
Effect of Flavivirus infections on host cell gene and protein expression

### Description
As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely heavily on their host cells for their replication, and therefore dysregulate several cellular processes for their benefit. In return, host cells activate multiple signaling pathways to limit viral replication and eradicate viruses. The present study explores the complex interplay between viruses and their host cells through next generation RNA sequencing as well as mass spectrometry (SILAC).

### Sample Protocol
Cells were grown in SILAC media and either virus-infected (Zika, Yellow Fever, Sindbis) or treated with cell-conditioned media. Proteins were digested by trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Isotope labeling: mock - light (R0K0), Zika and Yellow Fever - medium (R6K4), Sindbis - heavy (R10K8)

### Data Protocol
Peptide identification and quantification was performed using the MaxQuant software package version 1.6.14 with the human protein database from Uniprot. Differential protein expression analysis was performed with Proteus R package 0.2.15.

### Publication Abstract
As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely heavily on host cells for replication, and therefore dysregulate several cellular processes for their benefit. In return, host cells activate multiple signaling pathways to limit viral replication and eradicate viruses. The present study explores the complex interplay between viruses and host cells through next generation RNA sequencing as well as mass spectrometry (SILAC). Both the coding transcriptome and the proteome of human brain-derived U87 cells infected with Kunjin virus, Zika virus, or Yellow Fever virus were compared to the transcriptome and the proteome of mock-infected cells. Changes in the abundance of several hundred mRNAs and proteins were found in each infection. Moreover, the alternative splicing of hundreds of mRNAs was found to be modulated upon viral infection. Interestingly, a significant disconnect between the changes in the transcriptome and those in the proteome of infected cells was observed. These findings provide a global view of the coding transcriptome and the proteome of Flavivirus-infected cells, leading to a better comprehension of Flavivirus-host interactions.
