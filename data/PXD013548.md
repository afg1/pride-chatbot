### Title
Rickettsia-HUVECs secretome and Rickettsia-mouse plasma proteome

### Description
Proteomics profiling of the secretome of HUVEC cells infected with Rickettsia; Proteomics pprofiling of the plasma proteome of mice infected with Rickettsia.

### Sample Protocol
For the secretome study, the cell culture media were collected and the proteins in the media were digested with trypin and quantified with label-free proteomics. For the plasma proteome, the plasma from the mice infected were collected, the proteins in the plasma were digested with trypin and quantified with label-free proteomics.

### Data Protocol
The MS raw data were analyzed with Maxquant and then Perseus.
