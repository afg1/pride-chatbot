### Title
Inhibition of melanization activation by Serpin-5 and Serpin-9 promotes nucleopolyhedrovirus infection in cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera

### Description
One of important insect defense mechanisms is melanization, which are mediated by clip domain serine protease (cSP) cascades and regulated by Serpins. In vitro, activation of melanization can efficiently kill Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). However, quantitative proteomics revealed that the infection of NPV in cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera suppressed protein levels of melanization components in the host hemolymph. It also reduced the prophenoloxidase (PPO) activity. In contrast, Serpin-9 and -5 were sequentially up-regulated. Serpin-5 and -9 induced by NPV infection play important roles in regulate host melanization by directly inhibiting their target proteases cSP4 and cSP6 respectively. Furthermore, Serpin-5 or -9 depleted insects exhibited high PO activities and show resistance to NPV infection. Together, our results characterized melanization cascade in H. armigera, and suggests that natural insect virus NPV has evolved a distinct strategy to suppress host immune system. This finding may be exploited to design more potent viruses against agricultural pests.

### Sample Protocol
The cell-free hemolymph samples were prepared as previously described (27). After virus ingestion, prolegs of larvae were cut and hemolymph was collected into clean tubes containing 1mM phenylthiourea (PTU) and 1mM p-aminobenzamidine (pAB) at 48 and 72 hpi respectively. The hemolymph was then centrifuged at 4000 g at 4 ��C for 5 min to remove hemocytes. Hemolymph from six infected larvae at 48 hpi was pooled as 48 h infected hemolymph-1 (48hI1) and from six infected larvae at 72 hpi was used as 72 h infected hemolymph-1 (72hI1). Similarly, 48 h mock-infected hemolymph-1 (48hM1) and 72 h mock-infected hemolymph-1 (72hM1) were prepared from six mock-infected larvae at 48 and 72 hpi respectively. The experiment was repeat twice again. Then the protein concentrations of hemolymph samples were determined using the BCA methods. Equal amount of tested samples (25 ��g) were separated on 4-15% gradients SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 for visualization. Subsequently, the gel lanes were excised into 12 slices or 6 slices for 48h samples and 5 slices for 72h samples. Gels slices were subjected to reduction, alkylation and in-gel digestion with mass spectrometry grade trypsin (Promega). After digestion, the resulting peptides were extracted by 60% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoacetic acid in water, almost dried in a speedvac, solubilized in 2% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoacetic acid in water, ultracentrifuged and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis as describe previously (Xing et al, submitted).All MS experiments were performed on a Q Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) connected to an EASY-nLC 1, 000 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific). In short, peptide mixtures were separated by reverse phase chromatography using in-house made C18 microcolumns in 120 min LC gradient from 5% to 80% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min and directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometry. One full MS scan (resolution 70 000, mass range 350-2000 m/z) was followed by MS/MS scans with detection of fragment ions in the HCD mode (resolution 17 500). The precursor ions were isolated and fragmented by higher collisional-induced dissociation. Charge state screening was enabled, rejecting unassigned or singly charged ions. Three replicates were performed for each biological sample in the LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The MS data analysis was performed with the Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.4.0.288; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supported by a protein database (denoted here as HarmigeraNPV_001). The database was deduced form the putative ORFs based on the transcriptomes unignene dataset15 and HearNPV DNA genome (23). Protein identification and quantification were performed as describe (Xing et al, submitted). The relative abundance of proteins within a single technical replicate was represented as the peak area of the target protein which was normalized against the average peak area of two house-keeping proteins (angiotensin converting enzyme and laminin ��-2 chain). The relative expression abundance were analyzed by Student��s t-test. A protein with a fold change �� 1.4 and p < 0.05 was considered to be differentially regulated.

### Publication Abstract
Melanization, an important insect defense mechanism, is mediated by clip-domain serine protease (cSP) cascades and is regulated by serpins. Here we show that proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase (PPO) and PO-catalyzed melanization kill the baculovirus in vitro. Our quantitative proteomics and biochemical experiments revealed that baculovirus infection of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, reduced levels of most cascade members in the host hemolymph and PO activity. By contrast, serpin-9 and serpin-5 were sequentially upregulated after the viral infection. The H. armigera serpin-5 and serpin-9 regulate melanization by directly inhibiting their target proteases cSP4 and cSP6, respectively and cSP6 activates PPO purified from hemolymph. Furthermore, serpin-5/9-depleted insects exhibited high PO activities and showed resistance to baculovirus infection. Together, our results characterize a part of the melanization cascade in H. armigera, and suggest that natural insect virus baculovirus has evolved a distinct strategy to suppress the host immune system.
