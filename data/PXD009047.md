### Description
The use of Nitric Oxide as a Radiosensitiser of Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Characterized by Data Independent Label-free Ion Mobility LC-MS

### Sample Protocol
Radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are curative treatment methods for localised prostate cancer whilst the cancer is hormone sensitive. Radiotherapy as treatment of localised prostate cancer is common but it is also used in combination with hormonal manipulation for locally advanced cancer. Hypoxia occurs in most solid tumours, including prostate cancer, and it has been shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of poor clinical outcome. The reason for this hypoxia response is because at low O2 levels tumour cells adapt to the hypoxic environment and attain survival characteristics. Hypoxia is known to cause resistance to radiotherapy. NO-NSAID compounds, such as NO-sulindac. can abrogate the hypoxia response and hence radiosensitise prostate cancer cells in vitro.

### Data Protocol
Hypoxic cells (0.2% O2) from prostate carcinoma cell line (PC-3) before and after irradiation (4Gy) in the presence or absence of NO-sulindac were extracted using a sucrose gradient and a PBS buffer system. The experimental design comprised 6 treatment methods, 3 biological replicates per treatment and presence/absence of NO and 3 technical replicates per sample. The proteins were in-solution digested and characterized by data independent label-free ion mobility LC-MS. The data were randomly acquired and quantified with a data independent analysis method that utilizes a nanoscale LC system directly interfaced to a hybrid IMS-oaToF mass spectrometer. One-dimensional nanoscale LC separation of tryptic peptides was performed with an ACQUITY M Class system (Waters Corporation), equipped with a Symmetry C18 5 µm, 2 cm x 180 µm precolumn and an HSS T3 C18 1.7 µm, 15 cm x 75 µm analytical RP column (Waters Corporation). Samples were transferred with aqueous 0.1% (v/v) formic acid to the precolumn at a flow rate of 15 µl/min for 2 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a Synapt G2 mass spectrometer. For all measurements, the mass spectrometer was operated in v-mode with nominal resolution of 25,000 FWHM. Accurate mass LC-MS data were collected in mobility assisted data independent ((U)(H)DMSE) mode of acquisition. ProteinLynx GlobalSERVER version 3.0.2 was used to process all data acquired. Protein identifications were obtained by the reviewed entries of a Homo Sapiens UniProt database (20,161 reviewed entries, release 2016_10). ISOQuant was applied for the co-detection based quantitative analysis of data derived from multiple LC-MS runs.

### Publication Abstract
Prostate cancer accounts for around 15% of male deaths in Western Europe and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men after lung cancer. Mounting evidence suggests that prostate cancer deposits exist within a hypoxic environment and this contributes to radio-resistance thus hampering one of the major therapies for this cancer. Recent reports have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced tumour hypoxia as well as maintaining a radio-sensitising/therapeutic effect on prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on the proteome of the prostate and to establish whether NO-NSAID treatment reverted the protein profiles back to their normoxic status. To this end an established hormone insensitive prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions before and following exposure to NO-NSAID in combination with selected other common prostate cancer treatment types. The extracted proteins were analysed by ion mobility-assisted data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (MS), combined with multivariate statistical analyses, to measure hypoxia-induced alterations in the proteome of these cells. The analyses demonstrated that under hypoxic conditions there were well-defined, significantly regulated/differentially expressed proteins primarily involved with structural and binding processes including, for example, TUBB4A, CIRP and PLOD1. Additionally, the exposure of hypoxic cells to NSAID and NO-NSAID agents, resulted in some of these proteins being differentially expressed; for example, both PCNA and HNRNPA1L were down-regulated, corresponding with disruption in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling process.
