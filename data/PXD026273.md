### Title
A SISCAPA-based approach for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens from clinical samples.

### Description
SARS-CoV-2 has created a global disease burden infecting >100 million humans in just over a year. In this study, we adopted a SISCAPA-based enrichment approach using anti-peptide antibodies generated against peptides from the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. We developed a targeted workflow in which nasopharyngeal samples were digested followed by enrichment of viral peptides using the anti-peptide antibodies and targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis using a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This workflow was applied to 41 RT-PCR-confirmed clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples and 30 negative samples. The SISCAPA-based platform described in the current study can serve as one of the alternative methods for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection.

### Sample Protocol
Nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID positive and COVID-19 negative patients were collected.  750 µl of each nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in a 96-well plate. Viral inactivation and reduction of proteins was done by addition of 15 µl of 1 M dithiothreitol and 15 µl of 0.1% ZWITTERGENT 3-16 Detergent and incubating at 70 ℃ for 30 minutes. Alkylation was done using 45 µl of 1 M iodoacetamide, vortexed and incubated in dark for 30 minutes. Finally, 250 µl of 1 M Tris hydrochloride solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), pH 8.0 buffer was added and digested using 2.5 µg of Worthington TPCK treated trypsin. The digested peptides were then subjected to SISCAPA immunoprecipitation using anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies against three peptides- ITFGGPSDSTGSNNQNGER, DGIIWVATEGALNTPK and NPANNAAIVLQLPQGTTLPK by using automatic liquid handler. The eluate was then dried, reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and subjected to targeted analysis using parallel reaction monitoring.

### Data Protocol
The data analysis was performed by using Skyline. The peaks were manually verified for correct detection of the peak, exact integration and lacking the interferences. Peaks were inspected for correct retention time and observed for precise peak area ratios across the samples and correlated with the light peptide standard.  The total peak area was calculated by considering summing of all the selected transitions. The coefficient of variation was calculated by dividing standard deviation with mean and expressed as a percentage.
