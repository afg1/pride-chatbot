### Title
Axonal and somatodendritic proteomes of dopamine neurons in the mouse brain

### Description
Dopamine (DA) neurons modulate neural circuits and behaviors via dopamine release from expansive, long range axonal projections. The elaborate cytoarchitecture of DA neurons is embedded within complex brain tissues, making it difficult to access the DA neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell type-specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of DA neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying axonal transport, dopamine transmission, and axonal metabolism in DA neurons. We find a significant enrichment of proteins encoded by Parkinson’s disease-linked genes in dopaminergic axons, including proteins with previously undescribed axonal localization. Our proteomic datasets comprise a significant resource for axonal and DA neuronal cell biology, while the methodology developed here will enable future studies of other neural cell types.

### Sample Protocol
Capture and processing of biotinylated proteins was conducted as previously described (Kalocsay, 2019; Liu et al., 2020) with only minor modifications. Immediately after dissection in ice-cold quenching aCSF, tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further use. Frozen tissues were homogenized on ice in a glass dounce homogenizer (Sigma D9063) with 30 strokes of both A and B pestles. Lysis was in 0.75 mL of ice-cold tissue lysis buffer, consisting of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM Trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide, and 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). After addition of 39 µL of 10% SDS (final concentration 0.5%), lysates were rotated for 15 minutes at 4°C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,130 xg for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to a new pre-chilled Eppendorf tube for trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation.  Proteins were precipitated from lysates by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 55% TCA. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 21,130 xg for 10 minutes at 4°C. Protein pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of acetone pre-chilled to -20°C and re-centrifuged as before. Pellets were resuspended and re-centrifuged another three times in 1 mL of acetone pre-chilled to -20°C, for a total of four washes. Residual acetone was removed, and protein pellets were resuspended in Urea Dissolve Buffer (8M Urea, 1% SDS, 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8, 100 mM NH4HCO3). Dissolution of pellets was facilitated by water both sonication for 10 minutes followed by gentle agitation on an orbital shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Removal of residual TCA was confirmed by checking that the pH ~8.0. In some cases, a small aliquot (5%) of the resuspended protein was flash-frozen and stored at -80°C. 1/49 the volume of 500 mM TCEP (Sigma, cat. #646547) and 1/19 the volume of freshly prepared 400 mM iodoacetamide (ThermoFisher, cat. #90034) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 was added to the protein resuspension for disulfide reduction and cysteine alkylation at final concentrations of 10 mM TCEP and 20 mM iodoacetamide. The suspension was vortexed and incubated in the dark for 25 minutes at room temperature. Alkylation was quenched by addition of 1/19 the volume of 1 M DTT to reach 50 mM DTT. Samples were diluted with 0.87x volumes of H2O to reach a final concentration of 4 M Urea and 0.5% SDS.  Streptavidin magnetic beads (ThermoFisher #88817) were resuspended and washed three times in Urea Detergent Wash Buffer (4 M Urea, 0.5% SDS, 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8) for at least 10 minutes at 4°C. After washing, streptavidin beads were resuspended in ice-cold Urea Detergent Wash Buffer and 50 µL containing 0.5 mg of beads was added to each sample. Proteins were incubated with streptavidin beads overnight on a rotor at 4°C. After 14-18 hours, the unbound supernatant was discarded, and beads were resuspended in 1 mL of Urea Detergent Wash Buffer and transferred to a new tube. Beads were washed three times for 5-10 minutes in 1 mL of Urea Detergent Wash Buffer at room temperature. After the third wash, beads were resuspended in 1 mL of Urea Wash Buffer (4 M Urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8) and transferred to a new tube. After three 5-10-minute washes in 1 mL of Urea Wash Buffer at room temperature, beads were resuspended in 200 µL of Urea Wash Buffer and transferred to a new tube. A 10 µL aliquot (5%) was transferred to a separate tube and the remaining 190 µL of buffer were removed on a magnetic stand. Beads were flash frozen and stored at -80°C.  Proteins bounded streptavidin beads were resuspended in 200 µl of digestion buffer (1M urea, 100mM EPPS pH 8.5 , 4% acetonitrile) and digested with 2 µg of trypsin/LysC mix overnight at 37°C. The next day, digested peptides were collected in a new microfuge tube and digestion was stopped by the addition of 1% TFA (final v/v), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 xg for 10 min at room temperature. Cleared digested peptides were desalted on a SDB-RP Stage-Tip and dried in a speed-vac. Dried peptides were dissolved in 3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Desalted peptides (300-500 ng) were injected onto an EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18 50 cm x 75 μm column (Thermo Scientific), which was coupled to the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted with a non-linear 120 min gradient of 5-30% buffer B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The column temperature was maintained at a constant 50 ˚C during all experiments.

### Data Protocol
DIA data were analyzed with directDIA 2.0, a spectral library-free analysis pipeline featured in Spectronaut Pulsar X software (Biognosys AG). The default settings were used for targeted analysis of DIA data in Spectronaut except the decoy generation was set to “mutated”. False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using the mProphet approach (Reiter et al., 2011) and set to 1% at peptide precursor level and at 1% at protein level.
