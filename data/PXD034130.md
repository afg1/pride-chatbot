### Title
An N-glycan on the C2 domain of Jagged-1 is essential for Notch activation

### Description
Glycoproteomic determination of human Jagged-1 glycan composition

### Sample Protocol
Approximately 5µg sample was reduced, loaded and run on an SDS-PAGE and gel bands were excised. Gel pieces were washed sequentially with HPLC grade water followed by 1:1 (v/v) MeCN/H2O. Protein gel bands were dried (via vacuum centrifuge), treated with 10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100nM NH4HCO3 and incubated for 45 minutes at 56°C with shaking. The DTT was removed and 55mM iodoacetamide (in 100nM NH4HCO3) was added and incubated for 30 minutes in the dark. All liquid was removed and gels were washed with 100nM NH4HCO3/MeCN as above. Gels were dried and 12.5 ng/µl trypsin, chymotrypsin or alpha lytic protease was added and incubated overnight at 37°C. Gels were then washed, and (glyco)peptides were extracted and pooled with sequential washes with 5% (v/v) formic acid (FA) in H2O and MeCN. Dried samples were reconstituted in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and run by LC-MS. Samples were analysed using an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tryptic peptides were loaded onto a 75 µm × 2 cm pre-column and separated on a 75 µm × 15 cm Pepmap C18 analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Buffer A was 0.1% FA in H2O and buffer B was 0.1% FA in 80% MeCN with 20% H2O. A 40min linear gradient (0% to 40% buffer B) was used. Data was collected in data-dependent acquisition mode with a mass range 330 to 2000 m/z and at a resolution of 120000. For MS/MS scans, HCD normalized energy was set to 30%.

### Data Protocol
Glycopeptide data was analysed with Byonic and imported into Byologic for quantification (Protein Metrics). A minimum Byonic score of 100 was required for each glycopeptide identification. Remaining glycopeptide assignments were manually validated. The extracted ion chromatogram intensities for each glycoform and unoccupied peptides were summed and made relative to the total intensity for each site.

### Publication Abstract
The canonical members of the Jagged/Serrate and Delta families of transmembrane ligands have an extracellular, amino-terminal C2 domain that binds to phospholipids and is required for optimal activation of the Notch receptor. Somatic mutations that cause amino substitutions in the C2 domain in human JAGGED1 (JAG1) have been identified in tumors. We found in reporter cell assays that mutations affecting an N-glycosylation site reduced the ligand's ability to activate Notch. This N-glycosylation site located in the C2 domain is conserved in the Jagged/Serrate family but is lacking in the Delta family. Site-specific glycan analysis of the JAG1 amino terminus demonstrated that occupancy of this site by either a complex-type or high-mannose N-glycan was required for full Notch activation in reporter cell assays. Similarly to JAG1 variants with defects in Notch binding, N-glycan removal, either by mutagenesis of the glycosylation site or by endoglycosidase treatment, reduced receptor activation. The N-glycan variants also reduced receptor activation in a Notch signaling-dependent vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation assay. Loss of the C2 N-glycan reduced JAG1 binding to liposomes to a similar extent as the loss of the entire C2 domain. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the presence of the N-glycan limits the orientation of JAG1 relative to the membrane, thus facilitating Notch binding. These data are consistent with a critical role for the N-glycan in promoting a lipid-binding conformation that is required to orient Jagged at the cell membrane for full Notch activation.
