### Title
Palaeoproteomics species identification of Toteng remains

### Description
This project has two main objectives:  1. Identify the best suited decalcification protocol for bones and teeth from African archaeological sites; 2. Provide species identification of the remains based on UHPLC-MS/MS data.

### Sample Protocol
Archaeological material were sampled with diamond drill and reduced to powder. Three decalcification protocols were tested: one with a Tris-EDTA buffer (0.05 M and 0.5 M, pH 7.4) and the two other with 0.6 and 1 M HCl. Remains were immersed in solutions until decalcification. They were rinsed with MQ water and dried under vacuum. Organic fractions were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and supernatants collected. Extracts were then digested with proteomics grade trypsin overnight. Digests were finally analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS on a Bruker Maxis II ETD mass spectrometer (CID mode, data dependent MSMS acquisition).

### Data Protocol
Data were converted to mgf using Bruker Daltonics software DataAnalysis and generated compounds searched again public protein databases (using Mascot online software, SwissProt and NCBI databases).
