### Title
Mosquito-Derived Anophelin Sulfoproteins are Potent Anti-Thrombotics

### Description
we first expressed AAa and AAg in a eukaryotic system to investigate whether the proteins could be sulfated in vivo. For this purpose we used insect cells as a model of the Anopheles mosquito. Specifically, codon-optimized sequences encoding AAa and AAg were designed as N-terminal fusions with the honeybee mellitin signal sequence in order to direct the recombinant proteins to the secretion pathway and were expressed in Trichoplusia ni insect cells. Following expression, the cell medium containing the secreted proteins was analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS).

### Sample Protocol
Media was filtered through a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off and protein quantified by Qubit florescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The filtrate was aliquoted and either directly loaded onto a C18 solid-phase extraction micro column (3M empore) or digested with trypsin (1:50 trypsin:substrate concentration; 6 h, room temperature) before being loaded onto a C18 micro column. The column was washed with 5% acetonitrile in water and eluted with 60% acetonitrile in water followed by vacuum centrifugation.

### Data Protocol
The purified extract was resuspended in water and analysed on a Dionex 3500RS nanoUHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer in positive mode. The mixture was separated using an in-house packed 75 μm x 40 cm pulled column (1.9 μm particle size, C18AQ; Dr Maisch, Germany) with a gradient of 2 – 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over 150 min at 300 nl/min. An MS1 scan was acquired from 600 – 1800 m/z for intact extracts or 300 – 1500 m/z for digested extracts (60,000 resolution; 5e5 AGC, 100 ms injection time) followed by MS/MS data-dependent acquisition with HCD, ETD or EThcD and detection in the orbitrap (60,000 resolution, 2e5 AGC, 120 ms injection time, calibrated charge-dependent ETD reaction times [2+ 121 ms; 3+ 54 ms; 4+ 30 ms; 5+ 20ms; 6+ 13 ms; 7+; 10 ms], 30 NCE for HCD [or 25 NCE for HCD supplemental activation], 1.8 m/z quadrupole isolation width). All data was processed with Proteome Discoverer (v2.1) using SequestHT and manual analysis / annotation using GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Denmark). The precursor MS and MS/MS tolerance were set to 20 ppm with no enzyme searching. The peptides were searched with the following variable modifications; oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine or glutamine and sulfation of tyrosine.

### Publication Abstract
The anophelins are small protein thrombin inhibitors that are produced in the salivary glands of the <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito to fulfill a vital role in blood feeding. A bioinformatic analysis of anophelin sequences revealed the presence of conserved tyrosine residues in an acidic environment that were predicted to be post-translationally sulfated <i>in vivo</i>. To test this prediction, insect cell expression of two anophelin proteins, from <i>Anopheles albimanus</i> and <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, was performed, followed by analysis by mass spectrometry, which showed heterogeneous sulfation at the predicted sites. Homogeneously sulfated variants of the two proteins were subsequently generated by chemical synthesis via a one-pot ligation-desulfurization strategy. Tyrosine sulfation of the anophelins was shown to significantly enhance the thrombin inhibitory activity, with a doubly sulfated variant of the anophelin from <i>A. albimanus</i> exhibiting a 100-fold increase in potency compared with the unmodified homologue. Sulfated anophelins were also shown to exhibit potent <i>in vivo</i> anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity.
