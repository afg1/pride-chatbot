### Title
Proteomic analysis of protein purified derivative of Mycobacterium bovis

### Description
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) based on in vivo intradermal inoculation of purified protein derivative from M. bovis (bPPD) is the diagnostic test for the control and surveillance of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Proteomic analyses were performed on four bPPD samples from Mycobacterium bovis, strain AN5. Proteins were precipitated from bPPD solutions by TCA precipitation. The proteome of four bPPD preparations was investigated by bottom-up proteomics, which consisted in protein digestion and nano-LC-MS/MS analysis.  Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer coupled online to an Easy nano-LC1000 system. This study represents the highest proteome coverage of bPPD preparations to date. Since proteins perform cellular functions essential to health and/or disease, obtaining knowledge of their presence and variance is of great importance in understanding disease states and for advancing translational studies. Therefore, to better understand Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex biology during infection, survival, and persistence, the reproducible evaluation of the proteins that catalyze and control these processes is critically important. More active and more specific tuberculins would be desirable. The cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacterium species (false-positive results) is crucial to develop better and more defined antigens.

### Sample Protocol
Four bPPD samples from M. bovis, strain AN5, were examined. They were from Spain (S), manufactured by CZV company [CZ Veterinaria S.A., Porriño, (Pontevedra) Spain] and commercialized in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Ireland, Greece, United Kingdom, Belgium, Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Romania; two from Italy (one prepared by Istituto Zooprofilattico dell’Umbria e delle Marche, Perugia (Ip) and one by Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G. Caporale", Teramo (It), respectively) and commercialized in Italy and one from Netherlands (NL), manufactured by Prionics Lelystad BV, Lelystad, Holland and commercialized in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Netherlands. Proteins were precipitated from bPPD solutions by TCA precipitation. Briefly, proteins were precipitated in 10% TCA overnight, then pelleted at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with (i) ethyl ether (ii) acetone. Proteins were resuspended in 100 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) containing 0.2% SDS. Protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay using BSA as standard for the calibration curve (BCA protein assay, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA). For each sample, a 100 μg aliquot was subjected to protein reduction (10 mM DTT, 1 h at 37 °C) and alkylation (24 mM iodoacetamide, 1h at 37 °C). The excess of iodoacetamide was quenched by additional 2 mM DTT. SDS concentration was brought to 0.05% by addition of HPLC water; then, 1 μg of proteomics grade trypsin was added, and digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C.    Samples were labelled by either “light” (L), “medium” (M) or “heavy” (H) dimethyl labelling [21]. An aliquot of each sample, containing 25 μg of protein, was transferred to a separate Eppendorf vial. Then, 4 μL of either 4% (v/v) regular formaldehyde (L) or CD2O (M), or 13CD2O (H) plus 4 μL of either 0.6 M NaBH3CN (L, M) or NaBD3CN (H) were added. Reductive amination was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. To quench the reaction, 16 μL of 1% (v/v) ammonia solution and 8 μL of 5% formic acid were added to the samples. Samples were labelled in duplicates with label swapping, as follows: sample S (L, M, H), sample It (M, L), sample NL (H, L), sample Ip (H, M). Triplets were obtained by combining 5 μg of each labelled sample as follows: 1) S(L):It(M):NL(H); 2) It(L):S(M):Ip(H); 3) NL(L):Ip(M):S(H). Sample S was used as reference sample: thus, it was present in all triplets. Each mix was fractionated by SCX StageTips [22] using Empore SCX Extraction Disks.  Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer coupled online to an Easy nano-LC1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Peptide mixtures (3 µL) were loaded at a flow rate of 500 nL/min onto a silica capillary tip (75 µm i.d., length 10 cm) packed in house with 3 µm C18 silica particles (Dr. Maisch, Germany). Gradient elution was from 8% B (0,1% FA in 80% ACN) to 35% in 55 min, then from 35% B to 100% B in 5 min. Column equilibration (20 min) was at 2% B. MS acquisition was performed in positive ion mode with a nanoelectrospray voltage of 1800 V. Mass spectra were obtained in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, using a top 12 method consisting in a survey full scan across the m/z range 350 - 1800, followed by MS/MS scans on the twelve most intense precursor ions accumulated for a maximum of 60 ms. Full scan acquisition parameters were: 70 000 FWHM, AGC target 1e6, maximum IT 50ms, scan range 350 to 1800 m/z. Instead, dd-MS2 acquisition parameters were set as following: 17 500 FWHM, AGC target 1e5, maximum IT 60 ms, isolation window 1.6 m/z, scan range 200 to 2000 m/z. Collision energy was set at 25%.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were processed by Proteome Discoverer 1.4 using the Sequest algorithm and searched against the protein sequence database of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (June 2015, 6,415 proteins). Search criteria were set as follows: enzyme trypsin, maximum two missed cleavages, Dimethyl (Any N-Terminus), Dimethyl (K), Carbamidomethyl (C) as static modifications (dimethyl modifications were set to either “light”, “medium” or “heavy” in three parallel searches), Oxidation (Met) as dynamic modification, MS tolerance 10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance 0.02 Da. Search results were filtered by q-values using Percolator [23], integrated in Proteome Discoverer (q-value<0.01). Protein hits based on two successful peptide identifications were considered valid. Quantification was performed in Proteome discoverer using default parameters for triplex dimethyl labelling. Normalization of protein ratios was performed by using the median peptide M (or H):L value.
