### Title
Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data for accurate assembly and annotation of genomes

### Description
Deep proteomic analysis of larvae, pupae and 15 adult tissues using high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry provided peptide evidence for ~9,000 computationally predicted genes accounting for 82% of total protein-coding genes in An. stephensi. Transcriptomic profiling of 4 tissues provided transcript evidence for 7,504 computationally predicted gene models and resulted in identification of 3,797 novel transcripts. We also identified protein level evidence for several novel alternative transcripts, SNPs and tissue restricted expression patterns of several proteins in An. stephensi

### Sample Protocol
15 adult mosquito tissues and larvae and pupae were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 100 mM DTT and 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, homogenized, sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The protein concentration of the cleared lysate was estimated using BCA assay and were further fractionated. Proteins from SDS lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion was carried out using trypsin. The peptides were extracted, vacuum dried and stored at -80�C until further analysis. About 500 �g proteins were subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion following reduction and alkylation with DTT and IAA respectively. The peptide digest were then desalted using Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA), lyophilized and fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography using XBridge C18, 5 �m 250 x 4.6 mm column (Waters, Milford, MA). 96 fractions were collected, which were then concatenated, vacuum dried and stored at -80�C until further LC-MS analysis. Two iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic experiments were carried out comparing i) male and female midgut tissues and ii) four tissues (midgut, Malpighian tubules, fat body and ovary) from adult female mosquitoes.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data obtained from all LC-MS/MS analysis were searched against Anopheles stephensi Indian strain protein database (VectorBase version 2.1) and SDA500 protein database containing 11,789 and 13,113 entries respectively, along with common contaminants using Sequest and Mascot (version 2.2) search algorithms through Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Enzyme specificity was set as trypsin with maximum two missed cleavage allowed. The minimum peptide length was specified to be 6 amino acids. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and acetylation of protein N-termini were included as variable modifications. The mass error of parent ions was set to 10 ppm and 0.05 Da for fragment ions for the data analyzed on LTQ-Orbitrap Elite and Q Exactive. However, the mass error of parent ions was set to 20 ppm and 0.1 Da for fragment ions for the data analyzed on LTQ-Orbitrap Velos. The data was also searched against a decoy database and MS/MS identifications of < 1% false discovery rate (FDR) score threshold was considered for further analysis. To enable identification of novel peptides and correction of existing gene annotations in the An. stephensi genome, four alternative databases namely - 1) six frame translated genome database 2) three frame translated RNA-Seq data 3) Hypothetical N-terminal UTR database of protein and genome sequences and 4) Anopheles gambiae protein database (version 3.7). Unmatched MS/MS spectra peaklist files were extracted from the protein database search result and searched against these databases using Sequest and Mascot (version 2.2) search algorithms through Proteome Discoverer 1.4. A decoy database was created for each database by reversing the sequences from a target database. The sequences of common contaminants including trypsin used as protease were appended to the database engine installed locally.
