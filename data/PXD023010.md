### Title
Mouse pluripotent stem cell spectral library for SWATH analysis

### Description
A spectral library of mouse proteins suitable for SWATH analysis. Library comprises spectra from publicly available dataset available on PRIDE obtained from mouse tissue with a new data set acquired from a time course of mouse epithelial cells transitioning to pluripotent stem cells, including markers of transition.   

### Sample Protocol
Mouse epithelial cells were sampled prior to induced pluripotancy, at six days after initiation and a pure  pluripotent stem cell population. Peptides were prepared by gel-LC-MS and spectra acquired on a Sciex 6600 Q-TOF instrument.  

### Data Protocol
A fully documented script enabling repeatable data processing is included with the submission.  In brief spectra were extracted with the sciex wiff converter, searched against the uniprot mouse protein FASTA database with X!Tandem processed through the trans-proteomic pipeline and converted into a spectral library by spectrast.
