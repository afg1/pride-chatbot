### Title
APP/PS1 Mouse Brain Effects of ADAM17

### Description
Affects of ADAM17 AAV9 mediated injection on cognitive and vascular function in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

### Sample Protocol
Mouse whole brain samples were homogenized. Samples were run via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Digested with trypsin; analyzed on Orbitrap Fusion tribrid mass spectrometer with a nano-UPLC system. Eluted peptides were introduced via a nano-electrospray ionization source.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were processed with the Proteome Discoverer software,  with the SequestHT software, run against the SwissProt mouse protein database. The percolator peptide spectrum matching validator algorithm was used for PSM validation.
