### Title
AP-MS of different isoforms of Axin

### Description
This project aims to identify and differentiate the interaction partners of  Axin1 isoforms including 1 wild type and 3 different mutants (L106R, L106R_F119R, deltaRGS).

### Sample Protocol
FLAG- tagged of different isoforms of Axin1 were expressed in the HEK293T cells. Following affinity purification (AP), proteins pulled down were digested and analysed with LC-MS/MS.


### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (MASCOT 2.4 as search engine) was used for identification and spectral counting of the pulled down proteins  validated with a FDR of 1%. The CRAPome was used to compare the multiple samples for proteins that are significantly enriched in a particular isoform of Axin1 against the empty vector (negative control).
