### Title
Region and cell-type resolved quantitative proteomic map of the human heart and its application to atrial fibrillation

### Description
The heart is a central human organ and its diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, but an in-depth knowledge of the identity and quantity of its constituent proteins is still lacking. Here we determine the healthy human heart proteome by measuring 16 anatomical regions and three major cardiac cell types by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics. From low microgram sample amounts, we quantified over 11,000 proteins in this high dynamic range tissue. We combined copy numbers per cell with protein organellar assignments to build a model of the heart proteome at the subcellular level. Analysis of cardiac fibroblasts identified 25 cellular receptors as potential new cell surface markers. Application of our heart map to an atrial fibrillation study revealed signatures of distinct mitochondrial dysfunctions. The heart map is available at maxqb.biochem.mpg.de as a resource for future analyses of normal heart function and disease.

### Sample Protocol
All 16 heart regions and cell types were processed using in stage tip sample preparation and fractionated into 8 fractions using high-pH reversed phase fractionation. About 1 Âµg of peptides were loaded on a 40 cm HPLC-column and measured on a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF).

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched against the 2015 Uniprot human databases using MaxQuant with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide and protein level. Statistical and bioinformatics analysis was performed with the Perseus software. Proteins that were identified in the decoy reverse database or only by site modification were not considered for data analysis.

### Publication Abstract
The heart is a central human organ and its diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, but an in-depth knowledge of the identity and quantity of its constituent proteins is still lacking. Here, we determine the healthy human heart proteome by measuring 16 anatomical regions and three major cardiac cell types by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics. From low microgram sample amounts, we quantify over 10,700 proteins in this high dynamic range tissue. We combine copy numbers per cell with protein organellar assignments to build a model of the heart proteome at the subcellular level. Analysis of cardiac fibroblasts identifies cellular receptors as potential cell surface markers. Application of our heart map to atrial fibrillation reveals individually distinct mitochondrial dysfunctions. The heart map is available at maxqb.biochem.mpg.de as a resource for future analyses of normal heart function and disease.
