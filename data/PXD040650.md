### Title
Proteomic analysis for astroglial exosomes

### Description
LC/MS/MS analysis was performed on astroglial exosome samples (3 biological replicates) to identify proteins expressed on the surface of astroglial exosomes. Thes astroglial exosome samples were purified using size-exclusion column from astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) of primary astrocyte cultures.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, then each sample lane was excised and digested with trypsin and spiked with ADH peptides. The samples were then injected into Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
The data was searched against Swiss-Prot Mouse protein database using Mascot search engine through Proteome discoverer software. The data was exported and normalized as intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) quantitative values in Scaffold (v 4.1)
