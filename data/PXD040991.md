### Title
mu-crystallin interactome in vivo

### Description
To identify how mu-crystallin operates within striatal astrocytes, we used proximity-dependent biotinylation with BioID2 to identify mu-crystallin interacting proteins relative to GFP controls. Strong biotinylation in vivo permitted identification of the 78-protein mu-crystallin interactome, which will be fully reported in a following publication

### Sample Protocol
Each sample was reduced and alkylated by adding TCEP and iodoacetamide to final concentrations of 5 mM and 10 mM, incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min, and then digested by 0.1 μg of Lys-C (Thermo Scientific, 90051) and 0.8 μg Trypsin (Thermo Scientific, 90057) proteases at 37 °C overnight. The digested samples were quenched by the addition of formic acid to 5% (v./v.) final concentration. Finally, each sample was desalted via C18 tips (Thermo Scientific, 87784) and reconstituted in 15 μL of 5% formic acid before analyzed by LC–MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data analysis including peptide and protein identification was performed using MS2 spectra were searched using the ProLuCID algorithm against Amouse reference proteome followed by filtering of peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs) by DTASelect using a decoy database-estimated false discovery rate of <1%.
