### Title
New nodes and edges in the glucosinolate molecular network revealed by proteomics and metabolomics of Arabidopsis myb28/29 and cyp79B2/B3

### Description
In this project we aimed to investigate new connections (edges) in the glucosinolate metabolism molecular network. We studied proteome changes in myb28/29 and cyp79B2/B3 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants as an effect of glucosinolate metabolism perturbation.

### Sample Protocol
Proteomics study performed by extraction of different genotypes proteins using phenol extraction method. The extracted proteins were digested and labeled with iTRAQ 8-plex kit. The labeled peptides were analyzed on LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS/MS analysis data was proceesed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4. Quantitation based on unique peptides was performed. Significant protein changes were considered at p-Value < 0.05 and fold change 1.2 and 0.8 for increased and decreased proteins respectively.
