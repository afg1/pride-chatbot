### Title
A human interactome in three quantitative dimensions organized by stoichiometries and abundances

### Description
The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries and measures cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins, and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Affinity-enrichment and mass spectrometry: HeLa Kyoto cell lines expressing N- or C-terminally GFP tagged proteins from BAC transgenes were generated and cultured as previously described (Poser et al., 2008). Cells were grown to near-confluency on two 15 cm cell culture dishes per interaction experiment, detached with accutase and snap frozen. Three replicates were harvested in at least two different passages. Cell pellets were lysed and subjected to affinity purification on a robotic system, followed by single-shot mass spectrometric analysis on an Orbitrap instrument (Hubner et al., 2010). We processed triplicates separately on different days and carried out MS-analyses in randomized order over the course of weeks to months.  Whole proteome measurements: HeLa cells were lysed in guanidinium chloride lysis buffer and digested sequentially with LysC and trypsin as described (Kulak et al., 2014). Peptides were desalted on stacked C18 reverse phase (Waters Sep-pak) and strong cation exchange cartridges and eluted using 70% acetonitrile. Pooled eluates were separated into six fractions on strong anion exchange (SAX) StageTips (Wisniewski et al., 2010). MS measurements were performed in three replicates on a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Kulak et al., 2014).

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed with MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) (version 1.3.9.10) in several sets, each containing ~600 randomly assigned AP-MS runs and the HeLa proteome fractions. MS/MS spectra were searched against a modified version of the November 2012 release of the UniProt complete human proteome sequence database. For each bait protein expressed from a mouse BAC locus, the human sequence in the fasta file was concatenated with the mouse sequence (unless identical). Human identifiers were used for mapping purposes. We used MaxLFQ, MaxQuant�s label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm to calculate protein intensity profiles across samples (Cox et al., 2014). We required one ratio count for each pair-wise comparison step and activated the FastLFQ setting with two minimum and two average comparisons to enable the normalization of large datasets in manageable computing time.  Protein identifications were filtered, removing hits to the reverse decoy database as well as proteins only identified by modified peptides. We required that each protein be quantified in all replicates from the AP-MS samples of at least one cell line. Protein LFQ intensities were logarithmized and missing values imputed by values simulating noise around the detection limit. For each protein, a non-parametric method was used to select a subset of samples that provide a distribution of background intensities for this protein. This subset was used first to normalize all protein intensities to represent relative enrichment, and then to serve as the control group for a two-tailed Welch�s t test. Specific outliers in the volcano plots of logarithmized p values against enrichments were determined by an approach making use of the asymmetry in the outlier population. We used two cut-offs of different stringencies, representing 1 and 5% of enrichment false discovery rate (FDR), respectively. Correlation coefficients between the intensity profiles of interacting proteins were calculated as additional quality parameters (Keilhauer et al., 2015). Enrichment FDR and profile correlation define the confidence class of an interaction.  Estimating interaction stoichiometries requires the comparison of the amounts of different proteins relative to each other in one IP. We first subtracted the median intensity across all samples to account for background binding. We then divided LFQ intensities by the number of theoretically observable peptides for this protein (Schwanh�usser et al., 2011). Finally, we expressed stoichiometries relative to the bait protein. Cellular copy numbers and abundances were calculated using a similar approach (Wisniewski et al., 2014) on the whole proteome data and brought to absolute scale by normalization to a total protein amount of 200 pg in a cell volume of 1 pl for a HeLa cell.

### Publication Abstract
The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.
