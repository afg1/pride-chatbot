### Title
: Pap test, cervical swab, and tumor tissue LC-MS/MS proteomics from a case of high grade serous ovarian cancer.

### Description
The aim of this study was to determine whether the residual fixative from a liquid-based Pap test or a swab of the cervix contained proteins that were also found in the primary tumor of a woman with high grade serous ovarian cancer.  A total of 4,934 proteins were identified and analyzed. This study is the first step in determining the feasibility of using the liquid-based Pap test or a cervical swab for the detection of ovarian cancer biomarkers

### Sample Protocol
Three different biospecimens were collected from a woman with late stage, high grade serous ovarian cancer and processed for protein isolation and MS analysis. A MerocelTM cervical swab and SurePathTM liquid-based Pap cytology test were collected prior to surgery.  Snap frozen primary ovarian cancer tumor tissue was obtained from the University of Minnesota BioNet Tissue Procurement facility. Proteins were eluted from the MerocelTM swab by soaking it for 30 minutes in 300 ul of phosphate-buffered saline.  The swab plus its washings were added to a Spin-X microtube and centrifuged at 1889 x g in a microfuge for 20 minutes at room temperature.  The eluted proteins were then used in the studies outlined below. Following diagnosis in the Fairview University cytopathology lab, the 2 mL of residual SurePathTM fixative was obtained. The SurePathTM vial was vortexed, then the SurePathTM fluid was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 800 x g to pellet the cells.  The cell-free Pap test fluid was used in the studies outlined below. The proteins eluted from the swab and the cell-free supernatant from the residual Pap test fixative were concentrated by acetone precipitation and the protein pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6 with 0.4% SDS.   A total protein extract was prepared from snap frozen tumor tissue by pressure cycling in a Barocycler. Frozen tumor tissue was ground into a powder on dry ice, and reconstituted in extraction buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 0.4 M TEAB pH 8.5, 20% acetonitrile and 4 mM TCEP at a ratio of 10 ul of extraction buffer per mg of tissue.  The sample was vortexed, sonicated briefly then transferred to a Pressure Cycling Technology tube with a 150 ul cap for the Barocycler NEP2320 and cycled between 35 kpsi for 20 sec and 0 kpsi for 10 sec for 60 cycles at 37 °C. MMTS was added to the PCT tube to a final concentration of 8 mM, inverted several times, and incubated 15 min at RT. The sample was transferred to a new 1.5 mL microfuge Eppendorf Protein LoBind tube and centrifuged at 13000 x g to remove insoluble material.  Proteins from concentrated Pap test and swab samples were trypsin digested and prepared for MS by the Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method using Nanosep Omega centrifugal devices with a 10K MW cut off.  Concentrated Pap test and swab samples (~50 µg protein) were solubilized in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.4% SDS, and reduced by the addition of 10 TCEP at room temperature, alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide and digested 100 overnight at 37°C with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) using an enzyme: protein ratio of 1:100. Peptides were desalted with C18 stage tips and dried under vacuum. Tumor tissue proteins were digested “in solution” as follows:  200 µg of the tumor tissue extract was diluted five-fold with ultra-pure water.  Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) was added in a 1:40 ratio of trypsin to total protein. The sample was incubated for 16 hours at 37 °C. After incubation, the sample was frozen at -80 °C for 30 minutes and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The sample was then cleaned with a 4 mL Extract Clean™ C18 SPE cartridge from Grace-Davidson and the eluate was vacuum dried. Peptides were fractionated offline by high pH C18 reversed-phase chromatography followed by fraction concatenation for 2D proteomic analysis. Briefly, samples were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mM ammonium formate pH 10 in 98:2 water:acetonitrile) and fractionated using a Shimadzu Promenance HPLC with a Hot Sleeve-25L Column and a Security Guard pre-column housing a Gemini NX C18 cartridge attached to a C18 XBridge column, 150 mm x 2.1 mm internal diameter, 5 um particle size.  The flow rate was 200 µl/min with a gradient of 2-5% buffer B (20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 10:90 water:acetonitrile) over 0.5 min, 5-35% buffer B over 57 min, and 35-60% buffer B over 8 min.  Fractions were collected at 2 minute intervals and UV absorbance was monitored at 215 nm and 280 nm, followed by fraction concatenation. Concatenated samples were dried in vacuo, resuspended in load solvent (98:1.99:0.01, water:acetonitrile:formic acid) and run on the LTQ Orbitrap Velos as described in Lin-Moshier et al, 2013 (Journal of Biological Chemistry; 288(1):355-67) except lock mass was not invoked.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data was searched against the human Uniprot canonical and isoform database containing forward and reverse sequences and common contaminants (thegpm.org/crap/index) (Uniprot database version 20161213, 92,719 entries total), using Sequest (XCorr Only) version IseNode in Proteome Discoverer 2.2.0.388 (Thermo Scientific),  with the following settings:  Digestion enzyme, trypsin with one missed cleavage allowed; fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da; precursor ion tolerance of 50.0 ppm; carbamidomethyl of cysteine as a fixed modification.  Variable modifications were pyroglutamic acid of glutamine, deamidation of asparagine, oxidation of methionine, and acetylation of the protein N-terminus. Scaffold version 4.10.0 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications and Scaffold version 4.11.1 was used to export the mzIdentML files
