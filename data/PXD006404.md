### Title
Proteomics analysis of ALK signaling in neuroblastoma cells

### Description
We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to unravel anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signaling in the ALK and MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell line, NB1. We specifically measured the ALK interactome, phosphoproteome, phosphotyrosine interactome and proteome as outlined below. ALK Interactome and phosphoproteome: For each experiment, three SILAC conditions (‘Light’: Lys0,Arg0, ‘Medium’: Lys4,Arg6, ‘Heavy’: Lys8,Arg10) of NB1 cells were treated for 30 minutes with each of the following ALK-targeting small-molecule inhibitors: TAE684 (100 nM), crizotinib (500 nM), and LDK378 (250 nM).  The experiments were performed as specified below:  Experiment 1: Light: 500 nM crizotinib, Medium: 100 nM TAE684, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO Experiment 2: Light: 100 nM TAE684, Medium: 250 nM LDK378, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO Experiment 3: Light: 250 nM LDK378, Medium: 500 nM crizotinib, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO These three triple-SILAC experiments allowed the effect of each inhibitor to be measured in duplicates. ALK phosphotyrosine interactome: To identify phosphotyrosine-specific interaction partners of ALK we used a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. Interacting proteins to the peptide sequences (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptide) indicated in the table below were identified by a peptide pull-down assay and mass spectrometry. Peptide pull-downs were performed on NB1 cell lysate prepared from cells treated for 30 minutes with LDK378 (250 nM) or DMSO. Each peptide pull-down was performed on lysates from two biological replicates.

### Sample Protocol
ALK Interactome and phosphoproteome: For the interactome analysis, SILAC cells were lysed, ALK was immunoprecipitated in parallel for each condition (equal amounts), eluted and mixed. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, gel lanes were excised and cut into 6 fractions for each experiment and in-gel digested with trypsin. Resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer. For the phosphoproteome analysis, SILAC cells were lysed, samples mixed in equal amounts and proteins were in-solution digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Phosphotyrosine enrichment was performed using antibody-based enrichment and from the unbound fraction phosphopeptides were enriched by two sequential incubations with titanium dioxide (TiO2). Resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive Plus orbitrap mass spectrometer. ALK phosphotyrosine interactome: Peptide pull-downs were performed on NB1 cell lysate from DMSO- and LDK378-treated cells with biotinylated peptides coupled to sepharose-streptavidin beads. Pull-downs, elution and on-bead trypsin digestion were all carried out in 96-well multiscreen filter plates essentially as described in Eberl et al. 2013. Resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer. Proteome: NB1 cells were lysed in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and extracted proteins were digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Peptides were fractionated by high-pH fractionation as described in Batth et al. 2014. Resulting peptide mixtures (14 fractions per biological replicate) were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.5.3.33 using the Andromeda search engine.

### Publication Abstract
Oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy resistance to ALK-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the oncogenic signaling network rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK signaling pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple signaling layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the signaling adaptor protein IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI-sensitive signaling node in neuroblastoma cells driven by oncogenic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of oncogenic ALK signaling by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 signaling axis.
