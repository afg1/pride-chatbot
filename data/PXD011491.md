### Title
In vitro and in vivo proteomic comparison of human neural progenitor cell-induced photoreceptor survival

### Description
Retinal degenerative diseases are some of the leading causes of blindness with few treatments. Various cell-based therapies have aimed to slow the progression of vision loss by preserving light-sensing photoreceptor cells. A subretinal injection of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model of retinal degeneration has aided in photoreceptor survival, though the mechanisms are mainly unknown. Identifying the retinal proteomic changes that occur following hNPC treatment will lead to better understanding of neuroprotection. To mimic the retinal environment following hNPC injection, a co-culture system of retinas and hNPCs was developed. Less cell death occurred in RCS retinal tissue co-cultured with hNPCs than in retinas cultured alone, suggesting that hNPCs provide retinal protection in vitro. Comparison of ex vivo and in vivo retinas identified NRF2-mediated oxidative response signaling as an hNPC-induced pathway. This is the first study to compare proteomic changes following treatment with hNPCs in both an ex vivo and in vivo environment, further allowing the use of ex vivo modeling for mechanisms of retinal preservation. Elucidation of the protein changes in the retina following hNPC treatment may lead to the discovery of mechanisms of photoreceptor survival and its therapeutic for clinical applications.

### Sample Protocol
Retinal Samples were lysed using 300 μL of lysis buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), 42 mM potassium chloride, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1x phosphatase inhibitor, and 1x protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich)), homogenized, and sonicated. Further, 60 μL of 10% SDS was added to each sample and incubated for 10 minutes followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 45 minutes. The supernatant was collected, proteins were quantified using a NanoDrop One Analyzer (Thermo-Fisher), and samples were stored at -80˚C. One aliquot of 50 μg of each sample type received 2 μLs of β-galactosidase (2mg/mL) as an internal control. Proteins were digested using the FASP Protein Digestion Kit (Expedeon, San Diego, CA, USA) per manufacturer’s instructions. Desalting of the samples was then performed using an Oasis HLB 96-well plate 30 μm/5mg (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) attached to a vacuum. The plate was equilibrated with 700 μL of methanol and washed 3 times with 1 mL of 0.1% formic acid in water. Samples were prepared by adding 175 μL of 4% phosphoric acid to the plate, and vacuum filtered with 1 mL of 0.1% formic acid. Elution of the samples was performed with 600 μL of 80% hydrogen cyanide/0.1% formic acid in water. Peptide samples were extracted from the elution plate, put into new collection tubes and spun open in a Thermo Savant SPD2010 ˚ Concentrator (Thermo-Fisher) at 5.1 pressure and 45˚C for approximately 6 hours.

### Data Protocol
All of the processed proteomics samples were Raw MS files were first converted to mzXML files using MSConvert. Data files from each sample were searched against the human (media) or rat (retinas) protein database by Trans Proteomic Pipeline Software. The interaction files prepared from Trans Proteomic Pipeline were then input into Skyline daily software. Protein identification was based on 2 or more peptide matches with a false discovery rate < 5%. Relative abundance values for proteins were calculated from peak areas using the Skyline daily MPPReport plugin.

### Publication Abstract
Retinal degenerative diseases lead to blindness with few treatments. Various cell-based therapies are aimed to slow the progression of vision loss by preserving light-sensing photoreceptor cells. A subretinal injection of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model of retinal degeneration has aided in photoreceptor survival, though the mechanisms are mainly unknown. Identifying the retinal proteomic changes that occur following hNPC treatment leads to better understanding of neuroprotection. To mimic the retinal environment following hNPC injection, a co-culture system of retinas and hNPCs is developed. Less cell death occurs in RCS retinal tissue co-cultured with hNPCs than in retinas cultured alone, suggesting that hNPCs provide retinal protection in vitro. Comparison of ex vivo and in vivo retinas identifies nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) mediated oxidative response signaling as an hNPC-induced pathway. This is the first study to compare proteomic changes following treatment with hNPCs in both an ex vivo and in vivo environment, further allowing the use of ex vivo modeling for mechanisms of retinal preservation. Elucidation of the protein changes in the retina following hNPC treatment may lead to the discovery of mechanisms of photoreceptor survival and its therapeutic for clinical applications.
