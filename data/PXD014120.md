### Title
Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of Azospirillum brasilense ntrC mutant under high and low nitrogen conditions

### Description
Azospirillum brasilense is a free-living diazothophic bacterium that associates with important grasses and cereals, promoting plant growth and increasing crop productivity. The nitrogen metabolism in this organism is tightly regulated by the availability of nitrogen and by the Ntr regulatory system. This system comprises the GlnD protein, which is capable of adding uridylyl groups to the PII proteins, GlnB and GlnZ, under limiting nitrogen levels. Under such conditions, the histidine kinase NtrB cannot interact with GlnB and phosphorylate NtrC. When phosphorylated, NtrC is a transcriptional activator of genes involved in metabolism of alternative nitrogen sources. Considering the key role of NtrC in nitrogen metabolism in Azospirillum brasilense, in this work we evaluated the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of the wild type FP2 strain and its mutant ntrC grown under high and low nitrogen. Analysis of the  integrated data identifies, novel NtrC targets, including proteins involved in the response against oxidative stressnm (i.e., glutathione S-transferase and hydroperoxide resistance protein,), underlining the importance of  NtrC to bacterial survival under oxidative stress conditions.

### Sample Protocol
in-solution trypsin digest followed by LC-MS/MS and label-free quantitation

### Data Protocol
QExactive RAW files were processed using MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 as follow: variable modifications methionine oxidation; N-acetylation of protein N-terminal. The first search was performed using 20 ppm error and the main search 6 ppm; maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Protein and peptide FDR threshold of 0.01; Min Unique Peptides: 1; Min Peptide Length: 7; Second peptides option ON; Match between runs ON, with Time Window of 2 min; Label-free quantitation ON, with minimal ratio count 2; iBAQ ON with log fit ON

### Publication Abstract
<i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> is a diazotrophic microorganism capable of associating with roots of important grasses and cereals, promoting plant growth and increasing crop yields. Nitrogen levels and the Ntr regulatory system control the nitrogen metabolism in <i>A. brasilense</i>. This system comprises the nitrogen regulatory proteins GlnD, which is capable of adding uridylyl groups to the PII proteins, GlnB (PII-1) and GlnZ (PII-2), under limiting nitrogen levels. Under such conditions, the histidine kinase NtrB (nitrogen regulatory protein B) cannot interact with GlnB and phosphorylate NtrC (nitrogen regulatory protein C). The phosphorylated form of NtrC acts as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the metabolism of alternative nitrogen sources. Considering the key role of NtrC in nitrogen metabolism in <i>A. brasilense</i>, in this work we evaluated the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of the wild-type FP2 strain and its mutant <i>ntrC</i> grown under high and low nitrogen. Analysis of the integrated data identifies novel NtrC targets, including proteins involved in the response against oxidative stress (i.e., glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase and hydroperoxide resistance protein), underlining the importance of NtrC to bacterial survival under oxidative stress conditions.
