### Title
PSCK9 knockdown in EndoC-bH1 cells time course (DIA secretome time course)

### Description
EndoC-bH1 cells were incubated with control siRNA or PCSK9 siRNA for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Untreated baseline samples were also included. Unpowered exploratory experiment. Sample size: triplicate per condition.

### Sample Protocol
Cell conditioned media was thawed on ice and was concentrated down to ~100 μL using Amicon® Ultra-15 3k MWCO centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma). Buffer exchange into PreOmics iST lysis buffer was performed, followed by incubation at 95°C for 10 min for reduction and alkylation. Protein amounts were normalized using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts from each condition was subjected to enzymatic cleavage for 3 hours by adding equal amounts of endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin in a 1:50 (wt/wt) enzyme:protein ratio. De-salting and purification were performed according to the PreOmics iST protocol on a styrene divinylbenzene reversed-phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) sorbent. Peptides were loaded onto a 25cm IonOpticks Aurora Series emitter Column (25cm x 75u ID, 1.6um C18; IonOpticks, Australia) performed by a Dionex Ultimate 3000 coupled online to an Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source, integrated with a column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach, Germany) maintained at 50°C. Peptides were separated using a non-linear gradient. Orbitrap Exploris 480 was operated in BoxCar Data Independent Acquistion positive mode. BoxCar windows spanned 400-1200m/z space and a total of 48 MS2 DIA variable windows were used.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using SpectronautTM V14.10 with parameters in PE224.setup.
