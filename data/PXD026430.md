### Title
Chemo-proteomics exploration of HDAC degradability by small molecule degraders

### Description
Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecule protein-protein dimerizers that recruit a ubiquitin E3 ligase to a protein of interest for chemically induced degradation. Here we combine systematic exploration of 51 degraders designed to broadly target the HDAC family of proteins with chemo-proteomics, to map the degradability of zinc-dependent HDAC proteins. Our dataset provides chemical leads for targeting HDACs 1-8 and 10, and investigates important aspects of degrader design such as recruited ligase and linker length and position, to assist chemical design prioritization. We discover that targeting HDACs often results in collateral degradation of the multi-protein complexes that HDACs belong to, offering a new mechanism of controlling chromatin structure. This database is an open source resource for facilitating accelerated degrader design and development for this epigenetic class of enzymes.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were treated with DMSO (biological triplicate) or degrader at indicated dose and time (Meta Treatment Table) and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (EPPS) pH 8.5, Protease and Phosphatase inhibitors from Roche) was added to the cell pellets and homogenized by 20 passes through a 21 gauge (1.25 in. long) needle to achieve a cell lysate with a protein concentration between 1 - 4 mg/mL. A micro-BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine the final protein concentration in the cell lysate. 200 µg of protein for each sample were reduced and alkylated as previously described1. Proteins were precipitated using methanol/chloroform. In brief, four volumes of methanol were added to the cell lysate, followed by one volume of chloroform, and finally three volumes of water. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to separate the chloroform phase from the aqueous phase. The precipitated protein was washed with three volumes of methanol, centrifuged and the resulting washed precipitated protein was allowed to air dry. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 4 M Urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, followed by dilution to 1 M urea with the addition of 200 mM EPPS, pH 8. Proteins were first digested with LysC (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 12 hours at room temperature. The LysC digestion was diluted to 0.5 M Urea with 200 mM EPPS pH 8 followed by digestion with trypsin (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 6 hours at 37 °C. Tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Anhydrous ACN was added to each peptide sample to a final concentration of 30% v/v, and labeling was induced with the addition of TMT reagent to each sample at a ratio of 1:4 peptide:TMT label. The 11 or 16-plex labeling reactions were performed for 1.5 hours at room temperature and the reaction quenched by the addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% for 15 minutes at room temperature. Each of the sample channels were combined in a 1:1 ratio, desalted using C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters) and analyzed by LC-MS for channel ratio comparison. Samples were then combined using the adjusted volumes determined in the channel ratio analysis and dried down in a speed vacuum. The combined sample was then resuspended in 1% formic acid and acidified (pH 2 - 3) before being subjected to desalting with C18 SPE (Sep-Pak, Waters). Samples were then offline fractionated into 96 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent LC1260) through an aeris peptide xb-c18 column (phenomenex) with mobile phase A containing 5% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O, and mobile phase B containing 90% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O (both pH 8.0). The 96 resulting fractions were then pooled in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions and these fractions were used for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Data were collected using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled with a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 LC pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled with an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System. Peptides were separated on an EasySpray ES803a/ES803a.rev2 75 μm inner diameter microcapillary column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a 100 µm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with ~ 50 cm of Accucore C18 resin (2.6 µM, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated using a 190 min gradient of 6 - 27% acetonitrile in 1.0% formic acid with a flow rate of 300 or 350 nL/min.  Each analysis used an MS3-based TMT method as described previously. The data were acquired using a mass range of m/z 340 – 1350, resolution 120,000, AGC target 5 x 105, maximum injection time 100 ms, dynamic exclusion of 120 seconds for the peptide measurements in the Orbitrap. Data dependent MS2 spectra were acquired in the ion trap with a normalized collision energy (NCE) set at 35%, AGC target set to 1.8 x 104 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. MS3 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a HCD collision energy set to 55%, AGC target set to 2 x 105, maximum injection time of 150 ms, resolution at 50,000 and with a maximum synchronous precursor selection (SPS) precursors set to 10.

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer 2.2 or 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides. MS/MS spectra were searched against a Swissprot human database (September 2017 or December 2019) with both the forward and reverse sequences. Database search criteria are as follows: tryptic with two missed cleavages, a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.6 Da, static alkylation of cysteine (57.02146 Da), static TMT labelling of lysine residues and N-termini of peptides (229.16293 Da, or 304.2071 Da), and variable oxidation of methionine (15.99491 Da). TMT reporter ion intensities were measured using a 0.003 Da window around the theoretical m/z for each reporter ion in the MS3 scan. Peptide spectral matches with poor quality MS3 spectra were excluded from quantitation (summed signal-to-noise across channels < 100 and resulting data was filtered to only include proteins that had a minimum of 2 unique peptides identified. Reporter ion intensities were normalized and scaled using in-house scripts in the R framework. Statistical analysis was carried out using the limma package within the R framework.

### Publication Abstract
Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecules that recruit a ubiquitin ligase to a target protein for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. While degraders have been developed for many targets, key questions regarding degrader development and the consequences of acute pharmacological degradation remain, specifically for targets that exist in obligate multi-protein complexes. Here, we synthesize a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) degrader library for the chemo-proteomic exploration of acute degradation of a key class of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Using chemo-proteomics, we not only map the degradability of the zinc-dependent HDAC family identifying leads for targeting HDACs 1-8 and 10 but also explore important aspects of degrading epigenetic enzymes. We discover cell line-driven target specificity and that HDAC degradation often results in collateral loss of HDAC-containing repressive complexes. These findings potentially offer a new mechanism toward controlling chromatin structure, and our resource will facilitate accelerated degrader design and development for HDACs.
