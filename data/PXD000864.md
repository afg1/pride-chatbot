### Title
Label-free based proteomic study of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis

### Description
In order to study the protein responsive network to thermal stress, the proteome analysis of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, a kind of anaerobic thermophilic eubacterium, were performed.

### Sample Protocol
The proteins were extracted from the bacteria cultured at 55oC and 75oC, respectively, using lysis buffer containing 8M urea, followed by reductive alkylation with DTT and IAM, and tryptic digestion. The resulted peptides were separated with high-pH RP into 12 fractions, and analyzed using LTQ-Velos-Orbitrap with the acquisition time of 90min under CID fragmentation mode time of 90min under CID fragmentation mode.

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw MS/MS data from each fraction were converted to MGF files using Trans Proteomic Pipeline (TPP v4.6.3) and searched by MASCOT against the database with the proteins of T. tengcongensis downloaded from NCBI. The searching parameters were set as following: tolerance of one missed cleavage of trypsin, Carbamidomethyl (C) as fixed modification and Oxidation (M) as variable modification, the precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm and the product ion mass tolerance 0.6 Da, auto decoy search.
