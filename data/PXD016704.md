### Title
NanoFreeProteomics (NFP) Compared to Conventional nanoLC based proteomics

### Description
We describe the use of conventional flow proteomics (200 uL/min) on an optimized system for the analysis of highly fractionated TMT labeled materials. We compare 20ug injections on column using NanoFreeProteomics (NFP) to 1uL injections on a convenentional nanoLC system

### Sample Protocol
TMT Protoocol from manufacturer was followed in it's entirety

### Data Protocol
The default workflow for processing MS2 based TMT processing in Proteome Discoverer was used for this experiment

### Publication Abstract
None

### Keywords
