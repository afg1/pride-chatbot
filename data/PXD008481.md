### Title
Input control proteome analysis of EPEC infection (LFQ)

### Description
Total proteome analysis to complement phosphoproteomic study aimed at identifying the substrate of NleH1

### Sample Protocol
Infected cells were lyzed, acetone precipated and digested using trypsin overnight. The resulting unbound fractionation from TiO2 enrichment was used to quantify protein levels between samples.

### Data Protocol
Maxquant based identificiation and LFQ quantification of proteome changes.
