### Title
Differential expressed proteins between Mycoplasma bovis different strains

### Description
Comparing differential expressed proteins between Mycoplasma bovis different strains by using label-free method

### Sample Protocol
Mycoplasma cells were harvested from 200 mL of PPLO culture by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 20 min. Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension in 200 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer (4% SDS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6). The solution was homogenized using a Fastprep-24TM automated homogenizer (MP Biomedicals LLC, Santa Ana, CA, USA) and lysed by sonication and boiling for 15 min. Whole-cell proteins were quantified by using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and samples (20 μL) were separated by SDS-PAGE and digested to peptides using the filter-aided sample preparation method.Peptides were separated using an RP-C18 column (10 × 75 μm, 3 μm) and eluted with buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (84% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Easy-nLC system coupled to a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer . MS was performed in positive ion mode. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 with a m/z ratio of 200 and ranging scan range of 300–1800 m/z. The resolution for MS was set to 17,500 at m/z = 200. The generated data were identified and quantified by using the MaxQuant quantitative proteomics software package.Each protein group was set up with 3 biological replicates and the average LFQ intensities were compared as ratios for the comparison of altered expressed proteins. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05 while difference  2 folds
