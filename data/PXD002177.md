### Title
Quantitative analysis of temporal IP and cell lysate using SWATH-MS (1)

### Description
We treated L929 cells with TNF for six time points and the samples containing TNFR1 complexes were collected by affinity purification and analyzed by SWATH-MS. Accurate and consistent quantification across 18 IP samples showed dynamic profiles of the TNFR1 complex components across six time points.

### Sample Protocol
The proteins in IP samples were precipitated with TCA and resolved in 8M urea/50 mM NH4HCO3.After cysteine reduction and alkylation, 8M urea was diluted to 1.6 M, and trypsin was added in the samples for digestion overnight.

### Data Protocol
Wiff files were converted to mzML using AB Sciex MS converter, and then converted to mzXML files using proteoWizard MSConvert. These mzXML files were used for DIA-Umpire analysis. Wiff files were converted to mzXML files using proteoWizard MSConvert for Group-DIA analysis.
