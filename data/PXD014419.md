### Title
The effect of polyethylene glycol 20,000 on protein extraction efficiency of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues

### Description
The optimal conditions and procedures for efficient and reproducible protein extraction of FFPE tissues have not yet been standardised and new sensitive techniques are continually being developed and improved upon. To our knowledge, there is no general agreement as to the choice of detergent or buffer system (and/or addition of PEG 20,000) required for efficient and reproducible protein extraction from human FFPE tissues. Moreover, the effect of PEG 20,000 on protein extraction efficiency has not been evaluated using human FFPE colorectal cancer tissues. This study therefore aims to assess the impact of PEG 20,000 on the protein extraction efficiency, reproducibility, and protein selection bias of the protein extraction buffer used for FFPE colonic resection tissue in label-free LC-MS/MS analysis. The sample pellets were also tested for residual protein, not extracted in the initial extraction. The results show that the absence of PEG 20,000 increases the number of peptides and proteins identified by unfractionated LC-MS/MS analysis, and the method is more reproducible. However, no significant differences were observed with regard to protein selection bias. We propose that studies generating high protein yields would benefit from the absence of PEG 20,000 in the protein extraction buffer.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction and quantification: A total of 12 samples were analysed - whole cell protein lysates as well as sample pellets. The method used for protein extraction was modified from the protocols used by Scicchitano et al. (2009), and Wiśniewski (2013). Briefly, tissue sections were heated on a heating block (65°C for 5 min), followed by tissue deparaffinisation consisting of two consecutive incubations in xylene for 2.5 min and 1.5 min each respectively, at room temperature. Tissue sections were then rehydrated by successive incubations in absolute ethanol, 70% (v/v) ethanol, and twice with distilled water, for 1 min each at room temperature. Slides were placed on tissue paper to absorb excess moisture and the tissues were collected in protein LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, Germany) by scraping the tissue off the glass slides using a clean sterile scalpel blade. Protein extraction buffer (50 mM AmBic (pH 8.0) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 2% (w/v) SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), either with or without addition of 0.5% (w/v) PEG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to the samples at a volume of approximately 20 μl protein extraction buffer per mm3 of tissue (approximately 23 mm3 tissue per sample). Samples were mixed by vortexing and incubated at 99°C in a heating block with agitation set at 600 RPM for 1 hr, after which the samples were cooled/placed on ice before centrifugation at 16,000 x g and 18°C for 20 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant of each sample was transferred to new protein LoBind  tubes and an aliquot taken for protein yield determination. Total protein extracted from the FFPE tissues were quantified using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Before sample processing for LC-MS/MS analysis, protein pellets were solubilised by resuspension in protein extraction buffer (50mM TEAB (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 4% (w/v) SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), either with or without addition of PEG) and incubation at 95˚C for 5 min. Thereafter samples were centrifuged (10,000 x g; 5 min). The supernatant was transferred to protein Lobind tubes and protein quantification performed using the QuantiPro BCA assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  MagReSyn® HILIC/SP3 method with on-bead digestion: MagReSyn® HILIC beads (ReSyn Biosciences, South Africa) were aliquoted into a new tube and the shipping solution removed, beads were then washed with 250μl wash buffer (15% ACN, 100mM Ammonium acetate, pH 4.5) for 1 min then resuspended in loading buffer (30% ACN, 200mM Ammonium acetate pH 4.5). The rest of the process, described hereafter, was performed using a Hamilton MassSTAR robotics liquid handler (Hamilton, Switzerland). A total of 50μg of protein from each sample was transferred to a protein LoBind plate. Protein was reduced with TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which was added to a final concentration of 10mM TCEP and incubated at 60˚C for 1 hour. Samples were cooled to room temperature and alkylated with 10mM MMTS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (room temperature;15 min). HILIC magnetic beads were added at an equal volume to that of the sample and a ratio of 5:1 total protein. The plate was incubated at room temperature on a shaker at 900 RPM for 30 min for binding of protein to beads. After binding, the beads were washed four times with 500μl of 95% ACN for 1 min each. For digestion, (1:10) trypsin (Promega, USA) in 50mM TEAB was added and the plate incubated at 37˚C on shaker for 4 hrs. After digestion, the supernatant containing the peptides was removed and dried down. The samples were resuspended in 0.1% FA and 2.5% ACN. Label–free LC–MS/MS analysis: LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted with a Q-Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-UPLC system. Peptides were dissolved in a solution of 0.1% FA and 2% ACN and loaded on a C18 trap column (PepMap100, 300μm × 5mm × 5μm). Samples were trapped onto the column and washed for 3 min before the valve was switched and peptides eluted onto the analytical column. A gradient of increasing organic proportion was used for peptide separation - chromatographic separation was performed with a Waters nanoEase (Zenfit) M/Z Peptide CSH C18 column (75μm × 25cm × 1.7μm) and the solvent system employed was solvent A (0.1% FA in LC water) and solvent B (0.1% FA in ACN). The multi-step gradient for peptide separation was generated at 300 nL/min. The gradient was then held at 80% solvent B for 10 min before returning it to 2% solvent B and conditioning the column for 15 min. All data acquisition obtained using Proxeon stainless steel emitters. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a capillary temperature of 320°C. The applied electrospray voltage was 1.95 kV. The mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner using XcaliburTM software version 4.2.

### Data Protocol
Raw data containing centroid MS/MS spectra were converted into mgf (Matrix Science, UK) files using msConvert from the ProteoWizard software suite.29 Peak lists obtained from MS/MS spectra were identified using X!Tandem (version X!Tandem Vengeance 2015.12.15.2)30, MS Amanda (version 2.0.0.9706)31, and MS-GF+ (version 2018.04.09)32. The search was conducted using SearchGUI (version 3.3.3)33. Protein identification was conducted against a concatenated target/decoy34 version of the Homo sapiens (73101, >99.9%), Sus scrofa (1, <0.1%) complement of the UniProtKB35 reference proteome (UP000005640; 9606-Homo sapiens) version downloaded on 29/10/2018. The decoy sequences were created by reversing the target sequences in SearchGUI. The identification settings were as follows: Trypsin, Specific, with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages; 10.0 ppm as MS1 and 0.02 Da as MS2 tolerances; fixed modifications: Methylthio of C (+45.987721 Da), variable modifications: Oxidation of M (+15.994915 Da), Deamidation of N and Q (+0.984016 Da), fixed modifications during refinement procedure: Methylthio of C (+45.987721 Da), variable modifications during refinement procedure: Acetylation of protein N-term (+42.010565 Da), Pyrolidone from E (--18.010565 Da), Pyrolidone from Q (--17.026549 Da), Pyrolidone from carbamidomethylated C (--17.026549 Da). All algorithms specific settings are listed in the certificate of analysis available in File S1, Supporting Information. Peptides and proteins were inferred from the spectrum identification results using PeptideShaker (version 1.16.31)36. Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSMs), peptides and proteins were validated at a 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimated using the decoy hit distribution (example of an annotated MS/MS spectrum for a peptide is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information). All validation thresholds are listed in the certificate of analysis (File S1, Supporting Information). Post-translational modification localizations were scored using the D-score37 and the phosphoRS score38 with a threshold of 95.0 as implemented in the compomics-utilities package39 (example of post-translational modification localizations for a peptide is shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information).
