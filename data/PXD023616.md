### Title
Exploration of buffalo CVM Staphylococcus pasteuri proteins during estrus by LC-MSMS

### Description
The exploration of the secretary proteins of Staphylococcus pasteuri during estrus using the SDS page followed by LC-MS/MS.

### Sample Protocol
Bacterial proteins have been precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-acetone precipitation method. The precipitated protein sample were loaded in 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with 0.5% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, then destained until the appropriate background was obtained. The bands were alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate at RT for 30 min. The samples were digested with sequencing grade trypsin from bovine pancreas (Roche, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Desalting of peptides is performed using C18 PierceÂ® Zip tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) before loading in a Nanospray capillary column (PepMapTM RSLC C18, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and subjected to sequencing by MS/MS in Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

### Data Protocol
The spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.2) against the NCBI protein database.
