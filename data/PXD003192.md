### Publication Abstract
<i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> is one of the main etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis (BV). This infection is responsible for a wide range of public health costs and is associated with several adverse outcomes during pregnancy. Improving our understanding of <i>G. vaginalis</i> protein cell surface will assist in BV diagnosis. This study represents the first proteomic approach that has analyzed the exposed proteins on <i>G. vaginalis</i> cell surface using a shaving approach. The 261 <i>G. vaginalis</i> proteins identified using this approach were analyzed with bioinformatic tools to detect characteristic motifs from surface-exposed proteins, such as signal peptides (36 proteins), lipobox domains (17 proteins), LPXTG motifs (5 proteins) and transmembrane alpha-helices (66 proteins). One third of the identified proteins were found to have at least one typical motif of surface-exposed proteins. Furthermore, the subcellular location was examined using two predictors (PSORT and Gpos-mPLoc). These bioinformatic tools classified 17% of the identified proteins as surface-associated proteins. Interestingly, we identified 13 members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, which were mainly involved in the translocation of various substrates across membranes. To validate the location of the <i>G. vaginalis</i> surface-exposed proteins, an immunofluorescence assay with antibodies against <i>Escherichia coli</i> GroEL was performed to reveal the extracellular location of the moonlighting GroEL. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against <i>G. vaginalis</i> Cna protein were produced and used to validate the location of Cna on the surface of the <i>G. vaginalis</i>. These high affinity anti-Cna mAb represent a useful tool for the study of this pathogenic microorganism and the BV.
