### Title
Proteomics of murine melanoma tumor cells upon sphingosine kinase-1 inhibition

### Description
In order to assess the impact of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) expression on melanoma growth, stable SK1 knockdown cells were generated by shRNA, using Yumm 1.7 cells derived from spontaneous murine melanoma driven by Braf activation as well as Pten and Cdkn2a inactivation. Two cell lines silenced for SK1 (shSK1(1) and shSK1(2)) were obtained.

### Sample Protocol
Whole cell extracts of Yumm cells transfected either with shCtrl, shSK1(1) or shSK1(2) (3 replicates each) were prepared by direct lysis in Tris 50 mM, SDS 2% and sonication. Proteins were reduced (DTT 5 mM, 95Â°C, 5 min), alkylated with iodoacetamide 100 mM, fractionated into 10 bands on a 1D-SDS gel, and in-gel digested with trypsin. Peptides were analyzed by liquid nanochromatography (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system, Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a LTQ-Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific, Bremen, Germany).

### Data Protocol
Raw MS files were processed using MaxQuant (v 1.5.3.30) for database search against Mouse entries of the Swissprot database, and validation through the target-decoy approach at a false discovery rate of 5% and 1% for peptides and proteins, respectively. Label-free relative quantification of the proteins across samples was performed in MaxQuant using the LFQ algorithm, and the Perseus software was used for missing value imputation and statistical analysis.
