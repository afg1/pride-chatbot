### Title
Pak3 interactors in human cells during starvation

### Description
Human Pak3-T421E cDNA with a flag tag was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectomine 2000, After 72 hrs of incubation, PAK3 interactors were pulldwon with FLAG antibody. A sample without PAK3 overexpression was used as a negative control. Changes in PAK3 interactions between basal and starvation conditions were studied.

### Sample Protocol
Mass spectrometry was used to investigate PAK3 protein interactors by identifying proteins immunoprecipitated with PAK3. 3xFlag-PAK3 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells by plasmid transfection. After 72 hrs, cells were quickly fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in PBS. The protein was extracted with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 25 mM glycerophosphate, protease & phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PPC1010, Merck)). PAK3 and its interactors were immunoprecipitated using an Anti-Flag antibody (F1804, Sigma) crosslinked to Pierce Protein G Agarose (20398, Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 1 mg of input protein was used. Immune complexes were eluted using 2xLaemmli sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH6.8). Precipitated proteins were run for 5 min in SDS-PAGE, and the whole bands were excised. After acetonitrile dehydration, the gel pieces were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM dithiothreitol and 55 mM iodoacetamide, respectively. In-gel digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an UltiMate® 3000 Rapid Separation LC (RSLC, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) mass spectrometer. Peptide mixtures were separated using a gradient from 92% A (0.1% FA in water) and 8% B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile) to 33% B in 44 min at 300 nL min-1, using a 75 mm x 250 μm i.d. 1.7 mM BEH C18, analytical column (Waters).

### Data Protocol
Peptides were selected for fragmentation automatically by data dependant analysis. Protein identification was performed using the Mascot (Matrix Science) software, searching against a human Swissprot proteome database. Data were validated using Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, OR), and protein abundances were used for pathway analysis with the Reactome database.
