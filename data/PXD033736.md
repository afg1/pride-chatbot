### Title
A remodeled Pol II complex on RNA template

### Description
The wheat Pol II enzyme was purified, and a transcription initiation complex was assembled on the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) RNA template. The transcription initiation complex was characterized using LC-MSMS.

### Sample Protocol
"Pol_II" is purified Pol II complex from wheat germ. "PD" sample represents Pol II components bound to PSTVd RNA.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were matched to NCBI Triticum protein Ref database, using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo) software. Results were filtered by FDR<1.0%.
