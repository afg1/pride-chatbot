### Title
C. albicans mtEXO mutant mitochondria

### Description
Analysis of mitochondrial proteome changes in C. albicans mutants deficient in the main mitochondrial ribonuclease complex.

### Sample Protocol
Mass spectrometry on proteins from isolated mitochondria was preceded by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) using sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), Microcon 30K spin columns (Milipore) and 30µl of protein extract (3µg/µl) per digestion. The LC-MS-MS/MS experiment was performed on an Orbitrap Elite spectrometer (Thermo).

### Data Protocol
Protein concentrations, relative to concentration of mitochondrial porin, were estimated based on MS spectra, with the use of MaxQuant v1.6.17.0 software and built-in LFQ algorithm.
