### Title
Zebrafish plasma analyzed by CE- and LC-MS/MS

### Description
Single analyses of a Zebrafish whole plasma digest were analyzed by both CE-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The identified peptides and their corresponding retention or migration times were used to train a 'blind' retention/migration time model using linear regression. This trained model provided us with information on the migration/retention coefficients resulting from the individual amino acids. All acquired tandem mass spectrometry data was processed in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) embedded in the Taverna scientific workflow manager. The raw data was converted to mzXML using compassXport 3.0 (Bruker) and searched with X!Tandem. The X!Tandem scores were then converted to pepXML, modeled and translated to probabilities for each peptide-spectral match by PeptideProphet. The X!Tandem search was here performed allowing a random error Â±0.5 Da, +1 or +2 Da isotopic error, carbamidomethylation as fixed and oxidation as variable modification and the k-score plug-in.
