### Title
T. pseudoethanolicus response to furfural stress - LC-MS/MS

### Description
Identification of the furfural detoxifying machinery in T. pseudoethanolicus (Tps) by LC-MS/MS based proteomics for engineering cellulolytic microbes involved in bioethanol production.

### Sample Protocol
Tps cells were grown in biological triplicate, proteins extracted via SDS/TCA/Urea modified FASP, and analyzed by 24-hr MudPIT LC-MS. Orbitrap XL was operated in DDA using a high mass accuracy in MS1 scans and LTQ in MS2 scans.

### Data Protocol
Spectra assiged to peptide sequences via SEQUEST/DTASelect. Spectra counts were measured, assigned nSpC values, and imported into JMP genomics to assign significant changers across conditions via ANOVA. Semiquantitative analysis with replication.
