### Title
Glycoproteome of Elongating cotton fiber cells

### Description
Glycoproteins isolated from elongating cotton fiber cells were analyzed using 2D-PAGE followed by MALDI TOF/TOF based protein identification. Protein isoforms were identified using Tandem mass spectrometry. Lectin based Glycopeptide enrichment strategy followed by PNGase catalyzed deglycosylation reaction was employed to assign potential N-linked glycosylation sites.

### Sample Protocol
Concanavalin A Lectin Sepharose was used to selectively isolate glycoproteins from elongating cotton fiber cells. Glycoprotein samples were further resolved using 2D-PAGE gels. Protein spots were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF. Glycoprotein samples were subjected to solution phase tryptic digestion and further the glycopeptides were selectively enriched using CON-A Sepharose. Enriched glycopeptide samples were deglycosylated using PNGase A and F enzymes. Formerly N-linked glycosylated peptides were identified using Nano-LC MALDI TOF/TOF.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were acquired using Ultraflex III MALDI TOF/TOF MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics), further analysis and annotations of the mass spectra were attained using Flex Analysis (version 3) software. Proteins were identified using Biotools (version 3.2) through MASCOT search engine (version 2.3). Mascot DAT files were extracted from individual samples and exported into Scaffold software (version 4.4.1.1). Spectral files were subjected to protein identification using NCBInr and Cotton specific protein databases.

### Publication Abstract
Cotton ovule epidermal cell differentiation into long fibers primarily depends on wall-oriented processes such as loosening, elongation, remodeling, and maturation. Such processes are governed by cell wall bound structural proteins and interacting carbohydrate active enzymes. Glycosylation plays a major role in the structural, functional, and localization aspects of the cell wall and extracellular destined proteins. Elucidating the glycoproteome of fiber cells would reflect its wall composition as well as compartmental requirement, which must be system specific. Following complementary proteomic approaches, we have identified 334 unique proteins comprising structural and regulatory families. Glycopeptide-based enrichment followed by deglycosylation with PNGase F and A revealed 92 unique peptides containing 106 formerly N-linked glycosylated sites from 67 unique proteins. Our results showed that structural proteins like arabinogalactans and carbohydrate active enzymes were relatively more abundant and showed stage- and isoform-specific expression patterns in the differentiating fiber cell. Furthermore, our data also revealed the presence of heterogeneous and novel forms of structural and regulatory glycoproteins. Comparative analysis with other plant glycoproteomes highlighted the unique composition of the fiber glycoproteome. The present study provides the first insight into the identity, abundance, diversity, and composition of the glycoproteome within single celled cotton fibers. The elucidated composition also indirectly provides clues about unicellular compartmental requirements underlying single cell differentiation.
