### Title
Mass spectrometry-based clinical proteomic profiling of thrombotic material obtained by endovascular thrombectomy in patients with ischemic stroke

### Description
Thrombus formation is a dynamic process regulated by flow, blood cells, and plasma proteins. In this study, we have developed a clinical proteomics workflow to characterize the protein cargo of thrombus derived from patients with ischemic stroke.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts were precipitated with methanol/choloroform, and pellets dissolved in 6M Urea, Tris 100mM pH 7.8.  Protein quantitation was performed with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein enzymatic cleavage (10ug) was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37°C for 16 h. Peptides mixtures were separated by reverse phase chromatography using an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump fitted with a 75 μm ID column (Eksigent 0.075 x 250). Samples were first loaded for desalting and concentration into a 0.5 cm length 100 μm ID precolumn packed with the same chemistry as the separating column. Mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a 140 min two step gradient from 5% B to 25% B in 110 min and 25%B to 40% B in 20 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 9 min and 5% B for 14 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using a Sciex 5600 Triple-TOF system. Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 250 ms. Top 30 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set to 100 ms giving a total cycle time of 3.8 s. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 230 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation during 15 s.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data acquisition was performed using AnalystTF 1.5.2 (Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through Protein Pilot TM Software 5.0 (Sciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm 5.0 for database search, Progroup™ for data grouping, and searched against the concatenated target-decoy UniProt human database. False discovery rate was performed using a non lineal fitting method and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global false discovery rate or better. The qualification criteria used to minimize false positive identifications was that proteins were identified with a maximum false discovery rate of 1% at protein level and an unused ProtScore ≥ 2 (corresponding to 99% confidence).

### Publication Abstract
Thrombotic material retrieved from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients represents a valuable source of biological information. In this study, we have developed a clinical proteomics workflow to characterize the protein cargo of thrombi derived from AIS patients. To analyze the thrombus proteome in a large-scale format, we developed a workflow that combines the isolation of thrombus by endovascular thrombectomy and peptide chromatographic fractionation coupled to mass-spectrometry. Using this workflow, we have characterized a specific proteomic expression profile derived from four AIS patients included in this study. Around 1600 protein species were unambiguously identified in the analyzed material. Functional bioinformatics analyses were performed, emphasizing a clustering of proteins with immunological functions as well as cardiopathy-related proteins with blood-cell dependent functions and peripheral vascular processes. In addition, we established a reference proteomic fingerprint of 341 proteins commonly detected in all patients. Protein interactome network of this subproteome revealed protein clusters involved in the interaction of fibronectin with 14-3-3 proteins, TGF&#x3b2; signaling, and TCP complex network. Taken together, our data contributes to the repertoire of the human thrombus proteome, serving as a reference library to increase our knowledge about the molecular basis of thrombus derived from AIS patients, paving the way toward the establishment of a quantitative approach necessary to detect and characterize potential novel biomarkers in the stroke field.
