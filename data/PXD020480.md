### Title
Arabidopsis proteome in the tripartite interaction between cytokinin, light and temperature

### Description
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying dexamethasone-inducible barley cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CaMV35S>GR>HvCKX2) and agrobacterial isopentenyl transferase (CaMV35S>GR>ipt) constructs were profiled to elucidate proteome-wide response to cold stress under different light conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Total protein extracts were prepared as described previously (e.g. Hloušková et al. 2019) and Aliquots corresponding to 2.5 μg of peptide were analyzed by nanoflow C18 reverse-phase liquid chromatography using a 15 cm column (Zorbax, Agilent), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-UPLC system (Thermo) and the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo) as described previously (Hallmark et al., 2020).

### Data Protocol
The measured spectra were recalibrated and searched against the reference Arabidopsis Araport 11 protein database by Proteome Discoverer 2.4, employing Sequest HT or MS Amanda 2.0
