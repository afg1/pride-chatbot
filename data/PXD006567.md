### Title
An Insight into Glyco-microheterogeneity of Plasma von Willebrand Factor (vWF) by Mass Spectrometry

### Description
Von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a plasma glycoprotein, plays essential roles in primary hemostasis, in cooperation with other coagulation factors. The glycosylation affects many biological phases during the protein life-cycle. In this work, we comprehensively characterized the microheterogeneity at all probable N-glycosites in simultaneous with O-glycosites, beside the N-occupancy estimation.An RP-LC-MS/MS system functionalized with CID and HCD tandem mass techniques was utilized. Our results showed gradual glycosylation occupancy along the protein backbone. A total of 181 glycoforms, 173 N-froms and 8 O-forms, were detected and specified into plasma vWF glycosites. Given subtle characterization of site-specific glycoforms is critical for profound understanding the protein biological functions and activity.

### Sample Protocol
The ultrafiltration-based purified protein was subjected to FASP proteolytic digestion using Trypsin. A portion of the resulted digest was N-deglycosylated by PNGase F in either water for protein identification (ID) and peptide fragment fingerprinting (PFF) or 18O-water for N-glycosite occupancy. The other portion was subjected to a home-made HILIC microcolumn to enrich glycopeptides. Both peptide and glycopeptides were online separated and then subjected to CID or HCD fragmentation, respectively.

### Data Protocol
For LC-CID-MS anslysis of N-deglycosylated peptides,pFind software (2.8)was used to process the data. FASTA sequence databases of human vWF (Full lenght, 2813 AAs, or mature, 2050 AAs) were used for protein ID and PFF with FDR 1%. The precursor ion tolerance was 20 ppm, while the fragment ion tolerance was 0.5 Da. Similarly, the 18O-labeled N-deglycopeptides, rsulated from LC-CID-MS, with full trypsin digestion (two missed cleavages), the static modification was carbamidomethylated Cys, while the variable modification were deamidation at Asn and Gln. However, deamidated Asn with +2.988 Da was selected to screen the N-glycosites occupancy. For LC-HCD-MS data analysis of intact glycopeptides, the MS2 exhibiting diagnostic fragments of oxonium ions were selected for further manual investigation with the assistance of PEPTIDEMASS and GlycoMod tools to generate in silico seqence and glycoform structures, respectively. Two fragments, [Pep+GlcNAc]+ and [Pep]+, were screened and specified to N- or O-glycopeptides to varify the peptide ID. Furthermore, the sequential glycosidic bond cleavages were used to specify the glycoform structure. All peak areas were extracted by XIC, regarding the retention time, and used for site-specific relative abundance (SRA) and total relative abundance (TRA) calculation
