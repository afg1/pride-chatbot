### Title
Genoppi: an open-source software for robust and standardized integration of proteomic and genetic data

### Description
This submission contains human protein interaction datasets of four proteins (BCL2, TDP-43, MDM2, PTEN) across three cancer cell lines (G401, T47D, A375) and one iPSC-derived neuronal cell line (glutamatergic patterned induced neuron, GPiN). The data were generated to demonstrate the utility of Genoppi (lagelab.org/genoppi), an open-source computational tool that enables integration of quantitative proteomic results with genetic data. Our analyses show a general pattern of both cell-type-independent and cell-type-specific interactions for the tested proteins. In particular, our results suggest that the neuron-specific interactions of BCL2 and TDP-43 are mediating their genetic involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### Sample Protocol
For each immunoprecipitation, 1-2 mg of protein extract was incubated at 4°C overnight in the presence of 1-2 μg of the relevant antibody. On the next day, 50 μL of Protein G beads (Pierce) were added to each sample and incubated at 4°C for 4 hours. Flow-through was collected and beads were washed once with 1 mL lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher), and twice with PBS. Beads were resuspended in 60 μL of PBS and 10% of the volume was employed for immunoblotting, after being boiled in 6xSMASH buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 1% b-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at 95ºC. The remaining volume was stored at -80°C and subsequently used for MS analysis. To prepare the samples for LC-MS/MS, PBS was removed and samples were dissolved in 50 µL TEAB (triethylammonium bicarbonate, 50 mM) buffer, followed by trypsin (Promega) digestion for 3 hours at 38°C. Digested samples were dried to 20 µL and 10 µL. LC-MS/MS was performed on a Lumos Tribrid Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher) nano-HPLC. Peptides were separated onto a 150-µm inner diameter microcapillary trapping column, packed with approximately two cm of C18 Reprosil resin (5 µm, 100 Å, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany), followed by separation on a 50-cm analytical column (PharmaFluidics, Gent, Belgium). Separation was achieved through applying a gradient from 5–27% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 90 min at 200 nL min^−1. Electrospray ionization was enabled through applying a voltage of 2 kV using a home-made electrode junction at the end of the microcapillary column and sprayed from metal tips (PepSep, Denmark). Mass spectrometry survey scan was performed in the Orbitrap, in a range of 400–1,800 m/z at a resolution of 6 x 10^4, followed by the selection of the 20 most intense ions (TOP20) for CID-MS2 fragmentation in the ion trap using a precursor isolation width window of 2 m/z, AGC setting of 10,000, and a maximum ion accumulation of 100 ms. Singly charged ion species were not subjected to CID fragmentation. Normalized collision energy was set to 35 V and an activation time of 10 ms. Ions within a 10 ppm m/z window around ions selected for MS2 were excluded from further selection for fragmentation for 60 s.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Scientific). Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using the Sequest HT algorithm by searching the data against a protein sequence database including all entries from the Uniport_Human2018_SPonly database as well as other known contaminants such as human keratins and common laboratory contaminants. Quantitative analysis between samples was performed by label-free quantitation (LFQ) between different sets of samples. Sequest HT searches were performed using a 10 ppm precursor ion tolerance and requiring each peptide’s N/C-termini to adhere with trypsin protease specificity, while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as variable modification. A MS2 spectra assignment false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was applied to both proteins and peptides using the Percolator target-decoy database search.

### Publication Abstract
Combining genetic and cell-type-specific proteomic datasets can generate biological insights and therapeutic hypotheses, but a technical and statistical framework for such analyses is lacking. Here, we present an open-source computational tool called Genoppi (lagelab.org/genoppi) that enables robust, standardized, and intuitive integration of quantitative proteomic results with genetic data. We use Genoppi to analyze 16 cell-type-specific protein interaction datasets of four proteins (BCL2, TDP-43, MDM2, PTEN) involved in cancer and neurological disease. Through systematic quality control of the data and integration with published protein interactions, we show a general pattern of both cell-type-independent and cell-type-specific interactions across three cancer cell types and one human iPSC-derived neuronal cell type. Furthermore, through the integration of proteomic and genetic datasets in Genoppi, our results suggest that the neuron-specific interactions of these proteins are mediating their genetic involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, our analyses suggest that human iPSC-derived neurons are a relevant model system for studying the involvement of BCL2 and TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
