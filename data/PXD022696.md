### Title
The distinct N-terminomes of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms.

### Description
In this study we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize the natural N-terminome of newborn and adult Bothrops jararaca venoms.

### Sample Protocol
• N-terminomic analysis of B. jararaca venom from newborn and adult specimens:  The venom proteins were submitted to denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride, the disulfide bonds were reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT) and the cysteine residues were carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide (IAA). For labeling, protein N-termini were submitted to dimethylation using formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. Proteins from newborn venom were labeled with light formaldehyde (12CH2O), resulting in a mass shift of 28.031300 Da, and proteins from adult venom were labeled with heavy formaldehyde (13CD2O), resulting in a mass shift 34.068960 Da. After the dimethylation step, the proteins were cleaned by precipitation and the samples from adult and newborn venoms were mixed in one single tube for trypsin digestion. To perform the depletion of tryptic peptides, the samples were applied to an aldehyde-activated crosslinked 4% beaded agarose resin and the natural N-terminal peptides were collected from the flow through fraction since they did not bind to the resin due their blocked/dimethylated N-termini. • Peptide desalting and fractionation: Peptide samples were desalted and/or fractionated by stage tip with the membrane set C18-SCX-C18. • LC-MS/MS: All LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in an EASY II-nanoLC system coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were injected in a 3.5 cm C18 trap column (100 μm I.D. × 360 μm O.D.) and the chromatographic peptide separations were performed on 10 cm long columns (75 μm I.D. x 360 μm O.D.) packed in-house with 5 μm Aqua C-18 beads (Phenomenex).

### Data Protocol
All data analyses were performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.14.0) and Perseus (version 1.6.13.0).

### Publication Abstract
Using approaches of transcriptomics and proteomics we have shown that the phenotype of Bothrops jararaca venom undergoes a significant rearrangement upon neonate to adult transition. Most regulatory processes in biology are intrinsically related to modifications of protein structure, function, and abundance. However, it is unclear to which extent intrinsic proteolysis affects toxins and snake venom phenotypes upon ontogenesis. Here we assessed the natural N-terminome of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms and explored the degree of N-terminal protein truncation in ontogenetic-based proteome variation. To this end we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize venom collected in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. We identified natural N-terminal sequences in the newborn (71) and adult (84) venoms, from which only 37 were common to both. However, truncated toxins were found in higher number in the newborn (212) than in the adult (140) venom. Moreover, sequences N-terminally blocked by pyroglutamic acid were identified in the newborn (55) and adult (49) venoms. Most toxin classes identified by their natural N-terminal sequences showed a similar number of unique peptides in the newborn and adult venoms, however, those of serine proteinases and C-type lectins were more abundant in the adult venom. Truncated sequences from at least ten toxin classes were detected, however the catalytic and cysteine-rich domains of metalloproteinases were the most prone to proteolysis, mainly in the newborn venom. Our results underscore the pervasiveness of truncations in most toxin classes and highlight variable post-translational events in newborn and adult venoms.
