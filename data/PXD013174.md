### Title
DMD Biomarkers in  4 years boys, DMD vs. Control study

### Description
The aim of this project is to identify biomarkers in serum samples of very young DMD boys (4 years old)

### Sample Protocol
From a nominal value of 50 Î¼g of depleted serum protein per sample, the proteins are denatured with SDS, reduced with TCEP and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The proteins contained in these different preparations are precipitated using cold acetone. Once rid of their supernatants (containing SDS, TCEP, iodoacetamide, etc.), the proteins are reconstituted in a buffer (TEAB) adapted to enzymatic digestion using trypsin. The proteins are then digested in solution with porcine trypsin. The peptides obtained will be derivatized using different isotopes of TMT sixplex (Tandem mass tag). In other words, each sample will be labeled with one of the isotopes of the TMT sixplex (the labeling is done on the lysines and on the N-terminal side of each peptide), 6 TMT isotopes making it possible to simultaneously quantify 6 samples. Once derivatization is complete, the samples were mixed by 6, in relation to the different TMT reporters, 126, 127, 128, 129, 129, 130. The product of these mixtures have been fractionated into 16 fractions on a C18 reverse column for more resolution to identify low concentration proteins. The fractions have been dried and reconstituted later in appropriate buffer and mass spectrometric analysis done.

### Data Protocol
All data files (*.raw) collected were processed with a specific workflow designed in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS data was interpreted using Sequest HT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with precursor and fragment mass tolerance respectively set at 10 ppm and 0.05 Da and the following dynamic modifications: carbamidomethyl on cysteine, Acetyl on protein N-terminal, oxidation on methionine, TMT 6plex modification on lysine as well as N-terminus of peptides. Searches were performed against Homo sapiens (TaxID = 9606) protein sequences downloaded from www.uniprot.org at the 15th November 2017 (42182 entries). The target-decoy database search allowed us to control and to estimate the false positive discovery rate at 1% for peptide and protein as well. For the quantitation method of fourplex (126, 127, 128, 129), fiveplex (126, 127, 128, 129, 130) and sixplex (126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131) were setup in Proteome Discoverer by the deactivation of used channels from original TMT 6plex quantification method. The reporter ions quantifier tolerance was set at 0.05 Da with integration method as the most confident centroid. The peptide used for the quantitation are only unique peptides and spectra with missing channels were rejected for the quantitation. The reporter abundance was based on signal to notice values or intensities. The reporter quantitation was corrected with isotopic impurity of reporter values for minimum signal to notice ratio set at 1.5. The protein abundance was calculated as sum of abundance of the corresponding protein in each fraction. The final abundance of protein was normalized abased on the control sample labeled with TMT 126, the which is sample shared in common between all multiplex runs, the sample we selected for the normalization of the data.

### Publication Abstract
Blood-accessible molecular biomarkers are becoming highly attractive tools to assess disease progression and response to therapies in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) especially in very young patients for whom other outcome measures remain subjective and challenging. In this study, we have standardized a highly specific and reproducible multiplexing mass spectrometry method using the tandem mass tag (TMT) strategy in combination with depletion of abundant proteins from serum and high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation. Differential proteome profiling of 4 year-old DMD boys (<i>n</i> = 9) and age-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 9) identified 38 elevated and 50 decreased serum proteins (adjusted <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, FDR &lt;0.05) in the DMD group relative to the healthy control group. As expected, we confirmed previously reported biomarkers but also identified novel biomarkers. These included novel muscle injury-associated biomarkers such as telethonin, smoothelin-like protein 1, cofilin-1, and plectin, additional muscle-specific enzymes such as UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase PKM, lactotransferrin, tissue alpha-l-fucosidase, pantetheinase, and ficolin-1, and some pro-inflammatory and cell adhesion-associated biomarkers such as leukosialin, macrophage receptor MARCO, vitronectin, galectin-3-binding protein, and ProSAAS. The workflow including serum depletion, sample processing, and mass spectrometry analysis was found to be reproducible and stable over time with CV &lt; 20%. Furthermore, the method was found to be superior in terms of specificity compared to other multiplexing affinity-based methods. These findings demonstrate the specificity and reliability of TMT-based mass spectrometry methods in detection and identification of serum biomarkers in presymptomatic young DMD patients.
