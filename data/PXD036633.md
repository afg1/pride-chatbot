### Title
Human salivary proteome to map biomarker for ectopic pregnancy

### Description
Explore the profile of salivary proteins with an attention during ectopic pregnancy adopting gel based protein mass spectrometry

### Sample Protocol
The trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-acetone method was used to precipitate salivary proteins. Salivary proteins were identified using 12 % SDS-PAGE on protein samples, followed by trypsin digestion on separated proteins in gels that were then subjected to MS/MS sequencing in Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS spectra were analysed using Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.2) and the NCBI protein database.
