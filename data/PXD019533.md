### Title
Multiplexed quantitative proteomics in mouse model of aging

### Description
Characterization of the heart proteome in a mouse model of aging

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts were obtained by homogenizing tissue in lysis buffer and samples were subjected to tryptic digestion using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) technology (Expedeon), which for mouse samples was adapted for oxidized Cys labeling (Bonzon-Kulichenko et al., 2020). Eluted and cleaned-up peptides were subjected to isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) 8-plex labeling (AB Sciex).The tryptic peptide mixtures were subjected to nanoscale liquid chromatography on an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to either an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer or a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified using the SEQUEST HT algorithm integrated in Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SEQUEST results were analyzed by the probability ratio and refined methods (Bonzon-Kulichenko et al., 2015; Martínez-Bartolomé et al., 2008; Navarro & Vázquez, 2009). Comparative analysis of protein abundance changes was conducted with the SanXoT software package (Trevisan-Herraz et al., 2019) based on the Weighted Scan-Peptide-Protein (WSPP) statistical model (Navarro et al., 2014). For the study of coordinated protein alterations, we used the Systems Biology Triangle (SBT) model (García-Marqués et al., 2016).

### Publication Abstract
Aging is the main risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, which have become a global concern as the world population ages. These diseases and the aging process are exacerbated in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS or progeria). Here, we evaluated the cardiometabolic disease in animal models of premature and normal aging with the aim of identifying alterations that are shared or specific to each condition. Despite differences in body composition and metabolic markers, prematurely and normally aging mice developed heart failure and similar cardiac electrical abnormalities. High-throughput proteomics of the hearts of progeric and normally aged mice revealed altered protein oxidation and glycation, as well as dysregulated pathways regulating energy metabolism, proteostasis, gene expression, and cardiac muscle contraction. These results were corroborated in the hearts of progeric pigs, underscoring the translational potential of our findings, which could help in the design of strategies to prevent or slow age-related cardiometabolic disease.
