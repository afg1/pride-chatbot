### Title
O-linked glicoproteomics of gastric cancer cell lines OCUM-1, N87 and KATO-III

### Description
Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, continuously requiring innovative target therapies. The sialyl-lewis A (SLeA) antigen offers tremendous potential for precise cancer targeting. This glycan is rarely expressed by healthy tissues and blood cells but is often present in cancer cells of high metastatic potential as well as in the metastasis. To improve further on the gastric cancer nature of this glycan we have zoomed in on the SLeA-glycoproteome envisaging the identification of possible targetable biomarkers. SLeA-glycoproteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from well-known cell models of gastric cancer reflecting different histological subtypes of the disease (KATO-III, OCUM-1 and N87 cells). Glycoproteins with affinity for E-selectin were also isolated and analyzed. Proteomics study employed a typical nanoLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS platform. The well-known molecular heterogeneity of these cell lines was reflected in the markedly different glycoproteomics signatures observed. Nevertheless, a restricted panel of SLeA-expressing glycoproteins with affinity for E-selectin remained conserved between the cell lines, consisting of a promising list of potentially targetable biomarkers for bladder cancer.

### Sample Protocol
Human gastric cancer cell line OCUM-1 was purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, whereas N87 and KATO-III were acquired from ATCC. Cells were maintained with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 Units/mL penicillin; 10 000 mg/mL streptomycin) supplemented RPMI 1640+GlutaMAXTM-I medium. OCUM-1 cells were grown with Low glucose DMEM (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Cell lines were cultured at 37������C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were lysed using a 20mM HEPES, 10mM KCl, 2mM MgCl2, 1mM EDTA and 1mM EGTA buffer and passed through a 27-gauge needle. Plasma membrane proteins were obtained by differential centrifugation at 100,000g. The pellets were then re-suspended in TBS with 0.3% SDS. The sialyl-lewis A (SLeA) expressing glycoproteins were isolated from plasma membrane enriched extracts (200 microg) by immunoprecipitation using the anti-SLeA monoclonal antibody [CA19.9-9-203] (ab116024, Abcam) immobilized at the surface of magnetic beads with the Pierce��������� Direct IP Kit (26148, ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer���������s instructions. In parallel, a similar strategy was used to pull-down glycoproteins with affinity for E-selectin, using a recombinant mouse E-selectin/ human Fc chimera (E-selectin-Ig chimera-E-Ig), a validated tool to identify E-selectin ligands in human cells (Carrascal et al., 2018; Thankamony and Sackstein, 2011). The glycoproteins isolated in these assays were then resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4���������20% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Tryptic digestion after reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodacetamide followed standard protocols. The digests were finally analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. The nanoLC system (Dionex, 3000 Ultimate nano-LC) was coupled on-line to a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (EASY-Spray source). Eluent A was aqueous formic acid (0.2%) and eluent B was formic acid (0.2%) in acetonitrile. Samples (2 microg) were injected directly into a trapping column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 ������m particle size) and washed over with an isocratic flux of 95% eluent A and 5% eluent B at a flow rate of 30 ������l/min. After 3 minutes, the flux was redirected to the analytical column (EASY-Spray C18 PepMap, 100 ������, 150 mm x 75������m ID and 3 ������m particle size) at a flow rate of 0.3 ������l/min. Column temperature was set at 35������ C. Peptide separation occurred using a linear gradient of 5���������40% eluent B over 117 min., 50���������90% eluent B over 5 min. and 5 min. with 90% eluent B. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode, with a spray voltage of 1.9 kV and a transfer capillary temperature of 275������C. Tube lens voltage was set to 120 V. MS survey scans were acquired at an Orbitrap resolution of 60,000 for an m/z range from 300 to 2000. Tandem MS (MS/MS) data were acquired in the linear ion trap using a data dependent method with dynamic exclusion: The top 6 most intense ions were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID). CID settings were 35% normalized collision energy, 2 Da isolation window 30 ms activation time and an activation Q of 0.250. A window of 90 s was used for dynamic exclusion. Automatic Gain Control (AGC) was enabled and target values were 1.00e+6 for the Orbitrap and 1.00e+4 for LTQ MSn analysis. Data were recorded with Xcalibur software version 2.1.

### Data Protocol
Data was analyzed automatically using the SequestHT search engine with the Percolator algorithm for validation of protein identifications (Proteome Discoverer 1.4, Thermo Scientific). Data was searched against the human proteome obtained from the SwissProt database, selecting trypsin as the enzyme and allowing up to 2 missed cleavage sites and a precursor ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 0.6 Da for product ions. Carbamidomethylcysteine was selected as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine (+15.9) and modifications of serine and threonine with HexNAc (+203.079; Tn antigen), HexNAc-NeuAc (+494.175; sialyl-Tn antigen), HexNAc-Hex (+365.132; T antigen), Hex-Fuc-HexNAc (+511.190, fucosyl-T antigen), HexNAc-Hex-NeuAc ( +656.228, sialyl-T antigen), HexNac(NeuAc)-Hex-NeuAc (+947.323, disialyl-T antigen), HexNAc(Hex)-HexNAc(Fuc)-Hex(NeuAc) (+ 1167.418, core 2 substituted with a terminal SLeA epitope) were defined as variable modifications. The results corresponded to proteins identified with high confidence showing glycopeptides with SLeA as post-translational modification (PTM).
