### Title
Metabolic traits of size-fractionated microbial communities at an oceanic deep chlorophyll maximum waters revealed via metaproteomics

### Description
we applied metaproteomic approach to capture proteins from three size-fractionated microbial communities at the DCM in the basin of the South China Sea. The deep recovery of proteomes from a marine DCM plankton assemblage provides the highest resolution of metabolic activities as well as microbial niche differentiation, revealing a spectrum of biological processes carrying out by microbes at DCM of the SCS.

### Sample Protocol
1.Field survey and sampling 2.Protein extraction, separation and LC-ESI-MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Acquired MS data were converted to MGF files by Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the exported MGF files were searched using Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience; London, UK). Relative abundance of a protein was calculated as follows: unique spectral counts of a protein was divided by the protein length and further percentage normalization within the sample.
