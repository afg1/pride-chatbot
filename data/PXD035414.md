### Title
Abe_et_al_Nature_Communications_2022_mass_spectrometry_rawdata

### Description
This is supplemental raw data for Abe et al., 2022. Proteome analysis and phospho-proteome analysis using mouse liver prepared at 6 circadian time points (CT2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22). In the delta-RRE mutant, two RRE sequences are removed from 5'UTR of mouse Bmal1 gene.

### Sample Protocol
Please see the original paper for the detailed description. In brief, for total proteome analysis, proteins were digested by trypsin and the peptides were subjected to nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. For phospho-proteome analysis, phospho-peptides were enriched before nano-LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Please see the original paper for the detailed description. We used Proteome Discoverer 2.2.
