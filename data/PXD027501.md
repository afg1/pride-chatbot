### Title
Emiliania huxleyi proteomic database quality control

### Description
This dataset consists of spectra derrived from whole-cell extracts of Emiliania huxleyi. They were used to perform quality control check on the predicted proteomes used as databases for protein identification.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were extracted in several differnt detergents, in combination with sonication. FASP or in-solution digest was used to prepare samples for mass spectrometry. In addition, some coccolith associated protein samples were analysed.

### Data Protocol
Data were analysed using searches with Comet and downstream processing with the TPP. Processing with different databases (JGI or the new E.huxleyi database) was compared.
