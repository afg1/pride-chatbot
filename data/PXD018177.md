### Title
A quantitative proteomic analysis to reveal effects of N-acetylcystein on H2O2-induced neurotoxicity

### Description
SK-N-MC cell was used to evaluate effects of N-acetylcystein on H2O2-induced neurotoxicity. Proteomic analysis was conducted in three groups: control, H2O2-treatment (disease group), and NAC pretreatment followed by H2O2-treatment (NAC group).

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were digested to peptides using automated FASP. The peptides from all samples were combined, fractionated, and analyzed using Q-Exactive (DDA MS). The spectra were used to build a library for DIA MS.

### Data Protocol
DDA MS data were processed using Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (Comet + PeptideProphet + ProteinProphet). Skyline was used to build the spectra library and quantify peptides and proteins. MSstats was used for calculation and statistical analysis.
