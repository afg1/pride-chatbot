### Title
An Mtw1 C terminal motif is cruical for cooperative outer kinetochore assembly in budding yeast

### Description
We employed chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry on in vitro reconstituted outer kinetochore KMN network.

### Sample Protocol
A full KMN network was cloned using a biGBac system and expressed in insect cells. Purified complex was crosslinked in solution using BS3 crosslinker followed by digestion. Peptides were enriched on a size exclusion column.

### Data Protocol
Crosslinks were identified using xQuest software. The results were filtered: delta score </= 0.85, MS1 tolerance window -4 to 4 ppm and score </= 22. Filtered results were manually validated and the network was visulized using xVis webserver.
