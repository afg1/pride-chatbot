### Title
Sequential Waves of Protein Phosphorylation Functionally Rewire the Proteome to Drive Gametogenesis

### Description
Using phosphoproteomics, we show that regulated waves of protein phosphorylation affect virtually all cellular functions to supoort meiotic entry, meiotic progeression and gamete morphogenesis.

### Sample Protocol
SK1 wild-type, pachythene arrested and metaphase I arrested cells were collected in meiosis at OD=3.5; proteins were extracted by bead beating in 8M urea/AmBic and reduced/alkylated by TCEP/IAA; digestion was performed with trypsin and peptides were C18 cleaned up ("non-enriched" samples); peptides were phospho-enriched on TiO2/Lactic acid and C18 cleaned up ("phospho-enriched" samples); data were acquired in DDA or SWATH mode on TripleTOF 5600 or 6600 using 1hr gradient

### Data Protocol
DDA files were searched with Comet and Mascot; search results were combined with iProphet and converted to spectral library using spectraST. Transition list included the 5 most intense fragments for each precursor. SWATH files were extracted with openSWATH and re-aligned with TRIC; phospho-peptides were controled for the number of peak clusters detectable per file; final peptide and protein matrices were generated using R
