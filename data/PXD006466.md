### Title
A quantitative label-free analysis of the extracellular proteome of human supraspinatus reveals damage to the pericellular and elastic fibre niches in torn and aged tendons

### Description
Tears of the human supraspinatus tendon are common and often cause painful and debilitating loss of function. Progressive failure of the tendon leading to structural abnormality and tearing is accompanied by numerous cellular and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) changes in the tendon tissue. This proteomics study aimed to compare torn and aged rotator cuff tissue to young and healthy tissue, and provide the first ECM inventory of human supraspinatus tendon generated using label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS. Employing two digestion protocols (trypsin and elastase), we analysed grain-sized tendon supraspinatus biopsies from older patients with torn tendons and from young controls. Our findings confirm measurable degradation of collagen fibrils and associated proteins in old and torn tendons, suggesting a significant loss of tissue organisation. A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, raising the possibility that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy.

### Sample Protocol
Rice-grain sized tendon tissue biopsies, approximately 1x2 mm in size, and rinsed with cold phosphate buffered saline to remove residual blood proteins, transferred to screw-cap vials and suspended in 1.5 ml of strong chaotropic solution for 2 hours at room ambience (4 M GuHCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 44 mM sodium acetate). To homogenise the tissue biopsies, samples were vortexed and processed using an automated tissue homogeniser. Thereafter, samples were centrifuged at a low speed for 5 minutes to collect dissociated tissue from the rotor/stator cup of the tube. The homogenisation procedure was repeated twice. Tubes were briefly vortexed and 0.5 ml of each sample was transferred to a low-binding microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 x g and 4°C. Protein material was then precipitated using Methanol/Chloroform. Resulting protein pellets were re-suspended in 100 ml 6 M Urea in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8. Following reduction with 10 mM DTT, cysteine residues were alkylated using a final concentration of 40 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were diluted with water to a final urea concentration of 0.67 M, and either trypsin (0.66 µg/sample,) or elastase (1 µg/sample) were added. Digestion was carried out at 37°C overnight, after which samples were observed to be completely solubilised. Following acidification with formic acid (0.1% final concentration), obtained peptides were purified on a C18 reverse phase column, dried and re-suspended in 20 ml 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water. Each biological sample was analysed in triplicates. In order to make sure equivalent amounts of protein were analysed from each sample, total ion counts (TIC) was calculated using scout runs, and values were used to adjust the injection volume for the analytical sample runs. Equal amounts of peptide material were analysed by UPLC online coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Scientific) as described previously. Peptides were eluted by applying a 60 min linear gradient from 3% buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 40% buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) on a 25 cm BEH130 C18 column, 1.7-mm particle size. CID was induced on the twenty most abundant ions per full MS scan.

### Data Protocol
All mass spectra of label-free samples were extracted by Progenesis LC-MS, and then analysed by Mascot (Matrix Science), which was set up to search against all human Swiss Prot database entries with the following parameters: Trypsin or no enzyme search for trypsin and elastase samples, respectively; fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (cysteine), variable modifications: Oxidation (proline, lysine) and allysine (lysine). Normalization between samples was achieved using the TIC of each individual sample. Criteria to ensure accurate identification of tendon proteins included a minimum of 2 peptides per protein and a confidence score cut-off of 20. One-way ANOVA was used to calculate the p-value based on the normalized abundance, and a Tukey post-test was performed, providing an adjusted P value to account for multiple comparisons. An adjusted ANOVA score of at least 0.05 between experimental groups was used to identify proteins significantly modulated in torn tendon. Proteins were grouped based on their protein class using the PANTHER database of protein families (version 10) and the Matrisome project, and protein interactions were identified using STRING version 10.0.

### Publication Abstract
Tears of the human supraspinatus tendon are common and often cause painful and debilitating loss of function. Progressive failure of the tendon leading to structural abnormality and tearing is accompanied by numerous cellular and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) changes in the tendon tissue. This proteomics study aimed to compare torn and aged rotator cuff tissue to young and healthy tissue, and provide the first ECM inventory of human supraspinatus tendon generated using label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS. Employing two digestion protocols (trypsin and elastase), we analysed grain-sized tendon supraspinatus biopsies from older patients with torn tendons and from healthy, young controls. Our findings confirm measurable degradation of collagen fibrils and associated proteins in old and torn tendons, suggesting a significant loss of tissue organisation. A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, suggesting that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon as previously thought. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy.
