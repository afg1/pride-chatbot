### Title
Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2 Compartive Proteomics LC-MS/MS

### Description
Comparative analysis between the protein composition of L. johnsonii N6.2's cell membrane and nanovesicle.

### Sample Protocol
500 mL L. johnsonii N6.2 cultures were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min, at 4°C and the cell pellet was stored at -80°C until cell fractionation was needed. The supernatant was filter-sterilized (0.2 µm) to ensure the removal of residual bacterial cells. The filtered supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 175,000 x g for 2 h, at 4°C. The resulting NV pellets were washed twice with PBS using the same parameters in previous ultracentrifugation steps. For fractionation of the L. johnsonii N6.2 whole cells, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and subjected to cell lysis using a French press. The resulting lysed suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min, at 4°C. The supernatant (cell-free extract/ total protein extract, TE) was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 175,000 x g for 2 h, at 4°C. The pellet contained the cell membrane (CM) fraction. The pellet was washed twice with PBS using previous ultracentrifugation parameters and then stored at -80°C. 3 mg of NV and CM pellet were resuspended in 1x Laemmli buffer (1M Tris pH 6.8, 100% glycerol, β-mercaptoethanol, DTT, SDS, and 0.005% bromophenol blue). The resulting suspension was incubated in a water bath at 40°C for 30 min. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was conducted using the mini-PROTEAN Tetra cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Fifteen µL of each sample (Total Extract, Intracellular Extract, Cell Membrane and Nanovesicles) was loaded into the corresponding wells, separating through a homogeneous SDS-PAGE gel (12.5%) for 40 mins at 200 V. The gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For proteomic analyses, polyacrylamide gel extracts of three biological replicates from nanovesicle and cell membrane protein samples were sent for mass spectroscopy. 15 µL of each sample was loaded into the corresponding wells, separating through a homogeneous SDS-PAGE gel (12.5%) at 200 V until the sample ran 1.5 cm into the gel. The gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). LC-MS/MS was conducted on these samples by the Proteomics core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. Using zip tip and trypsin in-gel digestion for each sample, each sample was run during a 2 h gradient on the Orbitrap-Fusion instrument.

### Data Protocol
The LC-MS/MS raw data was analyzed with Scaffold software (version Scaffold_4.8.7; Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Protein identifications were considered positive by recognizing 2 or more peptide hits in at least one of the samples with a peptide threshold of 95% as validated by the Peptide Prophet Algorithm. Blast2Go (version 5.2.5) was used to obtain GO annotations curated from the Scaffold data against the Firmicute database created using Blast2GO with Firmicute data obtained from NCBI. Further analysis on specific proteins identified from the proteomic data included MultAlin, Phobius, TMHMM, and the signal peptide predictor server, SignalP 4.1.
