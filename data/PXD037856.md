### Title
AKTs do not translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation but AKT3 can constitutively signal from the nuclear envelope

### Description
Unlike other signaling proteins, cellular stimulation does not induce nuclear AKT accumulation. While AKT1 is cytoplasmic, shifting to the plasma membrane upon stimulation, AKT2 is mainly nuclear. AKT3 in cancer cells is constitutively active at the nuclear envelope, where it phosphorylates TSC2 and promotes proliferation.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins from nuclear fraction with or without AKT inhibitors were trypsinized and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on Q exactive plus (Thermo). In addition the tryptic peptides were enriched for phosphopeptides using TiOX beads.THe phosphorylated peptides were also analyzed by LC-MS/MS on Q exactive plus (Thermo)

### Data Protocol
The MS data was analyzed by the MaxQuant software with 1% FDR against the human uniprot proteome.
