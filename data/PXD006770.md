### Title
COPD lungs show an attached stratified mucus layer resembling the protective colonic mucus

### Description
Mucus accumulation is a key feature of  respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is associated with goblet cell metaplasia and mucin overexpression, which can be induced by the increased activity of neutrophil elastase. The aim of the study was to characterization of mucus and epithelial cell proteomics in a porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) mouse model of COPD/CF. The major proteins detected in mucus plugs obtained from PPE-treated mice included mucins Muc5ac and Muc5b, mucus-related proteins Clca1, Fcgbp, and Bpifb1. These proteins were upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and epithelial cells in mice exposed to elastase. Similar changes were found in BAL fluid of COPD patients.

### Sample Protocol
Mice BALF (50 μl) and mucus plug samples were incubated overnight at 37°C in reduction buffer (6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl), 0.1 M Tris/ HCl pH 8.5 (Merck), 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M DTT, Merck) followed by a modified filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol using 6 M GuHCl. Briefly, proteins were alkylated on 10 kDa cut-off filters and subsequently digested for 4 h with LysC (Wako Chemicals) followed by an overnight trypsin (Promega) digestion. Heavy peptides (JPT Peptide Technologies) for Muc5b and Muc5ac absolute quantification (5 peptides for each protein, 100 fmol each) were added before trypsin digestion. Epithelial cells for proteomics analysis were prepared according to the FASP protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed by boiling in 4% SDS, buffer was exchanged to 8 M urea on 30 kDa cut-off filters and proteins were alkylated and digested for 4 h with endopeptidase LysC (Wako Chemicals), followed by overnight digestion with trypsin (Promega). Human BALF (180 μl) was processed as mice BALF except heavy labeled peptides (JPT Peptide Technologies) for 15 human proteins were added (100 fmol each; Table S7). Peptides released from the filter by centrifugation were cleaned with StageTip C18 columns as previously described. Nano-Liquid-Chromatography Mass-spectrometry (NanoLC–MS/MS) was performed on an EASY-nLC system (Thermo Scientific), connected to a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) through a nanoelectrospray ion source. Peptides from mucus plugs and BALF samples were separated with in-house packed C18 reverse-phase column (150 × 0.075 mm inner diameter, C18-AQ 3 μm) by 60-minute gradient from 5 to 40% B (A: 0.1% formic acid, B: 0.1% formic acid/80% acetonitrile 200 nl/min). Peptides from epithelial cell samples were separated with heated (50°C) C18 reverse-phase EASY-Spray column (500 × 0.050 mm, PepMap RSLC, 2 μm, 100 Å) by a 120-minute gradient from 2-25% B, followed by 10-minutes increase to 40% B. Full mass spectra were acquired from m/z 320–1,600, for BALF and plugs, or 400–1,600 m/z, for epithelial cell pools, with resolution of 70,000. Up to twelve most intense peaks (charge state ≥ 2) were fragmented and tandem mass spectrum was acquired with a resolution of 35,000 and automatic dynamic exclusion for BALF and mucus plugs samples and with a resolution of 17,500 and dynamic exclusion 10 s for epithelial cells. Human BAL fluid samples were analyzed by acquiring full spectrum from m/z 350–1,600 m/z with resolution of 70,000, up to ten most intense peaks were fragmented and tandem mass spectrum was acquired with a resolution of 17,500 and automatic dynamic exclusion of 10 s. For absolute quantification a separate targeted mass-spectrometry method was used where only precursors and their fragments of the heavy and corresponding light peptides were scanned with a resolution of 35,000.

### Data Protocol
Data was analyzed with the MaxQuant program (version 1.4.1.2), by searching against the mouse UniProt protein database (downloaded July 23, 2015) supplemented with an in-house database containing all the mouse mucin sequences or human Uniprot protein database (downloaded July 23, 2015) supplemented with an in-house database containing all the human mucin sequences (http://www.medkem.gu.se/mucinbiology/databases/). Searches were performed with full tryptic specificity, maximum 2 missed cleavages, precursor tolerance of 20 ppm in the first search used for recalibration, followed by 7 ppm for the main search and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modification. The required false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% both at the peptide and protein levels and the minimum required peptide length was set to six amino acids. Proteins were quantified based on MaxQuant label-free quantification (LFQ) option using minimum two peptides for quantification. Absolute quantification of proteins that had heavy labeled standard peptides was performed with the Skyline program (version 3.6.0.1). Peptides were quantified using isotopically labelled analogues and median peptide concentration was reported as protein concentration.

### Publication Abstract
The respiratory tract is normally kept essentially free of bacteria by cilia-mediated mucus transport, but in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), bacteria and mucus accumulates instead. To address the mechanisms behind the mucus accumulation, the proteome of bronchoalveolar lavages from COPD patients and mucus collected in an elastase-induced mouse model of COPD was analyzed, revealing similarities with each other and with the protein content in colonic mucus. Moreover, stratified laminated sheets of mucus were observed in airways from patients with CF and COPD and in elastase-exposed mice. On the other hand, the mucus accumulation in the elastase model was reduced in Muc5b-KO mice. While mucus plugs were removed from airways by washing with hypertonic saline in the elastase model, mucus remained adherent to epithelial cells. Bacteria were trapped on this mucus, whereas, in non-elastase-treated mice, bacteria were found on the epithelial cells. We propose that the adherence of mucus to epithelial cells observed in CF, COPD, and the elastase-induced mouse model of COPD separates bacteria from the surface cells and, thus, protects the respiratory epithelium.
