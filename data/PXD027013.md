### Title
human NSCLC sh-QKI-6 A549 cell label-free quantification and LC/MS proteomics analysis

### Description
Label-Free Quantitation of Differentially Expressed Proteins in Sh-QKI6 and sh-NC

### Sample Protocol
Sh-NC and sh-QKI-6 cells were cultured in 100 mm dishes. All the sample cells were treated using a Mhelix Biotech kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Shanghai, China). Label-free quantification and LC/MS proteomics analysis were performed by the Mhelix Biotech Company (Shanghai, China).

### Data Protocol
label-free proteomics technology was used to detect changes in protein expression levels in sh-QKI-6 and sh-NC cells. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using the Proteme Discoverer 1.4 between the sh-QKI-6 and sh-NC cells. The label-free quantitation analysis of proteins from sh-QKI-6 and sh-NC was performed using Progenesis LC-MS software. All the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO, www.geneontology.org) database, which provided networks of Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC) to describe the gene product attributes.

### Publication Abstract
The RNA-binding protein quaking homolog 6 (QKI-6) is a tumor-suppressor gene in several cancers. However, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between QKI-6 expression and survival and clinicopathological features in patients with NSCLC and identify the related mechanisms. Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect QKI-6 expression in NSCLC. The effect of QKI-6 on NSCLC cells was determined by overexpression and knockdown assays, and label-free quantitative proteomics and Western blot were used to identify the underlying mechanisms. Low QKI-6 expression level was positively correlated with poor overall survival in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, QKI-6 overexpression inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and migration and induced a block in the G0/G1 phase, and QKI-6 downregulation increased proliferation and migration. QKI-6 inhibited EMT processes <i>via</i> EGFR/SRC/STAT3 signaling by upregulating AGR2. In conclusion, QKI-6 could be used to develop novel strategies for the treatment of NSCLC.
