### Title
EE1A1 Interactome

### Description
Analysis of eEF1A1 interacting proteins upon upon sciatic nerve crush lesion in mice.

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitation of eEF1A1 compared to GFP. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, proteins in gel digested and analyzed by label-free LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The MS raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant Software version 1.4.1.236 for peak detection, quantification and peptide identification using a full length UniProt mouse database (April, 2016) and common contaminants such as keratins and enzymes used for in-gel digestion as reference.
