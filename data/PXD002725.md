### Title
Data independent MS phenotyping of patient derived melanoma cell lines

### Description
Phenotyping of patient derived Stage III and IV melanoma cell lines to predict drug response

### Sample Protocol
Cell lines were lysed, reduced (DTT), alkylated (IAA), digested with trypsin and profiled by LC-SWATH using an in-house spectral library generated by Multiphase LC-MS/MS (Krisp et al. MCP 2015) for online SCX-RP LC-MS/MS of all cell lines used in this study.

### Data Protocol
ProteinPilot 5.0 search results (.group) were imported into PeakView 2.1 with SWATH 2.0. Only non-shared and unmodified peptides (confidence >= 99%) were extracted and protein areas used for cell line assessment. Perseus 2.5 was used for further data analysis.
