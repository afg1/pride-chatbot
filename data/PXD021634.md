### Title
proteomics of PITHD1-deficient mice

### Description
To examine the functionality of PITHD1 on the olfactory molecular homeostasis in vivo, we applied olfactory proteomics in 6-week and 3-month-old PITHD1-/- mice. To analyze the potential differences in olfactory molecular expression profiles, OB specimens for each experimental group (PITHD1-/- and WT mice) were subjected to SWATH-MS.

### Sample Protocol
SWATH-MS proteomics applied to OB derived from PITHD1-/- mice. MS/MS library generation. Wild-type and PITHD1-/- OB specimens were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 50 mM DTT (6-weeks and 12-weeks-old, n=3 per group). The homogenates were spinned down at 100.000 × g for 1 h at 15 °C. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay kit (Bio-rad). As an input for generating the SWATH-MS assay library, a pool of 12 samples (2.5µg/sample) derived from 6-weeks-old mice (n=3/group)  and 12-weeks-old mice (n=3/group) was used. Protein extracts (30 µg) was diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 0.75 mm thick polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. Total gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 12 equals slides from the pooled sample was excised from the gel and transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Protein enzymatic cleavage was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko, A. et al. Nat Protoc 1(6), 2856 (2006)). Peptide mixture was dried in a speed vacuum for 20 min. Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). Peptides recovered from in-gel digestion processing were reconstituted into a final concentration of 0.5µg/µL of 2% ACN, 0.5% FA, 97.5% MilliQ-water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. MS/MS datasets for spectral library generation were acquired on a Triple TOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (Sciex, Canada) interfaced to an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump system (SCIEX, Canada) fitted with a 75 μm ID column (Thermo Scientific 0.075 × 250mm, particle size 3 μm and pore size 100 Å). Prior to separation, the peptides were concentrated on a C18 precolumn (Thermo Scientific 0.1 × 50mm, particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 Å). Mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a gradient from 2% B to 40% B in 120 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 10 min and 2% B for 10 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Output of the separation column was directly coupled to nano-electrospray source. MS1 spectra was collected in the range of 350-1250 m/z for 250 ms. The 35 most intense precursors with charge states of 2 to 5 that exceeded 150 counts per second were selected for fragmentation, rolling collision energy was used for fragmentation and MS2 spectra were collected in the range of 230–1500 m/z for 100 ms. The precursor ions were dynamically excluded from reselection for 15 s. MS/MS data acquisition was performed using AnalystTF 1.7 (Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through ProteinPilot v5.0 search engine (Sciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) (Shilov IV, Seymour SL et al Mol Cell Proteomics 2007) for database search. To avoid using the same spectral evidence in more than one protein, the identified proteins were grouped based on MS/MS spectra by the Progroup™ algorithm, regardless of the peptide sequence assigned. The protein within each group that could explain more spectral data with confidence was depicted as the primary protein of the group. False discovery rate was performed using a non-lineal fitting method (Tang WH, Shilov IV, Seymour SL JPR 2008) and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global false discovery rate or better.

### Data Protocol
SWATH-MS proteomics of OB derived from PITHD1-/- mice. Quantitative analysis. Protein extracts (20 µg) from each sample were reduced by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10mM and incubation at 25ºC for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation by 30 mM iodoacetamide was performed for 1h in the dark. An additional reduction step was performed by 30mM DTT, allowing the reaction to stand at 25ºC for 1h. The mixture was diluted to 0.6M urea using MilliQ-water, and after trypsin addition (Promega) (enzyme:protein, 1:50 w/w), the sample was incubated at 37ºC for 16h. Digestion was quenched by acidification with acetic acid. The digestion mixture was dried in a SpeedVac. Purification and concentration of peptides was performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). The peptides recovered were reconstituted into a final concentration of 0.5µg/µL of 2% ACN, 0.5% FA, 97.5% MilliQ-water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. For SWATH-MS-based experiments the instrument (Sciex TripleTOF 5600+) was configured as described by Gillet et al (Gillet LC, Mol. Cell. Proteomics 11 (6) 2012). Briefly, the mass spectrometer was operated in a looped product ion mode. In this mode, the instrument was specifically tuned to allow a quadrupole resolution of Da/mass selection. The stability of the mass selection was maintained by the operation of the Radio Frequency (RF) and Direct Current (DC) voltages on the isolation quadrupole in an independent manner. Using an isolation width of 16 Da (15 Da of optimal ion transmission efficiency and 1 Da for the window overlap), a set of 37 overlapping windows were constructed covering the mass range 450–1000 Da. In this way, 1 μL of each sample was loaded onto a trap column (Thermo Scientific 0.1 × 50mm, particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 Å) and desalted with 0.1% TFA at 3 μL/min during 10 min. The peptides were loaded onto an analytical column (Thermo Scientific 0.075 × 250mm, particle size 3 μm and pore size 100 Å) equilibrated in 2% acetonitrile 0.1% FA. Peptide elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 2 to 40% B in 120 min (mobile phases A:100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) and B: 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Eluted peptides were infused in the mass spectrometer. The Triple-TOF was operated in swath mode, in which a 0.050 s TOF MS scan from 350 to 1250 m/z was performed, followed by 0.080 s product ion scans from 230 to 1800 m/z on the 37 defined windows (3.05 s/cycle). Collision energy was set to optimum energy for a 2 + ion at the center of each SWATH block with a 15 eV collision energy spread. The mass spectrometer was always operated in high sensitivity mode. The resulting ProteinPilot group file from library generation was loaded into PeakView® (v2.1, Sciex) and peaks from SWATH runs were extracted with a peptide confidence threshold of 99% confidence (Unused Score ≥ 1.3) and a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1%. For this, the MS/MS spectra of the assigned peptides was extracted by ProteinPilot, and only the proteins that fulfilled the following criteria were validated: (1) peptide mass tolerance lower than 10 ppm, (2) 99% of confidence level in peptide identification, and (3) complete b/y ions series found in the MS/MS spectrum.  Only proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides were considered. The quantitative data obtained by PeakView® were analyzed using Perseus software (Tyanova S et al. Nat. Methods 2016, 13, 731–740) for statistical analysis and data visualization.

### Publication Abstract
The Human Proteome Project (HPP) consortium aims to functionally characterize the dark proteome. On the basis of the relevance of olfaction in early neurodegeneration, we have analyzed the dark proteome using data mining in public resources and omics data sets derived from the human olfactory system. Multiple dark proteins localize at synaptic terminals and may be involved in amyloidopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have characterized the dark PITH domain-containing protein 1 (PITHD1) in olfactory metabolism using bioinformatics, proteomics, in vitro and in vivo studies, and neuropathology. PITHD1<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit olfactory bulb (OB) proteome changes related to synaptic transmission, cognition, and memory. OB PITHD1 expression increases with age in wild-type (WT) mice and decreases in Tg2576 AD mice at late stages. The analysis across 6 neurological disorders reveals that olfactory tract (OT) PITHD1 is specifically upregulated in human AD. Stimulation of olfactory neuroepithelial (ON) cells with PITHD1 alters the ON phosphoproteome, modifies the proliferation rate, and induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This workflow applied by the Spanish C-HPP and Human Brain Proteome Project (HBPP) teams across the ON-OB-OT axis can be adapted as a guidance to decipher functional features of dark proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD018784 and PXD021634.
