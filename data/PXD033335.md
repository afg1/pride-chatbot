### Title
Integrated Multiomics analysis to infer covid 19 biological insights

### Description
analysis of 57 sever covid patients's plasma samples for untargeted shotgun proteomics and metabolomics

### Sample Protocol
plasma samples were subjected to protein extraction, insolution trypsinized, peptides were purified and analyzed into MS

### Data Protocol
Samples were searched against human database using peptide shaker. NSAF metrics were extracted for subsequent statistical analysis

### Publication Abstract
Early diagnosis is one of the most important factors in determining the prognosis in cancer. Sensitive detection and quantification of tumour-specific biomarkers have the potential to improve significantly our diagnostic capability. Here, we introduce a triggerable aptamer-based nanostructure based on an oligonucleotide/gold nanoparticle architecture that selectively disassembles in the presence of the biomarker of interest; its optimization is based also on in-silico determination of the aptamer nucleotides interactions with the protein of interest. We demonstrate this scheme for the case of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and PSMA derived from PSMA-positive exosomes. We tested the disassembly of the system by diameter and count rate measurements in dynamic light scattering, and by inspection of its plasmon resonance shift, upon addition of PSMA, finding appreciable differences down to the sub-picomolar range; this points towards the possibility that this approach may lead to sensors competitive with diagnostic biochemical assays that require enzymatic amplification. More generally, this scheme has the potential to be applied to a broad range of pathologies with specific identified biomarkers.
