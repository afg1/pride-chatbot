### Title
Widespread Involvement of Acetylation in the Retinal Metabolism of Form-Deprivation Myopia in Guinea Pigs

### Description
Myopia has become the major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Although the pathogenesis of myopia remains controversial, proteomics studies suggest that dysregulation of retinal metabolism is potentially involved in the pathology of myopia. Lysine acetylation of proteins plays a key role in regulating cellular metabolism, but little is known about its role in the form-deprived myopic retina. In this study, we performed acetylation proteomic analysis of the retinas of form-deprived myopic guinea pigs and found downregulated levels of acetylation of metabolism-critical enzymes in the retina. As the first report on retinal acetylation in myopic eyes, this study provides a reliable basis for further studies on retinal acetylation in myopic eyes

### Sample Protocol
After 2 weeks of form deprivation, guinea pigs were executed with an overdose of barbiturates. Six retinas from each group were taken for subsequent protein extraction, trypsin digestion, modified peptide enrichment, LC-MS/MS assay, and bioinformatics analysis.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using the MaxQuant search engine (v.1.6.15.0). Search the UniProt database for tandem mass spectra of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). A series of bioinformatics analyses, such as GO functional annotation, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction network, and Motif analysis, were then performed.

### Publication Abstract
Myopia has become the major cause of visual impairment worldwide. Although the pathogenesis of myopia remains controversial, proteomic studies suggest that dysregulation of retinal metabolism is potentially involved in the pathology of myopia. Lysine acetylation of proteins plays a key role in regulating cellular metabolism, but little is known about its role in the form-deprived myopic retina. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of proteomic and acetylomic changes in the retinas of guinea pigs with form-deprivation myopia was performed. In total, 85 significantly differential proteins and 314 significantly differentially acetylated proteins were identified. Notably, the differentially acetylated proteins were markedly enriched in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, retinol metabolism, and the HIF-1 signaling pathway. HK2, HKDC1, PKM, LDH, GAPDH, and ENO1 were the key enzymes in these metabolic pathways with decreased acetylation levels in the form-deprivation myopia group. Altered lysine acetylation of key enzymes in the form-deprived myopic retina might affect the dynamic balance of metabolism in the retinal microenvironment by altering their activity. In conclusion, as the first report on the myopic retinal acetylome, this study provides a reliable basis for further studies on myopic retinal acetylation.
