### Title
Serum PTM Identification_Technical Triplicates

### Description
A technical triplicate experiment was performed to validate the robustness of the method using pooled serum of non-small cell lung cancer patients

### Sample Protocol
Pooled serum samples were difested by trypsin and peptides were subject to sequencial enrichment using lysine acetylation and arginine mono-methylation antibodies followed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Raw data was searched by Sequest and identified peptides were quantified by label-free quantification

### Publication Abstract
A robust method was developed and optimized for enrichment and quantitative analysis of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in serum/plasma samples by combining immunoaffinity purification and LC-MS/MS without depletion of abundant proteins. The method was used to survey serum samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer (BC), and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Peptides were identified from serum samples containing phosphorylation, acetylation, lysine methylation, and arginine methylation. Of the PTMs identified, lysine acetylation (AcK) and arginine mono-methylation (Rme) were more prevalent than other PTMs. Label-free quantitative analysis of AcK and Rme peptides was performed for sera from AML, BC, and NSCLC patients. Several AcK and Rme sites showed distinct abundance distribution patterns across the three cancer types. The identification and quantification of posttranslationally modified peptides in serum samples reported here can be used for patient profiling and biomarker discovery research.
