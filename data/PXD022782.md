### Title
Mast cell-derived SAMD14 is a novel regulator of the human prostate tumor microenvironment

### Description
Mast cells (MCs) are important cellular components of the tumor microenvironment and are significantly associated with poor patient outcomes in prostate cancer and other solid cancers. The promotion of tumor progression partly involves heterotypic interactions between MCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which combine to potentiate a pro-tumor extracellular matrix and promote epithelial cell invasion and migration. Thus far, the interactions between MCs and CAFs remains poorly understood. To identify molecular changes that may alter resident MC function in the prostate tumor microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptome of human prostate MCs, isolated from patient-matched non-tumor and tumor-associated regions of fresh radical prostatectomy tissue. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct gene expression profile of MCs isolated from prostate tumor regions, including the downregulation of SAMD14, a putative tumor suppressor gene.  Proteomic profiling revealed overexpression of SAMD14 in HMC-1 MCs altered the secretion of proteins associated with immune regulation and extracellular matrix processes. To assess MC biological function within a model of the prostate tumor microenvironment, HMC-1-SAMD14+ conditioned media was added to co-cultures of primary prostatic CAFs and prostate epithelium. HMC-1-SAMD14+ secretions were shown to reduce the deposition and alignment of matrix produced by CAFs and suppress pro-tumorigenic prostate epithelial morphology. Overall, our data presents the first profile of human MCs derived from patient prostate cancer specimens and identifies MC-derived SAMD14 as an important mediator of MC phenotype and function within the prostate tumor microenvironment.

### Sample Protocol
HMC-1 and HMC-1 SAMD14+ cells were seeded at 3 X 105 cells/ml and cultured in Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's medium (IMDM; Gibco) without serum for 48h. Each experiment was repeated 3 times. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant from this culture was then collected and filtered with a 0.22 μm pore-sized filter. Equal amount of conditioned media (5 mL) was concentrated and buffer exchanged with Amicon Ultra 4 centrifugal Filter Units (Merck). The protein concentration was determined with Bicinchoninic Acid assay (BCA, ThermoFisher Scientific). The protein was reduced, alkylated and trypsin-digested overnight. The digested peptides were cleaned up with SDB-RPS StageTips (3M).

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were analyzed with the MaxQuant software suite v1.6.5.0 and its implemented Andromeda search engine to obtain protein identifications and their respective label-free quantification (LFQ) values using standard parameters. The proteomics data were further analyzed using LFQ-Analyst.

### Publication Abstract
Mast cells (MCs) are important cellular components of the tumor microenvironment and are significantly associated with poor patient outcomes in prostate cancer and other solid cancers. The promotion of tumor progression partly involves heterotypic interactions between MCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which combine to potentiate a pro-tumor extracellular matrix and promote epithelial cell invasion and migration. Thus far, the interactions between MCs and CAFs remain poorly understood. To identify molecular changes that may alter resident MC function in the prostate tumor microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptome of human prostate MCs isolated from patient-matched non-tumor and tumor-associated regions of fresh radical prostatectomy tissue. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct gene expression profile of MCs isolated from prostate tumor regions, including the downregulation of <i>SAMD14</i>, a putative tumor suppressor gene. Proteomic profiling revealed that overexpression of SAMD14 in HMC-1 altered the secretion of proteins associated with immune regulation and extracellular matrix processes. To assess MC biological function within a model of the prostate tumor microenvironment, HMC-1-SAMD14+ conditioned media was added to co-cultures of primary prostatic CAFs and prostate epithelium. HMC-1-SAMD14+ secretions were shown to reduce the deposition and alignment of matrix produced by CAFs and suppress pro-tumorigenic prostate epithelial morphology. Overall, our data present the first profile of human MCs derived from prostate cancer patient specimens and identifies MC-derived SAMD14 as an important mediator of MC phenotype and function within the prostate tumor microenvironment.
