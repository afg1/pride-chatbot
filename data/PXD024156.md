### Title
Influence of the Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulator Riociguat on Myocardial Left Ventricular Proteome and microRNA expression after Experimental Aortic Stenosis in Mice

### Description
We analyzed global proteomic adaptations during heart failure (HF) progression in a mouse model, suffering from left ventricular pressure overload due to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and in response to riociguat (RIO) treatment, to gain deeper insights in beneficial effects due to sGC stimulation on cardiac remodeling and HF.  TAC and sham animals were treated with either riociguat (RIO; 3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (VEH; Transcutol®/Cremophor®/water: 10%/20%/70%) for five weeks, starting three weeks post-op when cardiac hypertrophy was established, resulting in four treatment groups ( n=5-6 per group).  At the end of the study, hearts were dissected and proteomes of the left ventricles (LV) were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS).

### Sample Protocol
- protein extraction via bead mill and ultra-sonication from LV of the four treatment groups (TAC/RIO, TAC/VEH, Sham/RIO, Sham/VEH) - tryptic digestion (LysC and Trypsin)  - desalting of digests with ZipTip µ-C18 - data dependent LC-ESI-MS/MS measurement on nano-UPLC/LTQ Orbitrap Velos

### Data Protocol
- data processing via MaxQuant software package (v1.5.3.8) - identification via Andromeda peptide search engine within MaxQuant
