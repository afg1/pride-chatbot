### Title
Total synthesis of rosette inhibitor IOR allows its functional analysis and evaluation of sulfonolipid-based chemical probes

### Description
The predatory choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta has emerged as important model systems to study the evolution of multicellularity and chemical origin of bacterial-eukaryote communication mechanisms. In this study we elaborated on the function and possible proteogenic binding partners of the bacterial sulfonolipid IOR-1A, which serves as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S. rosetta. To study the function of IOR-1A, a new, modular and scalable total synthesis of IOR-1A (six steps, 30% overall yield) was developed, which features a decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivative carrying a protected sulfonic acid moiety with an alkyl zink reagents of choice. Synthesis of twelve IOR derivates, including fluorescent and photoaffinity-based probes, allowed to determine the abundance of IOR-1A, evaluation of structure-activity relations, localization studies within S. rosetta and de novo chemical proteomic identification of IOR-binding proteins in bacteria and S. rosetta. The combined results will catalyse future studies aiming at deciphering the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within rosette formation of S. rosetta.

### Sample Protocol
Live cells and cell lysates of Salpingoeca rosetta and Algoriphagus machipongonensis PR1 or Echinicola pacifica KMM 6172 were treated with IOR-photoaffinity probes (7.5 Î¼M, dark, 22 Â°C, 1 h) and UV irradiation (350 nm, 30 min). S. rosetta was incubated in 1200 mL 4% SWC medium at 22 Â°C for 3 days. 1Ã—10^7 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM KCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 250 mM Sucrose; 1 mM DTT; 10 mM Digitonin; 1 mg/ml Sodium Heparin; 1 mM Pefabloc SC; 0.5 U/Î¼l DNaseI; 1 U/Î¼l SUPERaseIN) incubated for 15 min on ice and passed five times through a 30G needle. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 21,000Ã—g for 25 min, and the supernatant was diluted with PBS to reach 4 mg/mL final protein concentration. For click chemistry reaction, 858 Î¼L cell lysates, 110 Î¼L 10 % SDS solution, 22 Î¼L alkyne-Biotin-TAMRA and a freshly prepared 110 Î¼L Copper mixture (33 Î¼L 1.7 mM TBTA in 80% t-butanol/20% DMSO, 11 Î¼L 50 mM CuSO4, 11Î¼L 50 mM TCEP) was added and incubated at 32 Â°C for 30 min. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were digested in-gel according to the modified protocol of Shevchenko et al. 2006 (doi:10.1038/nprot.2006.468). For gel-free analysis proteins were desalted with 7K MWCO Thermo Zeba Spin desalting columns and  TCA-precipitation. Precipitates were solubilized with 100 Î¼L 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Protein concentrations were measured by DirectDetect (Merck) and all samples were diluted with 100 mM TEAB to a concentration of 3 Î¼g/Î¼L. Each 400 Î¼L samples were mixed with 8 Î¼L of 500 mM TCEP and 8 Î¼L of 625 mM 2-chloroacetamide and incubated in the dark (600 rpm, 70 Â°C, 30 min). Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic Beads were washed with and resuspended (1 mL) in PBS. 160 Î¼L beads were incubated in the dark (950 rpm, 4 Â°C, 18 h) with the protein sample for the enrichment of the cross-linked proteins. The supernatant was removed and beads were collected with magnetic forces. Beads were washed each 3 times with 0.5 % SDS, PBS, and H2O, re-suspended with 250Â Î¼L 100 mM TEAB (+5% trifluroroethanol), and digested with 6 Î¼g Trypsin/Lys-C Mix (Promega) at 37 Â°C for 18 h. Tryptic peptides were dried and dissolved in 30 Î¼L of 2 % ACN and 0.05 % TFA in H2O with addition of 0.6 Î¼L of 1 pmol MassPREP Bovine Hemoglobin internal standard (Waters). Tryptic peptides were filtrated (10 kDa MWCO, PES membrane, VWR) at 14,000Ã—g for 15 min and finally transferred into a HPLC vials. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system connected to a QExactive Plus (#1) or a QExactive HF (#2) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptide trapping for 5 min on an Acclaim PM 100 column (2 cm Ã— 75 Âµm, 3 Âµm) at 5 Âµl/min was followed by separation on an analytical Acclaim PM RSLC nano column (50 cm Ã— 75 Âµm, 2 Âµm). Mobile phase gradient elution of eluent A (0.1% HCOOH in H2O) mixed with eluent B (0.1% HCOOH in 90/10 ACN/H2O) was performed using the following gradient: LC-MS/MS #1: 0 min at 4% B, 30 min at 12% B, 75 min at 30% B, 85 min at 50% B, 90â€“95 min at 96% B, 95.1â€“120 min at 4% B. LC-MS/MS #2: 0 min at 4% B, 5 min at 8% B, 30 min at 12% B, 75 min at 30% B, 85 min at 50% B, 90â€“95 min at 96% B, 95.1â€“120 min at 4% B. Positively charged ions were generated at 2.2 kV with a stainless-steel emitter in the Nanospray Flex Ion Source. The MS instruments were operated in DDA MS2 Top10 (#1) and Top15 (#2) mode. Precursor ions were monitored at m/z 300â€“1500 at R 70,000 (#1) and 120,000 (#2) FWHM using a ITmax of 120 ms and an AGC target of 1Ã—10^6 (#1) and 3Ã—10^6 (#2). Precursor ions with a charge state of z=2â€“5 were isolated at a width of m/z 1.6 amu for HCD fragmentation at 30% (#1) and 28% (#2) NCE. MS2 ions were scanned at 17,500 FWHM (#1) and 15,000 FWHM (#2) at ITmax of 120 ms (#1) and 100 ms (#2) with an AGC target of 2Ã—10^5. Dynamic exclusion of precursor ions was set to 30 s (#1) and 25s (#2).

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched against the NCBI databases of S. rosetta, A. machipongonensis and/or E. pacifica (2021/08/09; YYYY/MM/DD)using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 (Thermo) and the algorithms of Mascot 2.4.1 (Matrix Science, UK), Sequest HT (version of PD2.4), MS Amanda 2.0, and MS Fragger 3.2. Two missed cleavages were allowed for the tryptic digestion. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Modifications were defined as dynamic Met oxidation, protein N-term Met-loss and/or acetylation as well as static Cys carbamidomethylation. A strict false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% (peptide and protein level) and a search engine score of > 30 (Mascot), > 4 (Sequest HT), > 300 (MS Amanda) or > 8 (MS Fragger) was required for positive protein hits. The Percolator node of PD2.4 and a reverse decoy database was used for q value validation of spectral matches. Only rank 1 proteins and peptides of the top scored proteins were counted. Label-free protein quantification was based on the Minora algorithm of PD2.4 using the precursor abundance based on intensity and a signal-to-noise ratio > 5. Normalization was performed against the Hemoglobin internal standard. Imputation of missing quan values was applied by using abundance values of 75% of the lowest abundance identified per sample. Differential protein abundance was defined as a fold change of > 4, ratio-adjusted p-value < 0.05 (p-value/log4ratio) and at least identified in 2 of 3 replicates of the sample group with the highest abundance.

### Publication Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR-1A (six steps, 27&#x2009;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#x2005;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid-containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR-1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity-based probes, allowed quantification of IOR-1A, localization studies within S.&#x2005;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure-activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#x2005;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#x2005;rosetta.
