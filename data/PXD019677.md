### Title
Global profiling of myristoylation in Toxoplasma gondii

### Description
N-myristoylation is a ubiquitous class of protein lipidation across eukaryotes and N-myristoyl transferase (NMT) has been proposed as an attractive drug target in several pathogens. Here we describe the first global chemoproteomic analysis of protein myristoylation in Toxoplasma gondii. Through quantitative mass spectrometry coupled with validated chemoproteomic tools (cleavable capture reagents (Broncel et al., 2015, Speers and Cravatt, 2005) and NMT inhibitor (Schlott et al., 2019)) that allow for experimental validation, we confidently identified 65 myristoylated proteins. This dataset represents a large fraction of the parasite’s myristoylated proteome and a prerequisite to investigate this modification in Toxoplasma.

### Sample Protocol
The data presented are from three label-free quantification (LFQ) experiments (see Sample legend). Parasites were cultured in Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) monolayers in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO2. Upon infection of HFF monolayers the medium was removed and replaced by fresh culture media supplemented with 25 µM YnMyr or Myr. After 16 h intracellular parasites were lysed (PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor) and protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Each experiment comprised of replicates treated with YnMyr and the same number of replicates treated with Myr control. Lysates (2 mg/mL) were subjected to a click reaction with a biotinylated capture reagent (1, 2 or 3). For samples treated with base, NaOH was added (final concentration 0.2 M, 1 h) followed by neutralization with equivalent amount of HCl. Base treated and untreated samples were then diluted (1 mg/mL, 0.4% SDS, 1 mM DTT) before pull down on NeutrAvidin agarose resin (2 h, room temperature). The samples were reduced (5 mM DTT, 56°C, 30 min) and cysteines alkylated (10 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature, 30 min) followed by on-bead digestion. For samples processed with reagent 1 and 2 as well as for supernatants (proteomes) MS grade trypsin (Promega) was used at 1:1000 w/w protease:protein, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. For reagent 3 two digestion strategies were used. TEV I: TEV protease (50 units, Invitrogen) was added and samples were incubated overnight at 30°C. Supernatant was then removed and a fresh portion of TEV protease (20 units) was added (6 h at 30°C). MS grade Trypsin was subsequently added at 1:1000 w/w protease:protein, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. TEV II: samples were incubated overnight at 37°C with MS grade Trypsin at 1:1000 w/w protease:protein. The supernatant was removed (fraction 1) and TEV protease was added (50 units) and beads incubated overnight at 30°C (fraction 2).  For chemical inhibition of TgNMT, HFFs were infected with Toxoplasma and cultured for 16 h. The media was then replaced and intracellular parasites co-treated with 25 µM YnMyr and the indicated concentrations of IMP-1002 for 5 h. Following PBS wash (2x) the cells were lysed on ice using the lysis buffer and samples were further processed exactly as described above. Proteins were digested with MS grade trypsin (Promega) at 1:1000 w/w protease:protein, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Following digestion samples were stage-tip purified and resuspended in 0.1% TFA for LC-MS/MS analysis using a U3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific) interfaced with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos or Q Exactive (both Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. Each sample was pre-concentrated on an Acclaim PepMap 100 trapping column before separation on a 50 cm, 75μm I.D. EASY-Spray PepMap column. The instrument was run in data dependent acquisition mode with most abundant peptides selected for MS/MS fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Acquired raw files were processed with MaxQuant (versions 1.5.0.25 and 1.5.2.8) and peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra searched against Toxoplasma gondii (combined TG1, ME49 and VEG proteomes, ToxoDB) and Homo sapiens (UniProt) proteomes using Andromeda search engine. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification and Acetyl (Protein N-term), Oxidation (M), Deamidation (NQ) were selected as variable modifications. The enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search (used for mass re-calibration) and to 4.5 ppm for the main search. The datasets were filtered on posterior error probability (PEP) to achieve a 1% false discovery rate on protein, peptide and site level. Other parameters were used as pre-set in the software. “Unique and razor peptides” mode was selected to allow identification and quantification of proteins in groups (razor peptides are uniquely assigned to protein groups and not to individual proteins). LFQ in MaxQuant was performed using a built-in label-free quantification algorithm enabling the ‘Match between runs’ option (time window 0.7 minutes) within replicates. Myristoylated peptide search in MaxQuant was performed as described above applying the following variable modifications: cysteine carbamidomethylation, +463.2907 (reagent 2) and +491.3220 (reagent 3) at any peptide N-terminus and cysteine residues. In addition, the minimum peptide length was reduced to 6 amino acids and the ‘Match between runs’ option was disabled. In order to reduce a possibility for a false peptide sequence assignment, we applied relatively high delta score thresholds (20 vs 6 pre-set as default) for all myristoylated peptides in our analysis.

### Publication Abstract
<i>N</i>-myristoylation is a ubiquitous class of protein lipidation across eukaryotes and <i>N</i>-myristoyl transferase (NMT) has been proposed as an attractive drug target in several pathogens. Myristoylation often primes for subsequent palmitoylation and stable membrane attachment, however, growing evidence suggests additional regulatory roles for myristoylation on proteins. Here we describe the myristoylated proteome of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> using chemoproteomic methods and show that a small-molecule NMT inhibitor developed against related <i>Plasmodium spp</i>. is also functional in <i>Toxoplasma</i>. We identify myristoylation on a transmembrane protein, the microneme protein 7 (MIC7), which enters the secretory pathway in an unconventional fashion with the myristoylated N-terminus facing the lumen of the micronemes. MIC7 and its myristoylation play a crucial role in the initial steps of invasion, likely during the interaction with and penetration of the host cell. Myristoylation of secreted eukaryotic proteins represents a substantial expansion of the functional repertoire of this co-translational modification.
