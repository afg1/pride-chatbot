### Title
Quantitative interaction proteomics of neurodegenerative disease proteins

### Description
Several proteins have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), but their molecular function is not completely understood. Here, we used quantitative interaction proteomics to identify binding partners of Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), Huntingtin (HTT) for Huntingtonâ€™s disease, Parkin-2 (PARK-2) for Parkinsonâ€™s disease and Ataxin-1 (ATXN-1) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Our network reveals common signatures of protein degradation and misfolding and recapitulates known biology. Toxicity modifier screens and comparison to genome-wide association studies show that interaction partners are significantly linked to disease phenotypes in vivo. Direct comparison of wild-type proteins and disease-associated variants identified binders involved in pathogenesis, highlighting the value of differential interactome mapping. Finally, we show that the mitochondrial protein LRPPRC interacts preferentially with an early onset AD variant of APP. This interaction appears to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which is an early phenotype of AD.

### Sample Protocol
Immunoprecipitations of myc-tagged bait proteins were performed using the Î¼MACS c-myc isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 100 mM glycine pH 2.5 and ethanol-precipitated overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitated proteins were processed essentially as described (Paul et al., 2011). Co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins were performed by crosslinking specific anti-bait antibodies to NHS-activated Sepharose as described (Paul et al., 2011).

### Data Protocol
Pull-down samples were measured on LTQ-Orbitrap or LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometers, whole proteome experiments on LTQ-Orbitrap Velos machines. Raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed using the MaxQuant software environment (Cox and Mann, 2008). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.

### Publication Abstract
Several proteins have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), but their molecular function is not completely understood. Here, we used quantitative interaction proteomics to identify binding partners of Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntingtin (HTT) for Huntington's disease, Parkin (PARK2) for Parkinson's disease, and Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Our network reveals common signatures of protein degradation and misfolding and recapitulates known biology. Toxicity modifier screens and comparison to genome-wide association studies show that interaction partners are significantly linked to disease phenotypes in vivo. Direct comparison of wild-type proteins and disease-associated variants identified binders involved in pathogenesis, highlighting the value of differential interactome mapping. Finally, we show that the mitochondrial protein LRPPRC interacts preferentially with an early-onset AD variant of APP. This interaction appears to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which is an early phenotype of AD.
