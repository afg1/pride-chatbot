### Title
TBK1-mediated phosphorylation sites of ATG8s in vitro

### Description
Identification of LC3 family proteins phoshorylation sites mediated by TBK1

### Sample Protocol
In vitro phosphorylated LC3 family proteins were used to determine TBK1-dependent phosphorylation sites. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, reduced and alkylated and digested in-gel with trypsin. Peptides were desalted on reversed phase C18 StageTips and analyzed on an Orbitrap EliteTM mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher).

### Data Protocol
The raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant 1.6.5.0 and Perseus softwares. The database used to identify the peptides was human from uniport, with FDR 1% on protein, 5% PSM and 5% site decoy level.
