### Title
Cross talks between mutant Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 in the peripheral immune system and the CNS regulate neurodegeneration after environmental insult - part 1

### Description
Missense mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene result in late-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The incomplete penetrance of LRRK2 mutations in humans and LRRK2 murine models of PD suggests that the disease may result from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and persistent exogenous insults. To achieve a detailed characterization of the altered neuroinflammatory reaction in the brain of mutant LRRK2 mice, we performed mass spectrometry analysis (tandem mass tagging, TMT) of brain tissue obtained from intact and acute LPS-challenged WT and R1441G mutant mice.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from mouse samples and digested in two steps with LysC (Wako) and trypsin (Promega). The peptides were then desalted, labeled with TMT reagents (Thermo Fisher) and pooled equally. The pool was desalted again and fractionated by two dimensional reversed-phase liquid chromatography, followed by high resolution tandem MS analysis (Orbitrap fusion from Thermo Fisher).

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS raw files are processed using the JUMP searching engine against UniProt mouse database. Searches were performed using 6 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions due to JUMP’s auto mass correction function and 15ppm for fragment ions, allowing up to two missed trypsin cleavage sites. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (+229.162932 Da) and dynamic modifications include oxidation of methionine residues (+15.99492 Da). The assigned peptides are filtered by minimal peptide length, maximum miscleavages, mass-to-charge accuracy and matching scores. The peptides are then divided into groups according to peptide length, trypticity, modification, miscleavage, and charge and then further filtered by matching scores to reduce protein or phosphopeptide FDR to below 1%. Proteins were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matched PSMs using our in-house software.

### Publication Abstract
Missense mutations in the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene result in late-onset Parkinson's disease. The incomplete penetrance of LRRK2 mutations in humans and LRRK2 murine models of Parkinson's disease suggests that the disease may result from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and persistent exogenous insults. Since neuroinflammation is commonly associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, we examine a potential role of mutant LRRK2 in regulation of the immune response and inflammatory signalling in vivo. Here, we show that mice overexpressing human pathogenic LRRK2 mutations, but not wild-type mice or mice overexpressing human wild-type LRRK2 exhibit long-term lipopolysaccharide-induced nigral neuronal loss. This neurodegeneration is accompanied by an exacerbated neuroinflammation in the brain. The increased immune response in the brain of mutant mice subsequently has an effect on neurons by inducing intraneuronal LRRK2 upregulation. However, the enhanced neuroinflammation is unlikely to be triggered by dysfunctional microglia or infiltrated T cells and/or monocytes, but by peripheral circulating inflammatory molecules. Analysis of cytokine kinetics and inflammatory pathways in the peripheral immune cells demonstrates that LRRK2 mutation alters type II interferon immune response, suggesting that this increased neuroinflammatory response may arise outside the central nervous system. Overall, this study suggests that peripheral immune signalling plays an unexpected-but important-role in the regulation of neurodegeneration in LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease, and provides new targets for interfering with the onset and progression of the disease.
