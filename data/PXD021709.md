### Title
BioID of PAX8 in human ovarian cancer cells

### Description
Investigation of interactors for the human transcription factor PAX8 using BioID-based proximity labeling, as described in Galli et al.

### Sample Protocol
A PAX8-BioID construct was introduced in the endogenous PAX8 locus of IGROV-1 cells using CRISPR. Biotinylated proteins were purified with Streptavidin and analysed by quantitative mass spectrometry using TMT labeling.

### Data Protocol
Mass spec data was processed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer and a set of in-house Python scripts.
