### Title
Plasma Proteome Dynamics in the Pig Model of Trauma

### Description
The effect of IV-administered Vitamin C on the plasma proteome in the pig trauma model was investigated with label free proteomics. Plasma samples were drawn from 9 male Sinclair swine at baseline, post-trauma, and 0.25, 2, and 4 hours post resuscitation with 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch. Swine were randomized to receive either saline, low-dose VitC (50 mg/kg), or high-dose VitC (200 mg/kg) during volume resuscitation (N = 3/treatment). High performance LC-MS/MS proteomics was then used to quantitatively measure plasma protein levels over time.

### Sample Protocol
Depletion of albumin and IgG from all plasma samples followed by filter-assisted sample preparation (FASP-10kDa MWCO: reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin).

### Data Protocol
Proteomic datasets were processed in Proteome Discoverer (ver. 2.2.0.388) and searched with SEQUEST HT against the Uniprot Swine Proteome FASTA database (download: 8/29/2018). Search conditions were as follows: protease = trypsin, full; MS mass accuracy = 5ppm; MS/MS mass accuracy = 0.02Da; fixed modifications = carbamidomethyl (Cys); variable modifications = acetyl (N-terminus) and oxidation (Met); and a FDR = 1%.
