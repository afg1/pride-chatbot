### Title
Data independent MS phenotyping of melanoma tissue specimens

### Description
Phenotyping of Stage III BRAF or NRAS mutant melanoma tissue specimens to predict drug response and patient survival

### Sample Protocol
Tissues were lysed, run for 1 cm into a SDS-PAGE gel, reduced (DTT), alkylated (IAA), digested with trypsin and profiled by LC-SWATH using an in-house spectral library generated by Multiphase LC-MS/MS (Krisp et al. MCP 2015)for online SCX-RP LC-MS/MS of patient derived melanoma cell lines (PXD002725) and and 1D LC-MS/MS of pooled BRAF and NRAS tissue specimens.

### Data Protocol
ProteinPilot 5.0 search results (.group) of the cell lines and tissue specimens were imported into PeakView 2.1 with SWATH 2.0. exported as text files and merged using SWATHXtend software (Wu et al. MCP 2016). Only non-shared and unmodified peptides (confidence >= 99%) were extracted and protein areas used for Tissue assessment. Perseus 2.5 was used for further data analysis.
