### Title
HYPK affects proteostasis by facilitating co-translational imprinting of the proteome with acetylation marks

### Description
N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The NatA complex is the dominant regulator of the N-acetylome in all eukaryotes. The Huntingtin yeast partner K (HYPK) physically interacts with the NatA/NAA50 comples in metazoan and we describe HYPK as a critical regulator of NatA acivity. This proteome dataset compares the HYPK mutation Arabidopsis lines hypk-1 and hypk-3 to wild type Arabidopsis.

### Sample Protocol
Grinded Arabidopsis samples were processed with the Preomics iST protocol. After eluting from the solid phase extraction material, samples were completely dried and resuspended in buffer A* (2 % acetonitrile (v/v), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) and sonicated.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed using MaxQuant version 1.6.2.10 with a UniProt FASTA file.
