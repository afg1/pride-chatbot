### Title
Proteomic Identification of Lung Adenocarcinoma and Normal Lung Tissue

### Description
To identify proteomic of lung adenocarcinoma, we collected five pairs of lung adenocarcinoma and normal lung tissues from the clinic for analysis

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction and digestion Samples were thoroughly grounded into powder in a mortar precooled (liquid nitrogen). Four volumes of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor, 50 μM PR-619) were added to each sample group, then lysed via sonication. Samples were centrifuged (12,000 g/10 min at 4°C) and the supernatant was transferred into new tubes. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit. An equal protein mass from each sample was withdrawn for enzymatic hydrolysis. Volumes were adjusted using the lysis buffer. Then, trichloroacetic acid (20%) was slowly added to the mixture, which was vortexed and precipitated for 2 h at 4°C. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged (4,500 g/5 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed (2–3 times) with precooled acetone and subsequently dried. Tetraethylammonium bromide was added at a final concentration of 200 mM. The pellet was dispersed using sonication and trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 to overnight digestion. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mM and reduced at 56°C for 30 min. Finally, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 11 mM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

### Data Protocol
Results obtained from mass spectrometric analysis were searched using Maxquant (version 1.6.6.0) and we used the Homosapiens_9606 dataset from Uniprot (https://www.uniprot.org). We added common protein contaminants to the dataset to calculate the false positive rate (FDR) caused by random matching. The FDR was used to eliminate the protein contamination effect on the results.
