### Title
Diel proteomes of field Trichodesmium populations

### Description
Diel proteomes of Trichodesmium colonies sampled from the field on March 10, 2018 from the Eastern subtropical Atlantic at 65 22.420W 17 0.284 N. These proteomes inform a broad study of diel proteome oscillations in Trichodesmium that support simultaneous photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation during the day.

### Sample Protocol
Trichodesmium colonies of mixed morphology were collected in biological triplicate by gentle hand-picking followed by two rinses in 0.2um sterile filtered trace metal clean seawater and decanting onto a 0.2um supor filter. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until analysis. Proteins were extracted with SDS detergent and trypsin digested by a polyacrylamide tube gel method. Peptides were analyzed on a Michrom Advance HPLC coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham MA) with a Michrom Advance CaptiveSpray source. A four hour one-dimension chromatography gradient (0.1% formic acid and 0.2% formic acid in 99.9% acetonitrile) was performed using a C18 column (0.1 x 150 mm ID, 3uM particle size, 120A por size, C18 Reprosil-Gold, Dr. Maisch GmbH, packed in a New Objective PicoFrit column). MS1 scans were monitored between m/z 380-1280 with 5s dynmaic exclusion.

### Data Protocol
Raw spectra were searched using the SequestHT algorithm implemented in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 using a publicly available Trichodesmium metagenome (JGI IMG ID 2821477806). Search parameters were 10ppm parent mass tolerance, 0.6 Da fragment mass tolerance, cysteine modification + 57.022 and methionine modification +16. Protein identifications were made via PeptideProphet implemented in Scaffold (Proteome Software) with a 0.06% peptide and 1.5% protein global false discovery rates (FDR).
