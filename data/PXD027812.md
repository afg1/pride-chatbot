### Title
Proteome landscape of schizophrenia in patient-derived cerebral organoids

### Description
We utilized patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate 3D cerebral organoids to model neuropathology of Scz during this critical period. We discovered that Scz organoids exhibited ventricular neuropathology resulting in altered progenitor survival and disrupted neurogenesis. cz organoids principally differed not in their proteomic diversity, but specifically in their total quantity of disease and neurodevelopmental factors at the molecular level. Provides unique insights into the proteome landscape of schizophrenia in patient-derived cerebral organoids

### Sample Protocol
TMT mass-spectrometry proteomics was performed on organoids reduced with dithiotreitol and underwent alkylation with iodoacetamide before tryptic digestion. Peptide suspensions were desalted using C18 stage-tips prior to mass spectrometry analysis. All spectra were acquired in data dependent acquisition on an Oribtrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) pump.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were pre-processed as described and processed using MaxQuant. Spectra were searched against the full set of reference human protein sequences annotated in UniProt using Andromeda. Data was searched as described [41] with fixed modification, cysteine carbamidomethylation and variable modifications, N-acetylation and methionine oxidation. Searches were performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance for total protein level analysis. Further modifications included TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.16293 Da) set as static modifications. Peptides shorter than seven amino acids were not considered for further analysis because of lack of uniqueness, and a 1% False-Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to filter poor identifications at both the peptide and protein level. Protein identification required at least one unique or razor peptide per protein group. Contaminants, and reverse identification were excluded from further data analysis.
