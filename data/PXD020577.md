### Title
Shewanella oneidensis outer membrane and outer membrane vesicles

### Description
This project compares the outer membrane proteome to the proteome of outer membrane vesicles of the bacterium Shewanella onedensis. S. oneidensis outer membrane was purified via the sarkosyl method described in (Brown, 2010). A 50 mL overnight culture of cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min. cell pellet suspended in 20 mL of 20 mM ice-cold sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and passed four times through a French Press (12000 lb/in2). The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000× g for 30 min to remove unbroken cells. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h to pellet membranes. Crude membranes were suspended in 20 mL 0.5% Sarkosyl in 20 mM sodium phosphate and shaken horizontally at 200 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. The crude membrane sample was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the OM. The pellet of OM was washed in ice-cold sodium phosphate and recentrifuged. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm pore size filters to remove remaining bacterial cells. Vesicles were obtained by centrifugation at 38,400 x g for 1 h at 4°C in an Avanti J-20XP centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc). Pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) and filtered through 0.45 μm pore size filters. Vesicles were again pelleted as described above and finally resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, pH 6.8. Extracellular DNA, flagella, and pili can all be co-purified. Protocol was adapted from (Perez-Cruz, 2013).

### Sample Protocol
To prepare for mass spectrometry samples were treated sequentially with urea, TCEP, iodoactinamide, lysl endopeptidase, trypisin, and formic acid. Peptides were then desalted by HPLC with a Microm Bioresources C8 peptide macrotrap (3x8mm). The digested samples were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on a nanoflow LC system, EASY-nLC 1200, (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a QExactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source. Samples were directly loaded onto a PicoFrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed in house with ReproSil-Pur C18AQ 1.9 um resin (120A° pore size, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany). The 20cm x 50μm ID column was heated to 60° C. The peptides were separated with a 120 min gradient at a flow rate of 220 nL/min. The gradient was as follows: 2–6% Solvent B (7.5 min), 6-25% B (82.5 min), and 25-40% B (30 min) and to 100% B (9min). Solvent A consisted of 97.8% H2O, 2% ACN, and 0.2% formic acid and solvent B consisted of 19.8% H2O, 80% ACN, and 0.2% formic acid. The QExactive HF Orbitrap was operated in data dependent mode with the Tune (version 2.7 SP1build 2659) instrument control software. Spray voltage was set to 2.5 kV, S-lens RF level at 50, and heated capillary at 275 °C. Full scan resolution was set to 60,000 at m/z 200. Full scan target was 3 × 106 with a maximum injection time of 15 ms. Mass range was set to 300−1650 m/z. For data dependent MS2 scans the loop count was 12, target value was set at 1 × 105, and intensity threshold was kept at 1 × 105. Isolation width was set at 1.2 m/z and a fixed first mass of 100 was used. Normalized collision energy was set at 28. Peptide match was set to off, and isotope exclusion was on. Data acquisition was controlled by Xcalibur (4.0.27.13) and all data was acquired in profile mode.

### Data Protocol
The raw data was analyzed using MaxQuant (v 1.6.1.0). Spectra were searched against the S. oneidensis sequences from UniProt as well as a contaminant protein database. Trypsin was specified as the digestion enzyme and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification and protein N-terminal acetylation as well as methionine oxidation were specified as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was 4.5ppm after recalibration within MaxQuant. Spectrum, peptide, and protein scores were thresholded to achieve a 1% false discovery rate at each level. False discovery rates were estimated using a target-decoy approach. Label-free quantitation and match-between-runs was enabled. Missing values were imputed from a normal distribution centered near the limit of quantitation.
