### Title
The non-apoptotic function of Caspase-8 in negatively regulating the CDK9 mediated Ser2 phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II in cervical cancer

### Description
Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed and fatal gynecological cancer. 15-61% of all cases metastasize and develop chemoresistance, reducing the 5-year survival of cervical cancer patients to as low as 17%. Therefore, unraveling the mechanisms contributing to metastasis is critical in developing better-targeted therapies against it. Here, we have identified a novel mechanism where nuclear Caspase-8 directly interacts with and inhibits the activity of CDK9, thereby modulating RNAPII-mediated global transcription, including those of cell-migration and -invasion-associated genes. Crucially, low Caspase-8 expression in cervical cancer patients leads to poor prognosis, higher CDK9 phosphorylation at Thr186, and increased RNAPII activity in cervical cancer cell lines and patient biopsies. Caspase-NT8 knock-out cells were also more resistant to the small-molecule CDK9 inhibitor BAY1251152 in both 2D- and 3D-culture conditions. Combining BAY1251152 with Cisplatin synergistically overcame chemoresistance of Caspase-8 deficient cervical cancer cells. Therefore, Caspase-8 expression could be a marker in chemoresistant cervical tumors, suggesting CDK9 inhibitor treatment for their sensitization to Cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

### Sample Protocol
Global protein expression profiling was conducted as described before. Briefly, non-synchronized (NS) and S/G2-phase synchronized (synch.) HeLa WT and KO cells were suspended in 500 Âµl lysis buffer [1% SDS/ 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) (with protease and phosphatase inhibitors)] and sonicated. After precipitation from the cleared lysates with acetone, the dried protein pellets were suspended in solubilization buffer (9 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate), reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Next, the protein samples were digested with Lys-C (Wako Chemicals) and trypsin (Promega), followed by a C18 peptide clean-up. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling was carried out according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the peptide mixtures were combined in a multiplexed sample, including one TMT channel containing a reference sample consisting of equal peptide amounts from each sample. After high-pH C18 RP kit pre-fractionation (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the samples were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex). After clean-up and concentration on a pre-column (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ (5 Âµm); Dr. Maisch GmbH), the samples were separated on an analytical column (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ (1.9 Âµm); Dr. Maisch GmbH).

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were processed using the MaxQuant software (version 1.6.5.0, MPI for Biochemistry). Using the Andromeda search engine, fragment ion mass spectra were searched against the UniProt human reference proteome supplemented with 245 frequently observed contaminant. The FDR was set to 1% on a decoy database approach at both the peptide and protein levels. Further data was evaluated using the Perseus software (v.1.6.0.7, MPI for Biochemistry). Potential contaminants, hits to the decoy database, and proteins identified solely with modified peptides were removed. Proteins identified with less than 2 unique peptides were excluded from further analysis. The TMT reporter intensities within each LC/MS run were normalized for equal sample loading and individual measurements by scaling to an internal reference containing equal peptide amounts of each sample.
