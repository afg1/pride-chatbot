### Title
Human-derived PBMCs were stimulated by different groups to kill tumor cells.After 48 hours, PBMCs were taken out, and the enrichment of activated proteins of relevant lymphocytes and the regulation of pathways were examined by proteomics.

### Description
In this study, proteomics was used to explore the activation of lymphocytes and related pathways in PBMCs of different stimulation groups. In our study, proteomics analysis showed that the immune cells in PBMCs activated by stimulation group  exhibit improved functions related to white blood cell activation, proliferation and cytotoxicity during biological processes. At the same time, KEGG pathway analysis showed that the signaling pathways’ key proteins for leukocyte transendothelial migration, Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, JAK-STAT (involved in many important biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune regulation), DNA replication and Th17 cell differentiation were up-regulated; whereas the key proteins of necroptosis pathways in immune cells were down-regulated.

### Sample Protocol
The PBMCs were separated from the blood of volunteers by ficoll, stimulated by CD3, CD28, IL7, and IL15, and then used for testing.PBMC stimulated with different stimulation groups were co-cultured with tumor cells for 48 hours,take out the PBMC of each group after 48h (3 replicates per group).After washing the PBMC 3 times with PBS,through the organic combination of a series of cutting-edge technologies such as protein extraction, restriction enzyme digestion, TMT labeling, high performance liquid chromatography fractionation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry tandem analysis, database search, and bioinformatics analysis, the samples are used for quantitative proteome research.

### Data Protocol
Based on the RAW files obtained by mass spectrometry detection, 1) a sample-specific protein database was constructed according to the source of the samples, and then the analysis software was used to search the database;2) Then, based on the database search results, the peptide and protein levels were analyzed for quality control;3) Common functional database annotations were carried out for the identified proteins, including GO, KEGG, INTERPRO, COG and STRING databases;4) Then quantitative analysis of the protein was carried out, including quantitative distribution and reproducibility analysis;5) Conduct difference screening based on quantitative results and draw statistical charts related to difference analysis;6) Then, the functional classification and statistical analysis of the differential proteins were performed, including GO secondary classification, KEGG pathway classification, and COG/KOG classification.7) Based on the statistical results obtained by different classification methods, enrichment analysis was conducted by using Fisher's exact test;8) When the project had multiple experimental groups, the functional association of different proteins under different experimental conditions was compared through rich cluster analysis;9) Then, through PPI (protein-protein interaction network) analysis, key regulatory proteins under specific experimental conditions were screened out.

### Publication Abstract
BsAb (bispecific antibody)-armed oncolytic viruses (OVs) are effective in regulating tumor microenvironment. However, oHSV2 (oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 2) expressing immune checkpoints targeting BsAb molecules are not reported. Here, we generated oHSV2-armed PD-L1/CD3 BsAb and established pharmacodynamic evaluation models, which suggested that our oHSV2-BsAb molecules have an improved oncolytic potency <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo.</i> The oHSV2 viruses armed with BsAb molecules targeting programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/CD3 or CD19/CD3 (oHSV2-PD-L1/CD3-BsAb or oHSV2-CD19/mCD3-BsAb) were constructed; besides inducing oncolysis in virus-infected tumor cells, the modified oncolytic virus oHSV2-PD-L1/CD3-BsAb can also activate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by releasing PD-L1/CD3 BsAb and thereby induce PBMC-mediated killing of PD-L1-positive tumor cells, regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The expressed PD-L1/CD3 BsAb can upregulate the activation markers of T cells in PBMCs and induce different cytokine secretion. The activation of T cells and the enrichment of related immune regulatory pathways are further confirmed by proteomics. It also demonstrated that the OVs or PBMCs could upregulate PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells through transforming "cold tumors" with low PD-L1 expression into "hot tumors" with high PD-L1 expression, which can facilitate the targeting of BsAb molecules and enhance the effect of oncolysis. oHSV2-PD-L1/CD3-BsAb or oHSV2-CD19/mCD3-BsAb showed an enhanced oncolytic effect <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> compared to backbone virus oHSV2-GFP. Our results showed that the newly designed oHSV2-BsAb had enhanced therapeutic effects against solid tumors and provided a new option of immunotherapy.
