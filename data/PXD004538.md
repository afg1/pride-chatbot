### Title
Quantitative metaproteomics highlight the metabolic contributions of uncultured phylotypes in a thermophilic anaerobic digester

### Description
In this study, we used multiple meta-omic approaches to characterize the microbial community and the active metabolic pathways of a stable industrial biogas reactor operating at thermophilic temperatures (60°C) and elevated levels of free ammonia (367 mg NH3-N/L).

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from the biomass using two different approaches, one tailored for cellular proteins and one from the liquid fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by mass spec (Q-Exactive).

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant and Perseus were used for protein identification, quantification and data analysis. Intensity-based label-free quantification (LFQ) was used to elucidate relative abundances of the proteins and pathways within the biogas reactor.
