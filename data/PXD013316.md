### Title
Cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5 is required for pain signalling in both human neurons and mouse models

### Description
CDKL5 Immunoprecipitation shows a role for Cdkl5 in controlling axonal outgrowth and nociception via interaction with CaMKIIα

### Sample Protocol
The cortex of three mice (P65) was removed and immediately lysed in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 7.5 20mM, NaCl 150mM, EDTA 1mM, EGTA 1mM, Triton X-100 0.1%, PIC Sigma P8340-1x, 1mM DTT, PhosSTOP Sigma P0044-1x) on ice (glass pestle Thermo-Fisher FB56679) and centrifuged (14000g 15min). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For each sample, 1mg of protein was treated for 30min with 500U Benzonase (E1014 Sigma) at 37°C, then exposed (overnight wheel, 4°C) to 1μg of Cdkl5-Ab (Sigma HPA002847) or 1μg Rabbit IgG (Jackson 011000003 lot95014). Magnetic beads (40μl 50% Dynabeads Protein G 10003D, Life Technologies) were subsequently added to the samples, and the mixture was further incubated on the wheel for 2hrs at 4°C. The beads were washed three times (3x20m washes with lysis buffer, wheel 4°C) and proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in NuPage Sample Reducing Agent - DTT (30μl, Thermo-Fisher NP0009; 80°C) and analyzed by Mass Spectrometry. Equal amounts of volume were loaded onto Invitrogen 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels and run in MES buffer for 10 min.  After fixation in 7% acetic acid containing 40% methanol and subsequently staining for 30 min using Colloidal Blue staining kit (Life technologies) protein lane was excised from the gel, chopped and destained (50% ethanol in 25 mM NH4HCO3) for 15 min rotating at room temperature and dehydrated for 10 min rotating in 100% acetonitrile. Vacuum dried samples were rehydrated and reduced for 60 min in reduction buffer (10mM DTT in 50mM NH4HCO3 pH 8.0) at 56°C and subsequently alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide in 50mM NH4HCO3 pH 8.0 for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Dehydrated and vacuum dried samples were trypsin digested (1µg trypsin/sample in 50mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8.0) at 37°C over night. Stepwise peptide extraction was done as follows: twice extraction solution (30% acetonitrile) and 100% acetonitrile for 15 min at 25°C shaking at 1400 rpm. Reductive methylation for quantification on peptide level was performed as described in Hsu JL et al. (2003). Chemically label peptides were mixed 1:1 as follows: EXT_CF_0117 = CDKL5 IP (Animal_1), Heavy label + IgG IP (Animal_1), Light label EXT_CF_0118 = IgG IP (Animal_1), Heavy label + CDKL5 IP (Animal_1), Light label EXT_CF_0164 = CDKL5 IP (Animal_3), Heavy label + IgG IP (Animal_3), Light label EXT_CF_0166 = CDKL5 IP (Animal_3), Heavy label + IgG IP (Animal_3), Light label EXT_CF_0170 = CDKL5 IP (Animal_2), Heavy label + IgG IP (Animal_2), Light label EXT_CF_0171 =IgG IP (Animal_2), Heavy label + CDKL5 IP (Animal_2), Light label Light label = DimethylLys0 and DimethylNter0 and Heavy label = DimethylLys4 and DimethylNter4

### Data Protocol
Spectra were recorded with a Q Exactive Plus operating in positive mode and recording TOP10 MSMS. Spectra were searched against Mus Musculus Uniprot database (downloaded 8th January 2018 with 53819 entries) in MaxQuant Version 1.5.2.8.
