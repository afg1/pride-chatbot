### Title
Influenza A virus- integrated glycomics, proteomics and glycoproteomics

### Description
This study describes how site-specific glycosylation of Influenza A virus changes in response to pressures from the host immune system, thereby allowing the virus to evolve and escape neutralization. We compared the glycosylation patterns of different virus strains as they evolve and correlated this information with changes in biological activity. Furthermore, modelling and molecular dynamics studies were performed to understand the basis for glycan microheterogeneity and interactions of the virions with host-immune molecules.

### Sample Protocol
All samples were subjected to proteomics, glycomics and glycoprotemics experiments. Virus samples were deglycosylated and subjected to C18 LC-MS/MS for proteomics. Released glycans were subjected to HILIC-MS for glycomics. intact glycopeptides were analyzed by online HILIC enrichment and C18 LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
Proteomics data were analyzed using PEAKS for error-tolerant database and de novo proteomics searches. Glycomics and glycoproteomics data were analyzed using an in-house data analysis pipeline, GlycReSoft.

### Publication Abstract
Despite sustained biomedical research effort, influenza A virus remains an imminent threat to the world population and a major healthcare burden. The challenge in developing vaccines against influenza is the ability of the virus to mutate rapidly in response to selective immune pressure. Hemagglutinin is the predominant surface glycoprotein and the primary determinant of antigenicity, virulence and zoonotic potential. Mutations leading to changes in the number of HA glycosylation sites are often reported. Such genetic sequencing studies predict at best the disruption or creation of sequons for N-linked glycosylation; they do not reflect actual phenotypic changes in HA structure. Therefore, combined analysis of glycan micro and macro-heterogeneity and bioassays will better define the relationships among glycosylation, viral bioactivity and evolution. We present a study that integrates proteomics, glycomics and glycoproteomics of HA before and after adaptation to innate immune system pressure. We combined this information with glycan array and immune lectin binding data to correlate the phenotypic changes with biological activity. Underprocessed glycoforms predominated at the glycosylation sites found to be involved in viral evolution in response to selection pressures and interactions with innate immune-lectins. To understand the structural basis for site-specific glycan microheterogeneity at these sites, we performed structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that the presence of immature, high-mannose type glycans at a particular site correlated with reduced accessibility to glycan remodeling enzymes. Further, the high mannose glycans at sites implicated in immune lectin recognition were predicted to be capable of forming trimeric interactions with the immune-lectin surfactant protein-D.
