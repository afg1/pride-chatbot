### Title
Comparative proteomic profiling of Synechocystis

### Description
This works performed proteomic profiling of two Synechocystis strains and reveal characteristics of each strain.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysis, and proteme was digested with trypsin. Samples were analyzed using DDA MS (after high pH RPLC fractionation) and DIA MS.

### Data Protocol
DDA data were used to build a library for DIA analysis. DDA raw files were searched with Comet and processed through TPP. DIA raw files were imported and processed with Skyline and MSstats.
