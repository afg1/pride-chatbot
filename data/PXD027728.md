### Title
Emergence and intensification of dairying in the Caucasus and Eurasian steppes

### Description
Archaeological and archaeogenetic evidence points to the Pontic-Caspian steppe zone between the Caucasus and the Black Sea as the crucible from which the earliest steppe pastoralist societies arose and spread, ultimately influencing populations from Europe to Inner Asia. However, little is known about their economic foundations and the factors that may have contributed to their extensive mobility. Here we investigate the dental calculus proteomes of 45 individuals spanning the Neolithic to Greco-Roman periods in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe and neighboring South Caucasus, Oka-Volga-Don, and East Urals regions.

### Sample Protocol
Archaeological dental calculus samples from 45 individuals, and n=5 extraction blanks were processed using a filter-aided sample preparation protocol (FASP), modified for ancient proteins (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.7vwhn7e). Extracted peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class system (Waters AG, Baden-DÃ¤ttwil, Switzerland) at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich of the University/ETH Zurich

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were converted to Mascot generic files by MSConvert version 3.0.11781 using the 100 most intense peaks in each spectra. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.6.0). Mascot was set up to search the SwissProt Release 2019_08 database (560,823 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin, with automatic decoy option. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.050 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM. The number of missed cleavages was specified as one. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of methionine and proline were specified in Mascot as variable modifications.   Scaffold version Scaffold_4.9.0 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate protein and peptide identifications for each sample independently. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than a 90% probability by the PeptideProphet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at a greater than 95% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Probabilities for proteins were assigned using the Protein Prophet algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides that could not be differentiated based on MS-MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony and proteins that shared significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a greater than 90% probability using the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction.
