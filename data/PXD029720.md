### Title
Human Jurkat T cells SENP1 immunoprecipitates LC-MS

### Description
Identification of peptides matching to LCK in SENP1 immunoprecipitates from Jurkat E6.1 T cells by mass spectrometry

### Sample Protocol
After immunoprecipitation with SENP1 antibody in Jurkat E6.1 T cells, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gel bands of interest were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion. After the desalting procedure, the peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem MS.

### Data Protocol
The peptides were analyzed by the LTQ Orbitrap Elite system and Easy-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then proteins in SENP1 immunoprecipitates were identified with Protein Discovery software.
