### Title
Carrot (Daucus carota L.) seed germination was promoted by hydro-electro hybrid priming through regulating the accumulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism

### Description
Asynchronized and nonuniform seed germination is causing obstacles to the large-scale cultivation of carrot (Daucus carota L.). In the present study, the combination of high voltage electrostatic field treatment (EF) with hydropriming (HYD), namely hydro-electro hybrid priming (HEHP), significantly improved all germination indicators of carrot seeds, and the promoting effect was superior to that of the HYD treatment. A TMT-based proteomic analysis was conducted on the carrot seeds, and the maximum number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) appeared between CK and HEHP. KEGG analysis revealed that the upregulated DAPs were mainly enriched in the pathways related to protein synthesis and degradation such as “ribosome” and “proteasome”, while the downregulated DAPs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-related pathways. Furthermore, the maximum DAPs were annotated in carbohydrate metabolism. Some proteins identified as key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylate cycle, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway showed enhanced abundance in priming treatments. The activities of several key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were also enhanced by the priming treatments, especially the HEHP treatment. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the effect of priming is mainly reflected before sowing. In conclusion, the optimal effect of HEHP is to regulate the synthesis and degradation of proteins in seeds to meet the requirements of germination and initiate the utilization of seed storage reserves and respiratory metabolism. The present work expanded the understanding of the response mechanism of carrot seed germination to priming and the biological effects of high voltage electrostatic field.

### Sample Protocol
For the HYD and HEHP treatments, the carrot seeds were first soaked in distilled water at 20 °C for 6 h. Then for HEHP, the positive and negative electrodes of a BM-201 electrostatic field generator (made in Jiangsu, China) were connected to two 10 cm×10 cm copper plates placed 1 cm apart; the seeds were placed on the lower plate (cathode) and exposed to a 2 kV/cm EF for 90 s after absorbing the surface moisture with absorbent paper. The EF parameters were widely selected by pre-experiments. Then HYD and HEHP were imbibed in a climate chamber (QHX-300BSH-III, made in Shanghai, China) set at 22 °C at 98% humidity for 48 h in the dark, and desiccated at 25 °C in a drum wind dryer until the initial weight was achieved.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer against the carrot database (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000077755). The false discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identification during library search is set to FDR ≤ 0.01. The protein contains at least one specific peptide. The screening criteria of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were as follows: P value < 0.05 and FC > 1.5 were identified as upregulated DAPs, P value < 0.05 and FC < 0.67 were identified as downregulated DAPs. Annotation of DAPs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome; http://geneontology.org/) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). DAPs were also used for KEGG enrichment analysis.

### Publication Abstract
Asynchronized and non-uniform seed germination is causing obstacles to the large-scale cultivation of carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> L.). In the present study, the combination of high voltage electrostatic field treatment (EF) with hydropriming (HYD), namely hydro-electro hybrid priming (HEHP), significantly improved all germination indicators of carrot seeds, and the promoting effect was superior to that of the HYD treatment. A tandem mass tags (TMT)-based proteomic analysis identified 4,936 proteins from the seeds, and the maximum number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) appeared between CK and HEHP. KEGG analysis revealed that the upregulated DAPs were mainly enriched in the pathways related to protein synthesis and degradation such as "ribosome" and "proteasome," while the downregulated DAPs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-related pathways. Furthermore, the maximum DAPs were annotated in carbohydrate metabolism. Some proteins identified as key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylate cycle, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway showed enhanced abundance in priming treatments. The activities of several key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were also enhanced by the priming treatments, especially the HEHP treatment. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the effect of priming is mainly reflected before sowing. In conclusion, the optimal effect of HEHP is to regulate the synthesis and degradation of proteins in seeds to meet the requirements of germination and initiate the utilization of seed storage reserves and respiratory metabolism. The present work expanded the understanding of the response mechanism of carrot seed germination to priming and the biological effects of high voltage electrostatic field.
