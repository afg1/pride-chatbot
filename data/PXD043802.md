### Title
renal cancer cell line ACHN LC-MSMS

### Description
To predict the protein that interact with FOXA2 and illustrate the important role and the biological mechanism it may involved of FOXA2 in renal cancer.

### Sample Protocol
Add 800 μL of 0.1M NH4HCO3/30%ACN to each sample, add the gel block, and wash until the protein turns colorless. Remove the supernatant. Immediately add 800 μL of H2O to stop the reaction for 10 minutes, and remove the supernatant. Add 800 μL of 100mM NH4HCO3 to each sample and let it sit for 20 minutes. Remove the supernatant. Add 40 μL of 100mM DTT and 360 μL of 100mM NH4HCO3 to each sample and incubate at 56°C for 30 minutes to reduce the proteins. Remove the supernatant. Add 100 μL of 100% ACN to each tube and let it sit for 5 minutes, then remove. Then add 280 μL of 100mM NH4HCO3 and 120 μL of 200mM IAA (prepared freshly and stored in the dark) to each sample, and incubate in a dark place at room temperature for 20 minutes. Remove the supernatant, add 100 μL of 100mM NH4HCO3, let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, and remove the supernatant. Add 100 μL of 100% ACN, let it sit for 5 minutes, then remove and freeze-dry. Take each sample and add 600 μL of 20ng/μL Trypsin, place it in a refrigerator at 4°C for approximately 30 minutes to allow the gel block to swell. Then add approximately 100 μL of 50mM NH4HCO3 buffer, and perform overnight digestion at 37°C. Extract the digestion solution and transfer it to a new centrifuge tube. Add 100 μL of 60% ACN/0.1%TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) to the gel block sample and sonicate for 15 minutes. Extract the solution, repeat the extraction process 3 times, combine, and freeze-dry. After digestion, desalt and concentrate the peptide using a C18 StageTip column. Then dissolve the peptide in 0.1% formic acid solution for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. For each sample, an appropriate amount of peptide is taken and separated using a nano-flow Easy nLC 1200 chromatography system (Thermo). The buffer consists of Solution A, a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, and Solution B, a mixture of 0.1% formic acid, acetonitrile, and water (with acetonitrile at 80% concentration). The chromatography column is initially equilibrated with 100% Solution A. After sample injection into the Trap Column (100µm20mm, 5µm C18 Dr. Maisch GmbH), the separation is performed using the chromatographic analysis column (75µm150mm, 3µm C18 Dr. Maisch GmbH) with a gradient elution at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The liquid phase separation gradient is as follows: 0 minutes to 2 minutes, a linear gradient from 2% to 8% of Solution B; 2 minutes to 42 minutes, a linear gradient from 8% to 28% of Solution B; 42 minutes to 50 minutes, a linear gradient from 28% to 40% of Solution B; 50 minutes to 51 minutes, a linear gradient from 40% to 100% of Solution B; 51 minutes to 60 minutes, Solution B maintained at 100%. After peptide separation, DDA (data-dependent acquisition) mass spectrometry analysis is performed using the Q Exactive HF X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The analysis duration is 60 minutes with the following settings: positive ion mode, mass range for full scan: 300-1500 m/z, first-level mass spectrometry resolution 60,000 @ m/z 200, AGC target 3e6, first-level Maximum IT 50 ms. For second-level mass spectrometry analysis of peptides, the following method is employed: after each full scan, the 20 most intense precursor ions are selected for fragmentation (MS2 scan), second-level mass spectrometry resolution 15,000 @ m/z 200, AGC target 1e5, second-level Maximum IT 50 ms, MS2 Activation Type: HCD, isolation window 1.6 m/z, normalized collision energy 28.

### Publication Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a frequent malignancy of the urinary system with high mortality and morbidity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC progression are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified FOXA2, a pioneer transcription factor, as a driver oncogene for RCC. We show that FOXA2 was commonly upregulated in human RCC samples and promoted RCC proliferation, as evidenced by assays of cell viability, colony formation, migratory and invasive capabilities, and stemness properties. Mechanistically, we found that FOXA2 promoted RCC cell proliferation by transcriptionally activating HIF2&#x3b1; expression in&#xa0;vitro and in&#xa0;vivo. Furthermore, we found that FOXA2 could interact with VHL (von Hippel&#x2012;Lindau), which ubiquitinated FOXA2 and controlled its protein stability in RCC cells. We showed that mutation of lysine at position 264 to arginine in FOXA2 could mostly abrogate its ubiquitination, augment its activation effect on HIF2&#x3b1; expression, and promote RCC proliferation in&#xa0;vitro and RCC progression in&#xa0;vivo. Importantly, elevated expression of FOXA2 in patients with RCC positively correlated with the expression of HIF2&#x3b1; and was associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of FOXA2 in RCC development and provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of FOXA2-driven pathological processes in RCC.
