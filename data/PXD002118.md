### Title
Social interaction dependent protein expression dynamics in hippocampus of the animals with strong features of dominance and submissiveness

### Description
Social interaction dependent protein expression dynamics in hippocampus of the animals with strong features of dominance and submissiveness.

### Sample Protocol
Hippocampi were isolated from mouse brains, lysed and subjected to in-solution digestion.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were imported to Elucidator v3.3 for feature detection, isotopic clustering and RT alignment. Detected clusters were then annotated using results from Proteinlynx Global Server v2.5.2.
