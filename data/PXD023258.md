### Title
BUB-1 targets PP2A:B56 to regulates chromosome congression during meiosis I in C. elegans oocytes

### Description
This project consisted in identifying phosphorylated residues in BUB-1 in C. elegans embryo extract. This is part of our general interest in identifying PTMs playing a role during meiosis.

### Sample Protocol
IP samples were processed through SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12% + MOP Buffer. Gel bands excised, destained and in-gel reductively alkylated with DTT/IAA prior to in-gel overnight trypsin digestion. Peptides extracted and samples analysed by nLC-MS/MS on Q-Exactive Plus for protein identification. Peptides from gel band GFP-Top enriched for phosphopeptides using a Zr-IMAC support (Resyn Biosciences)prior to analysis by nLC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive Plus.

### Data Protocol
Data Analysis:Gel bands Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ .RAW data files were extracted and converted to mascot generic files (.mgf) using MSC Convert. Extracted data then searched against Caenorhabditis elegans & Local Peptide (sequence provided by researcher) databases using the Mascot Search Engine (Mascot Daemon Version 2.3.2).   Search Parameters used for Search Type of search          : MS/MS Ion Search Enzyme                   : Trypsin/P Fixed modifications     : Carbamidomethyl (C) Variable modifications  : Acetyl (N-term), Dioxidation (M), Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q) and Oxidation (M), Deamidation (NQ) Mass values              : Monoisotopic Protein Mass            : Unrestricted Peptide Mass Tolerance : ± 10 ppm (# 13C = 2) Fragment Mass Tolerance : ± 0.06 Da Max Missed Cleavages   : 2 Instrument type         : ESI-TRAP  Phosphopeptide Enriched Sample (GFP-Top) Data Analysis: Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ .RAW data files were extracted and converted to mascot generic files (.mgf) using MSC Convert.

### Publication Abstract
Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimer composed of scaffolding (A), catalytic (C), and regulatory (B) subunits. PP2A complexes with B56 subunits are targeted by Shugoshin and BUBR1 to protect centromeric cohesion and stabilise kinetochore-microtubule attachments in yeast and mouse meiosis. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the closest BUBR1 orthologue lacks the B56-interaction domain and Shugoshin is not required for meiotic segregation. Therefore, the role of PP2A in <i>C. elegans</i> female meiosis is unknown. We report that PP2A is essential for meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome dynamics during <i>C. elegans</i> female meiosis. BUB-1 is the main chromosome-targeting factor for B56 subunits during prometaphase I. BUB-1 recruits PP2A:B56 to the chromosomes via a newly identified LxxIxE motif in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and this recruitment is important for proper chromosome congression. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for B56 recruitment, essential for recruiting a pool of PP2A involved in chromosome congression during meiosis I.
