### Title
Proteomics profiling of mitotic arrest by transcriptional silencing of the Cdc20 homolog slp1 in fission yeast

### Description
Depletion of the APC/C activator Cdc20 arrests cells in metaphase with high levels of the mitotic cyclin (Cyclin B) and the Separase inhibitor Securin. In mammalian cells this arrest has been exploited for the treatment of cancer with drugs that engage the spindle assembly checkpoint and, recently, with chemical inhibitors of the APC/C. While most cells arrested in mitosis for prolonged periods undergo apoptosis, others skip cytokinesis and enter G1 with unsegregated chromosomes. This process, known as mitotic slippage, generates aneuploidy and increases genomic instability in the cancer cell. Here, we analyse the behaviour of fission yeast cells arrested in mitosis through the transcriptional silencing of the Cdc20 homolog slp1. While depletion of slp1 readily halts cells in metaphase, this arrest is only transient and a majority of cells eventually undergo cytokinesis and show steady mitotic dephosphorylation. As a result, we generated this label-free dataset with the aim of providing further insights into the global dynamics of protein expression under slp1 depletion and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the mitotic escape.

### Sample Protocol
All experiments were performed using label-free quantitative proteomics. Cultures were first grown to mid-exponential phase and shifted to EMM containing 15 uM of thiamine for 6 hr for inducing p41nmt1-slp1 repression. For sampling cells were collected by filtration, first washed out with 100 ml of PBS pH 7.2 and second washed out with 1 ml of STOP buffer. Pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. For protein extraction, cell pellets were dissolved in denaturing lysis buffer containing 8 M urea, protease inhibitors (cOmplete ™ Mini, Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitors (2mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM β-GP and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). Cell disruption was performed by agitation and homogenization with a cryogenic bead beating grinder (FastPrep®- 24 5G). After centifugation, 250 U of Benzonase® (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the protein extracts to remove nucleic acids and incubated for 10 min on ice. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). (Casado et al., Science Signaling 2013). 400 ug of total protein extract was reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C and prepared for peptide digestion after alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide and reduction of the urea concentration to 2M using the FASP™ protein digestion kit and following the manufacturer instructions (Expedeon) detailed by Wisniewski et al., Nat Methods 2009. Proteins were digested using trypsin in a ratio 1:100 w/w (Promega-V511) dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 18 hr at 37 °C. Digested peptides were then acidified to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and then desalted with 0.1% TFA, 5% acetonitrile (ACN) using Pierce® C18 tips-100 µl bed that were previously conditioned and equilibrated according to instructions (Thermo Scientific). The eluted peptides were dried under vacuum.Peptide identification and abundance measurements were performed on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer coupled to an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation LC system (both Thermo Scientific). Peptide mixtures were re-suspended in 14 µl 0.1% Formic acid (FA), 2% Acetonitrile (ACN), and injected twice (6 µl per injection). Each run consisted of a 4-hr elution gradient with two mobile phases (solvent A: 0.1% FA in water - solvent B: 0.1% FA in ACN). The eluting peptides from the LC- column (nC18, 75 µm x 50 cm, 2 µm particle size) were ionized in the electrospray and analyzed by the Orbitrap Elite using Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) as a activation method.

### Data Protocol
The raw mass spectrometry data was processed in Max Quant (Version 1.5.8.3,) using default parameters including multiplicity 1, trypsin with max. missed 2, LFQ, oxidation (M), fixed modifications (C), min peptide length 7/max peptide mass 4600, match between runs for peptide identification and separate LFQ in parameters group (Cox and Mann, 2008). The mapping of the proteins was searched against a Uniprot S. pombe proteome fasta file and corrected to discard common contaminant sequences using a FDR &lt; 0.01 and a decoy revert mode for identification of reverse sequences. Maxquant output file was processed using Perseus (Version 1.6.12.01) (Tyanova et al., 2016)

### Publication Abstract
Depletion of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) activator Cdc20 arrests cells in metaphase with high levels of the mitotic cyclin (Cyclin B) and the Separase inhibitor Securin. In mammalian cells this arrest has been exploited for the treatment of cancer with drugs that engage the spindle assembly checkpoint and, recently, with chemical inhibitors of the APC/C. While most cells arrested in mitosis for prolonged periods undergo apoptosis, others skip cytokinesis and enter G1 with unsegregated chromosomes. This process, known as mitotic slippage, generates aneuploidy and increases genomic instability in the cancer cell. Here, we analyze the behavior of fission yeast cells arrested in mitosis through the transcriptional silencing of the Cdc20 homolog <i>slp1</i>. While depletion of <i>slp1</i> readily halts cells in metaphase, this arrest is only transient and a majority of cells eventually undergo cytokinesis and show steady mitotic dephosphorylation. Notably, this occurs in the absence of Cyclin B (Cdc13) degradation. We investigate the involvement of phosphatase activity in these events and demonstrate that PP2A-B55<sup>Pab1</sup> is required to prevent septation and, during the arrest, its CDK-mediated inhibition facilitates the induction of cytokinesis. In contrast, deletion of PP2A-B56<sup>Par1</sup> completely abrogates septation. We show that this effect is partly due to this mutant entering mitosis with reduced CDK activity. Interestingly, both PP2A-B55<sup>Pab1</sup> and PP2A-B56<sup>Par1</sup>, as well as Clp1 (the homolog of the budding yeast mitotic phosphatase Cdc14) are required for the dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates during the escape. Finally, we show that the mitotic transcriptional wave controlled by the RFX transcription factor Sak1 facilitates the induction of cytokinesis and also requires the activity of PP2A-B56<sup>Par1</sup> in a mechanism independent of CDK.
