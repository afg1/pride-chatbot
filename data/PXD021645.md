### Description
Quantify region-dependent fluctuations on a proteome-wide scale, performing integrative analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome across AD stages in EC and FC.

### Sample Protocol
(Phospho)proteomic analysis  EC and FC samples derived from control and AD cases were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM DTT supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenates were spun down at 100.000 x g for 1 hour at 15°C. Protein quantitation was performed with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). The EC and FC phosphoproteomes and the corresponding proteomes across AD staging were independently analyzed by conventional label-free (Montoya A et al Methods 2011) and SWATH-MS (Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry) (Collins Nature Communications 2017), respectively.  Label-free phosphoproteomics: 600µg of protein were used to obtain the phosphorylated fractions from EC and FC across AD stages. For protein digestion, reduction was performed by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10mM and incubation at RT for 30 minutes. Subsequent alkylation by 30mM (final concentration) iodoacetamide was performed for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. An additional reduction step was performed by 30mM DTT (final concentration), allowing the reaction to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture was diluted to 0.6M urea using MilliQ-water, and after trypsin addition (Promega) (enzyme:protein, 1:50 w/w), the sample was incubated at 37ºC for 16h. Digestion was quenched by acidification (pH<6) with acetic acid. After protein enzymatic cleavage, peptide cleaning was performed using Pierce™ Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (ThermoFisher). To obtain the phosphorylated peptide fractions, the High-Select™ TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used according to manufacturer´s instructions. Phosphopeptide mixtures were separated by a reversed-phase chromatography using an Eksigent NanoLC ultra 2D pump fitted with an Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 column (0.075x250 mm, particle size 3 µm; ThermoFisher). Samples were first loaded for concentration into an Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 trap column (0.1x20 mm, particle size 5 µm; ThermoFisher). Mobile phases were 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a gradient from 2% B to 40% B in 120 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 10 min and 2% B for 10 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides were analyzed using a 5600 Triple-TOF mass-spectrometer (Sciex). Information data acquisition was acquired upon a survey scan performed in a mass range from 350 m/z up to 1250 m/z in a scan time of 25 ms. Top 15 peaks were selected for fragmentation. Minimum accumulation time for MS/MS was set to 200 ms giving a total cycle time of 3,3 s. Product ions were scanned in a mass range from 100 m/z up to 1500 m/z and excluded for further fragmentation during 15 s. The raw MS/MS spectra searches were processed using the MaxQuant software (v 1.6.7.0) and searched against the Uniprot proteome reference for Homo sapiens (Proteome ID: UP000005640_9606, February 2019). The parameters used were as follows: initial maximum precursor (15 ppm) fragment mass deviations (20 ppm); fixed modification (Carbamidomethyl (C)); variable modification (Oxidation (M); Acetyl (Protein N-terminal; Deamidation (N); Gln>puroGlu; Phospho (STY)); enzyme (trypsin) with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage; minimum peptide length (7 aminoacids); and false discovery rate (FDR) for PSM and protein identification (1%). Frequently observed laboratory contaminants were removed. The Perseus software (version 1.5.6.0) was used for statistical analysis and data visualization.

### Data Protocol
SWATH-MS: For protein expression analysis, 2 independent pools of aliquots of all samples from EC and FC specimens were used as input for the generation of the SWATH-MS assay library. To increment the proteome coverage, in-solution and in-gel digestion workflows were applied. In the first one, protein material from each pooled sample was precipitated using methanol/chloroform extraction. Pellet was dissolved in 6 M urea, 100mM Tris, pH 7.8. Protein digestion was performed as described above.The digestion mixture was dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted with 110 µL 5mM amonnium formate pH 10, and injected to an ÄKTA pure 25 system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with a high pH stable X-Terra RP18 column (C18; 1 mm × 150 mm; 5 μm) (Waters). Peptides were eluted with a mobile phase B (5mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN at pH 10) of 30-70% linear gradient over 45 min (A, 5mM ammonium formate in water at pH 10; B, 5mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN at pH 10). The UV signal was monitored at 215nm. Fractions were collected and evaporated under vacuum. Neighboring fractions with the low signal intensity were subsequently pooled to generate fractions with similar peptide content. For the second digestion protocol, protein extracts (20 ug) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 1,5 mm thick polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. Total gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 12 equals slides from each pooled sample were excised from the gel and transferred into 1.5mL Eppendorf LoBind tubes. Protein enzymatic cleavage was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko et al., 2006). Purification and concentration of peptides were performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). The peptides recovered from in-gel and in-solution digestion processing were reconstituted into a final concentration of 0.5µg/µL of 2% ACN, 0.5% FA, 97.5% MilliQ-water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. MS/MS datasets for spectral library generation were acquired on a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (Sciex) interfaced to the Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump system (Sciex) as previously described. MS/MS data acquisition was performed using AnalystTF 1.7 (Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through ProteinPilot v5.0 search engine (Sciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) (Shilov et al., 2007) for database search. To avoid using the same spectral evidence in more than one protein, the identified proteins were grouped based on MS/MS spectra by the Progroup™ Algorithm, regardless of the peptide sequence assigned. False discovery rate (FDR) was performed using a non-lineal fitting method (Tang et al, 2008) and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global FDR or better. Then, individual protein extracts from all sample sets (n=40) were subjected to in-solution digestion, peptide purification and reconstitution prior to mass spectrometric analysis as previously mentioned. For SWATH-MS-based experiments the TripleTOF 5600+ instrument was configured as described by Gillet et al (2012). Using an isolation width of 16Da (15Da of optimal ion transmission efficiency and 1Da for the window overlap), a set of 37 overlapping windows was constructed covering the mass range 450–1000 Da. In this way, 1μL of each sample was loaded onto an Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 trap column (0.1x20 mm, particle size 5 µm; ThermoFisher) and desalted with 100% water 0.1% formic acid at 2μL/min during 10 min. The peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 column (0.075x250 mm, particle size 3µm; ThermoFisher) equilibrated in 2% acetonitrile 0.1% FA. Peptide elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 2 to 40% B in 120 min (mobile phases A:100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) and B: 100% acetonitrile 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300nL/min. Eluted peptides were infused in the mass-spectrometer. The Triple TOF was operated in SWATH mode, in which a 0.050s TOF MS scan from 350 to 1250m/z was performed, followed by 0.080s product ion scans from 230 to 1800 m/z on the 37 defined windows (3.05s/cycle). Collision energy was set to optimum energy for a 2 + ion at the center of each SWATH block with a 15 eV collision energy spread. The resulting ProteinPilot group file from library generation was loaded into PeakView® (v2.1, Sciex) and peaks from SWATH runs were extracted with a peptide confidence threshold of 99% confidence (Unused Score ≥ 1.3) and FDR lower than 1%. For this, the MS/MS spectra of the assigned peptides were extracted by ProteinPilot, and only the proteins that fulfilled the following criteria were validated: (1) peptide mass tolerance lower than 10ppm, (2) 99% of confidence level in peptide identification, and (3) complete b/y ions series found in the MS/MS spectrum.  Only proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides were considered.

### Publication Abstract
Tau hyperphosphorylation is the first step of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. In the present study, samples of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and frontal cortex area 8 (FC) of cases with NFT pathology classified as stages I-II, III-IV, and V-VI without comorbidities, and of middle-aged (MA) individuals with no NFT pathology, were analyzed by conventional label-free and SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry) to assess the (phospho)proteomes. The total number of identified dysregulated phosphoproteins was 214 in the EC, 65 of which were dysregulated at the first stages (I-II) of NFT pathology; 167 phosphoproteins were dysregulated in the FC, 81 of them at stages I-II of NFT pathology. A large percentage of dysregulated phosphoproteins were identified in the two regions and at different stages of NFT progression. The main group of dysregulated phosphoproteins was made up of components of the membranes, cytoskeleton, synapses, proteins linked to membrane transport and ion channels, and kinases. The present results show abnormal phosphorylation of proteins at the first stages of NFT pathology in the elderly (in individuals clinically considered representative of normal aging) and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Dysregulated protein phosphorylation in the FC precedes the formation of NFTs and SPs. The most active period of dysregulated phosphorylation is at stages III-IV when a subpopulation of individuals might be clinically categorized as suffering from mild cognitive impairment which is a preceding determinant stage in the progression to dementia. Altered phosphorylation of selected proteins, carried out by activation of several kinases, may alter membrane and cytoskeletal functions, among them synaptic transmission and membrane/cytoskeleton signaling. Besides their implications in sAD, the present observations suggest a molecular substrate for "benign" cognitive deterioration in "normal" brain aging.
