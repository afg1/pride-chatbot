### Title
Astrocyte and neuron subcompartment proteomes reveal distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms of OCD

### Description
Astrocytes and neurons coexist and interact in the CNS1,2. Given that many signaling and pathological events are protein-driven, identifying astrocyte and neuron proteomes is essential for elucidating the complex protein networks that dictate their respective contributions to physiology and disease. Here, we used cell- and subcompartment-specific proximity-dependent biotinylation3 to study the proteomes of striatal astrocytes and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in vivo. We evaluated cytosolic and plasma membrane compartments for astrocytes and MSNs, revealing how these cells differ at the protein level and in their core signaling machinery. We assessed subcellular compartments of astrocytes including end feet and processes to reveal the molecular basis of essential astrocyte signaling and homeostatic functions. Unexpectedly, SAPAP3 proteins (gene; Dlgap3) associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and repetitive behaviors4-11 were detected at equivalent levels in striatal astrocyte and MSN plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments. Astrocytic expression was confirmed by RNA-seq, fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, genetic rescue experiments combined with behavioral analyses and proteomics in a mouse model4 of OCD lacking SAPAP3 revealed contributions of SAPAP3 in astrocytes and MSNs to repetitive and anxiety-related OCD behaviors. Our data define how astrocytes and neurons differ at the protein level and in their major signaling pathways, how astrocyte proteomes vary between physiological subcompartments, and how specific astrocyte and neuronal molecular mechanisms contribute to a psychiatric disease. Targeting both astrocytes and neurons together is likely to be therapeutically effective in complex CNS disorders.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were subjected to reduction using 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine for 30 min, alkylated by 10 mM iodoacetamide for another 30 min, and then digested sequentially with Lys-C and trypsin at a 1:100 protease-to-peptide ratio for 4 and 12 hours, respectively. The digestion reaction was terminated by the addition of formic acid to 5% (vol/vol) with centrifugation. Each sample was then desalted with C18 tips (Thermo Scientific, 87784) and dried in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. The peptide pellet was reconstituted in 5% formic acid before analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
The spectra were collected using data dependent acquisition on Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an MS1 resolution  of 120,000 followed by sequential MS2 scans at a resolution  of 15,000. Data generated by LC-MS/MS were searched  using the Andromeda search engine integrated into the MaxQuant (Cox et al,. 2008) bioinformatic pipelines against the Uniprot  Mus musculus reference proteome (UP000000589 9606) and then filtered using a “decoy” database-estimated false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was carried out by integrating the total extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) of peptide precursor ions from the MS1 scan. These LFQ intensity values were used for protein quantification across samples. Statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins was done using Bioconductor package limma.
