### Title
Clinical and immunological benefits of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19: insights from a single center open label randomised control trial

### Description
A randomised control trial was done to assess clinical and immunological benefits of passive immunization using convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), compared with standard of care, in severe COVID-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Plasma abundance of a large panel of cytokines was quantitated before and after intervention to assess the effect of CPT on the systemic hyper-inflammation encountered in these patients. Transfused convalescent plasma was characterized in terms of its neutralizing antibody content as well as proteome. While across all age-groups clinical outcomes were not significantly different, significant immediate mitigation of hypoxia, reduction in hospital stay as well as significant survival benefit were registered in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS aged less than 67 years receiving CPT. In addition to its neutralizing antibody content, a significant effect of the anti-inflammatory proteome of convalescent plasma on attenuation of systemic cytokine deluge, contributed to the clinical benefits of CPT.

### Sample Protocol
From each sample, 10 µl of plasma was taken in a fresh 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and diluted to 100 µl with phosphate buffer (1X PBS). Rapid protein precipitation was performed for these samples by addition of 400 µl of acetone and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes followed by centrifugation at 10000 g for 5 minutes (as described by https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00867). After removal of supernatant, pellets were air dried and suspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Protein estimation was performed for each samples using the Bradford assay (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). For proteomics analysis, 20 µg of protein from each sample was reduced by addition of 25 mM of dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 56 degrees Celsius for 25 minutes. Cysteine alkylation was performed by addition of 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated in dark for 20 minutes. Samples were subjected to trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) digestion at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:10 for 18 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Reaction was terminated by addition of 0.1% formic acid and dried under vacuum. Peptide cleanup was performed using Oasis HLB 1cc Vac cartridge (Waters). DIA-SWATH analysis for samples were performed on a quadrupole-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer (TripleTOF 6600, Sciex, USA) coupled to a nano-LC system (Eksigent NanoLC-425). For each sample, 4 μg of these peptides were loaded on a trap-column (ChromXP C18CL 5 μm 120 Å, Eksigent) where desalting was performed using 0.1% formic acid in water with a flow rate of 10 μl per minutes for10 min. Peptides were then separated on a reverse-phase C18analytical column (ChromXP C18, 3 μm 120 Å, Eksigent) in a 57 minutes gradient of buffer A (0.1%formic acid in water) and buffer B (0.1% formic in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute. A method with 100 precursor isolation windows were defined based on precursor m/z frequencies using the SWATH Variable Window Calculator (Sciex), with a minimum window of 5 m/z. The accumulation time was set to 250 msec for the MS scan (400–1250 m/z) and 25 msec for the MS/MS scans (100–1500 m/z). Rolling collision energies were applied for each window based on the m/z range of each SWATH and a charge 2+ ion, with a collision energy spread of five. The total cycle time was 2.8 sec.

### Data Protocol
SWATH data was processed using the SWATH Acquisition MicroApp 2.0.1 in PeakView 2.2 Software. An in-house protein spectral-ion library file (.group) for plasma samples generated using Proteinpilot v5.0.1 software was imported with specified maximum 251 proteins and shared peptides were excluded. SWATH run files were added and retention time alignment was performed using peptides from abundant proteins. The processing settings for peak extraction were: at least 10 peptides per protein, 5 transitions per peptide, >95% peptide confidence threshold, 1 %FDR. XIC extraction window was set to 55 min with 75 ppm XIC Width. All information was exported in the form of MarkerView (.mrkw) files. In MarkerView1.2.1, data normalisation was performed using total area sum normalisation and exported to an Excel file for further analysis.

### Publication Abstract
A single center open label phase 2 randomised control trial (Clinical Trial Registry of India No. CTRI/2020/05/025209) was done to assess clinical and immunological benefits of passive immunization using convalescent plasma therapy. At the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital in Kolkata, India, 80 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease and fulfilling the inclusion criteria (aged more than 18 years, with either mild ARDS having PaO2/FiO2 200-300 or moderate ARDS having PaO2/FiO2 100-200, not on mechanical ventilation) were recruited and randomized into either standard of care (SOC) arm (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) or the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) arm (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;40). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality by day 30 of enrolment and immunological correlates of response to therapy if any, for which plasma abundance of a large panel of cytokines was quantitated before and after intervention to assess the effect of CPT on the systemic hyper-inflammation encountered in these patients. The secondary outcomes were recovery from ARDS and time taken to negative viral RNA PCR as well as to report any adverse reaction to plasma therapy. Transfused convalescent plasma was characterized in terms of its neutralizing antibody content as well as proteome. The trial was completed and it was found that primary outcome of all-cause mortality was not significantly different among severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS randomized to two treatment arms (Mantel-Haenszel Hazard Ratio 0.6731, 95% confidence interval 0.3010-1.505, with a P value of 0.3424 on Mantel-Cox Log-rank test). No adverse effect was reported with CPT. In severe COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate ARDS no significant clinical benefit was registered in this clinical trial with convalescent plasma therapy in terms of prespecified outcomes.
