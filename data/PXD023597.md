### Title
Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins interacting with cGAS

### Description
o identify the potential associated proteins of cGAS, we performed co-IP followed by mass spectrometry  analysis in HEK293A cells stably expressing SFB-tagged cGAS.

### Sample Protocol
Whole-cell lysates were prepared from SFB-tagged cGAS or control vector expressing HEK293A cells. The cell lysates were subjected to IP with S-protein agarose (Millipore).Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The entire lane was cut into 2-mm gel slices, digested with Trypsin, and subjected to LC-MS/MS assays using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Thermo Proteome Discovery (version 2.3), and tandem mass spectra were searched against the UniProt-Homo sapiens database.
