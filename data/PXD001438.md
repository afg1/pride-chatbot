### Title
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

### Description
Quantitative (iTRAQ 4-plex) proteomic analysis of progressive head and neck cancers

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from individual biopsies (normal lip, dysplastic tongue, non-metastatic tongue and metastatic tongue) using a double lysis method. Protein amount was determined and equal amount treated in parallel

### Data Protocol
Proteins were extracted from individual biopsies (normal lip, dysplastic tongue, non-metastatic tongue and metastatic tongue) using a double lysis method. Protein amount was determined and equal amounts of each treated in parallel, reduction, alkylation, trypsin digestion and then treatment with one of 4 iTRAQ reagents. The labelled digests were combined, subject to SCX separation into 12 fractions. Each fraction was analysed in duplicate by LC MALDI MS/MS.
