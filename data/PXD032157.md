### Title
A male-specific steroid hormone controls female reproductive biology in the malaria mosquito

### Description
Insects, unlike vertebrates, are generally believed to lack steroid hormones with functions predominantly associated with adult male biology. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) appears to both control egg development in females and induce mating refractoriness and oviposition when sexually transferred by males. Here we show that these sex-specific functions are instead carried out by distinct steroids. We identify a male-specific oxidized form of 20E (3D20E) that upon sexual transfer switches off female mating receptivity, ensuring male paternity. Endogenous female 20E does not induce mating refractoriness, while it triggers oviposition in mated females when expression of a 20E-inhibiting kinase is repressed. 3D20E and 20E have different downstream targets, with 3D20E inducing expression of a tolerance factor that preserves female fitness during Plasmodium infection. The evolution of this male steroid has therefore not only shaped the mating biology of An. gambiae, but also impacted malaria transmission.

### Sample Protocol
15N-labeled virgin females (4–6 days old) were forced mated to age-matched unlabeled virgin males. Successful mating was verified by confirming the presence of a mating plug under a microscope. At 3, 12 and 24 hpm, the atrium of 45–55 mated females was dissected into ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8), and homogenized with a pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was combined with 50 µl of 0.1% RapiGest in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Supernatant and pellet from each sample were snap-frozen on dry ice and shipped overnight to the MacCoss Lab at the University of Washington, where sample preparation for LC-MS/MS was completed. Pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of 0.1% RapiGest in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate and sonicated in a water bath. Protein concentration was measured for both pellets and supernatants with BCA assay and samples were reduced with 5 mM DTT, alkylated with 15mM IAA (Iodoacetamide) and digested with trypsin for one hour at 37°C (1:50 trypsin:substrate ratio). RapiGest was cleaved with the addition of 200mM HCl, followed by a 45 minute incubation at 37°C and a 14,000 rpm centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove debris. Samples were cleaned by dual-mode solid-phase extraction and resuspended in 0.1% of formic acid at a final protein concentration of 0.33 µg/µl. Two analytical replicates were analyzed for each sample. One ug of each sample digest was analyzed using a 25 cm fused silica 75 μm column and a 4 cm fused silica Kasil frit trap loaded with Jupiter C12 reverse phase resin with a 180-min LC-MS/MS run on a Thermo Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer coupled with a Waters nanoACQUITY.

### Data Protocol
Data-Dependent Acquition (DDA) data generated from each run was converted to mzML format using Proteowizard and searched using Comet (version 3.2) against a FASTA database containing protein sequences from An. gambiae (VectorBase, release 54), An. ColuzziMali-NIH (VectorBase, release 54), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Uniprot, March 2021), three-frame translations of An. gambiae RNAseq and known human contaminants. Peptide-spectrum match false discovery rates were determined using Percolator (version 3.05) at a threshold of 0.01, and peptides were assembled into protein identifications using protein parsimony in Limelight. Relative protein abundance was estimated using a normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) calculated for each protein within each run.
