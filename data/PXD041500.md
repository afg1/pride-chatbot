### Title
Phosphoproteome of SHVV-infection CCO cell

### Description
SHVV-infected CCO cells at 24 h post infection and mock CCO cells were used for 4D label-free phosphoproteome sequencing to identify phosphorylated sites on proteins of SHV.

### Sample Protocol
Sample was sonicated three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz) in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). (Note: For PTM experiments, inhibitors were also added to the lysis buffer, e.g. 3 μM TSA and 50 mM NAM for acetylation.) The remaining debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined with BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For digestion, the protein solution was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in darkness. The protein sample was then diluted by adding 100 mM TEAB to urea concentration less than 2M. Finally, trypsin was added at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion. After trypsin digestion, peptide was desalted by Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenomenex) and vacuum-dried. Peptide was reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT kit/iTRAQ kit. Briefly, one unit of TMT/iTRAQ reagent were thawed and reconstituted in acetonitrile. The peptide mixtures were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and pooled, desalted and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The tryptic peptides were fractionated into fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC using Thermo Betasil C18 column (5 μm particles, 10 mm ID, 250 mm length). Briefly, peptides were first separated with a gradient of 8% to 32% acetonitrile (pH 9.0) over 60 min into 60 fractions. Then, the peptides were combined into 6 fractions and dried by vacuum centrifuging. Pan antibody-based PTM enrichment:  To enrich modified peptides, tryptic peptides dissolved in NETN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% NP-40, pH 8.0) were incubated with pre-washed antibody beads (Lot number 001, PTM Bio) at 4°C overnight with gentle shaking. Then the beads were washed four times with NETN buffer and twice with H2O. The bound peptides were eluted from the beads with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the eluted fractions were combined and vacuum-dried. For LC-MS/MS analysis, the resulting peptides were desalted with C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bio-material-based PTM enrichment (for phosphorylation):  Peptide mixtures were first incubated with IMAC microspheres suspension with vibration in loading buffer (50% acetonitrile/6% trifluoroacetic acid). The IMAC microspheres with enriched phosphopeptides were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. To remove nonspecifically adsorbed peptides, the IMAC microspheres were washed with 50% acetonitrile/6% trifluoroacetic acid and 30% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, sequentially. To elute the enriched phosphopeptides from the IMAC microspheres, elution buffer containing 10% NH4OH was added and the enriched phosphopeptides were eluted with vibration. The supernatant containing phosphopeptides was collected and lyophilized for LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy database. Trypsin/P was specified as cleavage enzyme allowing up to 4 missing cleavages. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set as 20 ppm in First search and 5 ppm in Main search, and the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set as 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as fixed modification and acetylation modification and oxidation on Met were specified as variable modifications. FDR was adjusted to < 1% and minimum score for modified peptides was set > 40.

### Publication Abstract
Phosphoprotein (P), co-factor of the polymerase (large protein, L) of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses, is phosphorylated during viral infection and its phosphorylation has been reported to play important roles in viral replication. However, the function of P phosphorylation in viral replication is still far from clear. Snakehead vesiculovirus (SHVV) is a kind of fish rhabdovirus that has caused serious economic losses in snakehead fish culture in China without any effective preventive or therapeutical measures currently. In this study, 4D label-free phosphoproteomics sequencing of SHVV-infected cells identified five phosphorylated sites on SHVV P, among which threonine 160 (T160) was proved to be phosphorylated. Overexpression of wild-type P, but not P-T160A or P-T160E mutant, promoted SHVV replication, suggesting that the T160 phosphorylation on the P protein is critical for SHVV replication. Moreover, we found that T160A or T160E mutation on SHVV P had no effect on the interactions of P-nucleoprotein (N), P-P, or P-L. Further study revealed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) interacted with SHVV P and mediated the T160 phosphorylation. Besides, overexpression of p38MAPK or GSK3 facilitated, while knockdown or activity inhibition of p38MAPK or GSK3 suppressed, SHVV replication. Overall, p38MAPK- and GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the P protein at T160 is required for SHVV replication, which provided targets for designing anti-SHVV drugs and developing live-attenuated SHVV vaccines. Our study helps understand the role of P phosphorylation in the replication of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Phosphorylation of viral proteins plays important roles in viral replication. Currently, the role of phosphorylation of phosphoprotein (P) in the replication of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses is far from clear. Identification of the phosphorylated sites on viral P protein and the related host kinases is helpful for developing live-attenuated vaccines and designing antiviral drugs. This study focused on identifying the phosphorylated sites on P protein of a fish rhabdovirus SHVV, determining the related host kinases, and revealing the effects of the phosphorylated sites and kinases on SHVV replication. We found that SHVV P was phosphorylated at T160, which was mediated by the kinases p38MAPK and GSK3 to promote SHVV replication. This study is the first time to study the role of P phosphorylation in fish rhabdovirus replication.
