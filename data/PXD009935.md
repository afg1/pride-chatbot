### Title
Determinants of the cellular immunopeptidome -cellular peptidome

### Description
Mass spectrometry analysis of the immunopeptidome after TNF/IFN stimulation

### Sample Protocol
HLA bound peptides were eluted and subjected to MS/MS analysis on a QE instrument

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.0.16) with the default parameters for the analysis of proteins and peptides (LFQ) minimum ratio count of 1, minimum peptide length for unspecific search of 8, maximum peptide length for unspecific search of 25, peptide FDR was set to 0.01 and match between runs enabled. Masses were searched against the human proteome database from UniprotKB
