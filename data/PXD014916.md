### Title
Proteomic responses of Candida glabrata to acetate as the sole carbon source

### Description
The responses of Candida glabrata grown in acetate-containing growth medium was investigated by label-free quantitative proteomic analysis using the liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from Candida glabrata cells grown in acetate-containing growth medium. Subsequently, proteins were quantified and subjected to in-solution digestion. A nano-flow ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) instrument (EASY-nLC 1200 System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled online to a Q Exactive Plus Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with a Nanospray Flex ion source was used for analysis.

### Data Protocol
Data qcquisition was executed with the Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using the integrated SEQUEST search engine against the Candida UniProt protein database. All peptide spectrums  were further validated with Percolator algorithm.
