### Title
Phosphoproteome of filamentous fungus  Aspergillus nidulans

### Description
We describe thephosphoproteome of filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Phosphopeptides were enriched using affinity enrichment using titanium dioxide and  separated using  a convenient ultralong gradient separations on c18 reverse phase columns. Over 1637 phosphopeptides corresponding to 647 phosphoproteins were identified using using a “high-high” strategy using HCD on the novel Q-exactive platform

### Sample Protocol
A.nidulans  strain A1166 was grown in shake flasks containing 1.2 L complex growth medium (MAGUU) until mid-exponential phase. Following this mycelia were harnessed, and used for protein extraction. Extracted proteins were quantified using BCA assay and digested using trypsin. Trypsinized peptides obtained from 2mg proteins were enriched for phosphopeptides using TiO2 resins, . Phosphopeptides were identified using ultralong reverse phase gradients on a UHPLC instrument coupled to the Q-Exactive.

### Data Protocol
In order to identify phosphopeptides from obtained spectra, we performed a combinatorial database search against A.nidulans database available online (http://www.uniprot.org). Data obtained from duplicate runs were pooled together and analyzed using Sequest on Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.3, Peaks DB and OMSSA on PEAKS 6. Results from these searches were exported, and visualized together using inChorus module on PEAKS 6.

### Publication Abstract
We describe the first phosphoproteome of the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Phosphopeptides were enriched using titanium dioxide, separated using a convenient ultra-long reverse phase gradient, and identified using a "high-high" strategy (high mass accuracy on the parent and fragment ions) with higher-energy collisional dissociation. Using this approach 1801 phosphosites, from 1637 unique phosphopeptides, were identified. Functional classification revealed phosphoproteins were overrepresented under GO categories related to fungal morphogenesis: "sites of polar growth," "vesicle mediated transport," and "cytoskeleton organization." In these same GO categories, kinase-substrate analysis of phosphoproteins revealed the majority were target substrates of CDK and CK2 kinase families, indicating these kinase families play a prominent role in fungal morphogenesis. Kinase-substrate analysis also identified 57 substrates for kinases known to regulate secretion of hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. PkaA, SchA, and An-Snf1). Altogether this data will serve as a benchmark that can be used to elucidate regulatory networks functionally associated with fungal morphogenesis and secretion. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000715 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000715).
