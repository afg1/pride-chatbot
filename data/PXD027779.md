### Title
Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis in chronically MTOR-deficient clones

### Description
Shotgun-proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of clonal pancreatic tumor cell lines upon long-term ablation of the energy master kinase regualator mTOR

### Sample Protocol
label-free sample prep; in solution digestion of 200µg protein as starting material; phosphoenrichement prep based on TiO2 beads; 5µg peptides desaplted for proteome analysis from the same sample before phosphoenrichment

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (version 1.6.13) with integrated Andromeda search engine was used for proteome and phosphoproteome raw data files processing to calculate LFQ intensities and phosphopeptide intensities, respectively (FDR < 0.01 at both the protein and peptide levels was used); Perseus platform (version 1.6.10.50) was used for post-processing data analysis; R environment (version 4.0.2) was used for data visualization
