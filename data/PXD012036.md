### Title
ROCK1 inhibition reduces steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease

### Description
To identify kinases in immune cells of patients with SR-GVHD we isolated leukocytes and specifically enriched kinases via kinet-beads-technology. Rho Kinase Type 1 (ROCK1) was identified as the most abundant kinase in SR-GVHD.

### Sample Protocol
Kinases were enriched and eluted from beads in SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, 7 slices per sample. Trypsin in-gel digestion of eluates was performed followed by shot-gun bottom-up proteomics analyses.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant 1.4.1.2 search of label-free proteomics data

### Publication Abstract
