### Title
Response Profiling Using Shotgun Proteomics Enables Establishing Global Metallodrug Mechanisms of Action - cytoplasmic proteins of KP46-treated HCT 116 epithelial cells

### Description
Response profiling using shotgun proteomics for establishing global metallodrug mechanisms of action in two colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, was applied and evaluated with the clinically approved arsenic trioxide.  Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.

### Data Protocol
Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification. Protein identification was achieved searching against the SwissProt Database (version August 2014 with 20 194 entries) allowing a mass tolerance of 10ppm for MS spectra and 50mmu for MS/MS spectra as well as a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Furthermore, search criteria included carbamidomethylation on cysteins as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as well as N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modifications.

### Publication Abstract
Response profiling using shotgun proteomics for establishing global metallodrug mechanisms of action in two colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 and SW480, has been applied and evaluated with the clinically approved arsenic trioxide. Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80&#x2009;% convergence of protein identification, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem to affect the extent of protein regulation. A clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon treatment with arsenic, but hardly in HCT116 cells. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anti-cancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537). Proteome alterations were mapped to selected functional groups, including DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. The present data suggest that knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti-cancer metallodrugs and improved patient stratification strategies are imperative for the design of clinical studies.
