### Title
Yeast Phospho QTL (resubmission)

### Description
Rachel Brem's QTL yeast strain collection (BY4716 x S288C cross) profiled by full lysate and phospho-enrichment proteomic analysis

### Sample Protocol
Yeast strains were grown in SD medium to OD 0.8; proteins were extracted by bead beating in 8M urea/AmBic and reduced/alkylated by TCEP/IAA; digestion was performed with trypsin and peptides were C18 cleaned up ("non-enriched" samples); peptides were phospho-enriched on TiO2/Phthalic acid and C18 cleaned up ("phospho-enriched" samples); data were acquired in DDA or SWATH mode on TripleTOF 5600 using 2hrs gradient

### Data Protocol
DDA files were searched with Comet and Mascot; search results were combined with iProphet and converted to spectral library using spectraST. Transition list included the 5 most intense fragments for each precursor. SWATH files were extracted with openSWATH and re-aligned with TRIC; phospho-peptides were controled for the number of peak clusters detectable per file; final peptide and protein matrices were generated by mapDIA
