### Title
Lymnaea shell proteomics -  Molecular modularity and asymmetry of the molluscan mantle revealed by a gene expression atlas

### Description
The calcifying matrix proteins embedded within the shell biomineral structure is a mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides that are involved in the shell formation processes. Here with develop bottom-up shotgun proteomic investigation of these proteins, thanks to specific transcriptomic data generated from the calcifying mantle of adult Lymnaea.

### Sample Protocol
The acid-soluble and the acid-insoluble matrix proteins were extracted from adult shells, then reduced, alkyled and digested with trysin prior to nanoLC-ESI MS/MS analysis on a QSTAR (Sciex) coupled to a Dionex U3000 HPLC.

### Data Protocol
MFG file was then generated from wiff raw data using Anatyst 1.1 software, then data were analyzed using Mascot serach engine 2.4, against an in-house transcriptomic database.
