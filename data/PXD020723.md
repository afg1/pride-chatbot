### Title
Influenza viral RNA pulldown MS in THP-1 cells

### Description
Due to the RNA nature of their genomes, influenza viruses have to utilize many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) of both viral and host origin, for their replication. To uncover the comprehensive vRNA-host protein interactions, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis of influenza vRNA complexes. The eight vRNA segments of H7N9 were transcribed and individually labeled with biotin in vitro and incubated with IAV virus-infected THP-1 cells, and vRNA complexes were enriched streptavidin magnetic beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry

### Sample Protocol
THP-1 cells were treated with PMA for 12h. And then, cells were infected with H7N9 virus. After 12h infection, cells were collected and lysed with NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40). Cell lysates were mixed with transcribed biotin-tagged viral RNA for 4 h at 4°C and incubated with pre-washed dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (sigma) for another 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with NT2 buffer and the protein samples bound to the beads were boiled with immunoblot loading buffer at 100°C for 10min and analyzed by LC-MS.

### Data Protocol
Domain enrichment analysis of these co-purifying proteins for each bait revealed predictable associations, and more than 90% of which harbor nucleic acid binding domains
