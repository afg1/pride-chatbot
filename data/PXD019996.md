### Title
In-column thermostability of peptides

### Description
The primary objective of this study was to revise the advantages of temperature in peptide separations using state-of-the-art columns, but more importantly, to reveal possible mechanisms elevated temperature can impair proteomic bottom-up LC-MS analyses.

### Sample Protocol
A bacterial (F. tularensis live vaccine strain) cell lysate as a medium complexity proteomic sample and a eukaryotic (Jurkat cells) cell lysate as a higher complexity proteomic sample were prepared. Proteins dissolved in sodium deoxycholate were reduced using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and thiols were blocked using S-methyl methanethiosulfonate or iodoacetamide. Sequencing-grade trypsin was added in 1:50 ratio, and the proteins were digested at 37 ˚C overnight. The digests were acidified with TFA, and the precipitated deoxycholic acid was pelleted. Supernatant was desalted using two Oasis HLB 1cc 30 mg extraction cartridges. LC–MS analyses were carried out using a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system hyphenated to a Q Exactive HF–X mass spectrometer. Mobile phase A and B was water and acetonitrile, respectively, both acidified with 0.1% formic acid. Tryptic peptides were separated using a gradient of mobile phase B. The particular gradient and the DDA settings reflected the analyzed sample and the purpose of the particular experiment.

### Data Protocol
The LC–MS data were searched in Byonic v3.5, either stand-alone or fully implemented in Proteome Discoverer v2.3 against F. tularensis subsp. holarctica protein database or Human protein database, both downloaded from UniProt. For the search of the LC-MS data obtained from the Jurkat cells, the mass tolerance was set at 7.5 ppm for precursors and at 20 ppm for fragments. Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as fixed modification. Full tryptic specificity was used, and oxidized Met and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as dynamic modifications for a conventional LC-MS data search. The trypsin specificity was changed to semitryptic, and also pyroglutamate formation from N-terminal Glu and Gln, dehydration of Asp, and deamination of Asn were set as dynamic modifications besides those considered in the conventional search for a search. Only peptide-spectrum matches identified with a 2D FDR ≤ 1% were taken into consideration.

### Publication Abstract
Elevated column temperature represents a simple means for improving chromatographic separation of peptides. Here, we demonstrated the advantages of the column temperature in peptide separation using state-of-the-art columns. More importantly, we also determined how temperature can impair proteomic bottom-up analyses. We found that an elevated temperature in combination with the acidic pH of the mobile phase induced in-column peptide hydrolysis with high specificity to Asp and accelerated five modification reactions of amino acids. The positive effects of temperature dominated in the 30 min long gradients since the column operated at 90 &#xb0;C provided the largest number of identified peptides and proteins. However, the adverse effects of temperature on peptide integrity in longer liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses required its reduction to obtain optimum results. The largest number of peptides was identified using the column maintained at 75 &#xb0;C in 60 min long gradients, at 60 &#xb0;C in 120 min long gradients, and at 45 &#xb0;C in 240 min long gradients. Our results indicate that no universal column temperature exists for bottom-up LC-MS analyses. Quite the contrary, the temperature setting must be selected rationally to exploit the full capabilities of the state-of-the-art mass spectrometers in proteomic LC-MS analyses, with the gradient time being a critical factor.
