### Title
In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics - PXD000603 UniProt proteome with isoforms analysis

### Description
This dataset is no actual new study but the results of the benchmark against the PXD000603 used in the manuscript "In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics".

### Sample Protocol
For the complete sample processing, please see the dataset PXD000603.

### Data Protocol
The 12 lung cancer (LC1-LC12) samples of the PXD000603 were used. For the peptide identification a precursor tolerance of 10 ppm, a fragment tolerance of 0.8 Da, two missed cleavages and the variable modifications for oxidation of M were allowed, for the fixed modifications Carbamidomethylation of C was set.
