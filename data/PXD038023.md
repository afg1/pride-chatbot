### Title
High throughput chemogenetic drug screening reveals therapeutic vulnerabilities in the signaling circuitries underlying GNAQ-mutant uveal melanoma

### Description
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most prevalent cancer of the eye in adults, with a highly aggressive form of metastasis that is refractory to current therapies. UM is driven by aberrant activation of the Gαq pathway by hotspot activating mutation of GNAQ/GNA11, with few additional genetic aberrations. Despite this, there are limited effective targeted therapies currently available against the treatment of UM and mUM. Here, we performed a high-throughput chemogenetic drug screen in GNAQ-mutant UM contrasted with that of BRAF-mutant skin cutaneous melanoma, as a network chemical biology-based approach to identify therapeutic agents that target the mechanistic underpinnings driving UM. We observed strong genotype-driven drug sensitivities, and identified several drug classes with preferential activity against UM using a method termed Drug Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA). Among them, we found an enrichment for PKC inhibitors, and identified one compound LXS-196, with the highest preferential activity against UM. Our investigation into the mechanism of action of LXS-196 revealed that in addition to inhibiting the Gq-ERK pathway, unlike other PKC inhibitors, this drug also reduced FAK activity, a recently identified mediator of non-canonical Gαq-driven oncogenic signaling. Kinome profiling revealed that LXS-196 acts as a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, with high preference for PKC as well as PKN/PRK, the latter a poorly investigated AGC kinase that is activated directly by RhoA. This primes LXS-196 to target cell-essential pathways that drive tumor growth in UM by targeting both PKC, in addition to FAK. Moreover, we find that PKN is activated by GNAQ downstream from RhoA, thereby contributing to FAK stimulation. These findings expose a signaling vulnerability that can be targeted pharmacologically. Ultimately, dual PKC and PKN inhibition by LXS-196 acts synergistically with FAK inhibitors (FAKi) to halt UM growth and promote cytotoxic cell death in vitro and in preclinical metastatic mouse models, thus providing a highly translatable therapeutic multimodal precision strategy against mUM.

### Sample Protocol
Cells were lysed with 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, complete mini EDTA free), 125U Benzonase/mL). Lysates were flash-frozen twice on dry ice for 5-10 min, followed by a 30-45 s thaw in 37oC water bath with agitation. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13000 x g for 15 min at 4oC.  For FLAG purification, 30 μL of bead slurry (Anti-Flag M2 Magnetic Beads, Sigma) was washed twice with 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and the lysate was incubated with the anti-FLAG beads at 4oC with agitation for 2 hrs on a KingFisher Flex. After incubation, flow-through was removed and beads were washed once with 1 mL of wash buffer with 0.05% NP40 and twice with 1 mL of wash buffer (no NP40). Bound proteins were eluted by incubating beads with 30 μL of 100 ug/ml 3xFLAG peptide in 0.05% RapiGest in wash buffer for 15 min at RT with shaking. Supernatants were removed and elution was repeated with 15 μL. Eluates were combined and 15 μL of 8 M urea, 250 mM Tris, 5 mM DTT (final concentration ~1.7 M urea, 50 mM Tris, and 1 mM DTT) was added to give a final total volume of 50 μL. Samples were incubated at 60oC for 15 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 3 mM and incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. DTT was added to a final concentration of 3 mM before adding 1 μg of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) and incubating at 37oC overnight. Samples were acidified to 0.5% TFA (ph<2) with 10% TFA stock and incubated for 30 min before desalting on C18 stage tip (Rainin).   Samples were then resuspended in 20 μL of MS loading buffer (4% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 2μL were separated by a reversed-phase gradient over a nanoflow 75μm ID x 25cm long picotip column packed with 1.9μM C18 particles (Dr. Maisch). Peptides were directly injected over the course of a 70 min acquisition into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo).

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were searched against the uniprot canonical isoforms of the human proteome (downloaded March 21, 2018) using the default settings in MaxQuant (version 1.6.6.0). Peptides and proteins were filtered to 1% false discovery rate in MaxQuant, and identified proteins were then subjected to protein-protein interaction scoring. Protein spectral counts as determined by MaxQuant search results were used for PPI confidence scoring by SAINTexpress (version 3.6.1), using samples in which Rhoa expression was not induced by addition of doxycycline as controls. The list of PPIs was filtered to those with a SAINTexpress BFDR =< 0.05.

### Publication Abstract
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most prevalent cancer of the eye in adults, driven by activating mutation of GNAQ/GNA11; however, there are limited therapies against UM and metastatic UM (mUM). Here, we perform a high-throughput chemogenetic drug screen in GNAQ-mutant UM contrasted with BRAF-mutant cutaneous melanoma, defining the druggable landscape of these distinct melanoma subtypes. Across all compounds, darovasertib demonstrates the highest preferential activity against UM. Our investigation reveals that darovasertib potently inhibits PKC as well as PKN/PRK, an AGC kinase family that is part of the "dark kinome." We find that downstream of the G&#x3b1;q-RhoA signaling axis, PKN converges with ROCK to control FAK, a mediator of non-canonical G&#x3b1;q-driven signaling. Strikingly, darovasertib synergizes with FAK inhibitors to halt UM growth and promote cytotoxic cell death in&#xa0;vitro and in preclinical metastatic mouse models, thus exposing a signaling vulnerability that can be exploited as a multimodal precision therapy against mUM.
