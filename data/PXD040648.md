### Title
N-terminomics Analysis of Mouse cultured cortical neuron during excitotoxicity

### Description
Excitotoxicity is a primary pathological process directing neuronal cell death in both acute neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. We use mouse cultured cortical neuron treated with 100uM of Glutamate for a model of excitotoxicity and applied N-terminomics (TAILS) method to identify the neuronal proteins aberrantly modified in excitotoxicity

### Sample Protocol
For N-Terminomics (TAILS): The enrichment of protein N-terminal peptides was done by a polymer-based negative selection method. Briefly, cell lysates in RIPA buffer were acetone precipitated then resuspended in 8M GuHCl in 100mM of HEPES (pH 8), and total protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce-Thermo Scientific). 500ug protein from each treatment and replicate were denatured, reduced and alkylated followed by demethylation of primary N-terminal amines and surface exposed lysine(s) using normal and deuterated formaldehyde where sodium cyanoborohydride used as the catalyst. Then individual treatments were combined at a 1:1 ratio and cleaned up by precipitation with chloroform/methanol and resuspended to digest with trypsin (Thermo Fisher) 1:100 (1µg trypsin/100µg protein). To remove the tryptic peptides after digestion, a water-soluble high molecular weight dendritic polyglycerol-aldehyde polymer (http://flintbox.com/public/project/1948/) was used at a ratio of 2:1 (2ug polymer/ 1ug peptide). The bound polymer with tryptic peptide was then removed by filtration with a spin filter device (10 kDa MW cut-off, Millipore) and thus negatively select either naturally amino modified or di-methylated peptides. Then the peptides were freeze-dried overnight. Enriched N-terminal peptides were then desalted with C18 extraction tip using SDBRP (styrene-divinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonate) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis with a linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo).

### Data Protocol
For N-terminomics (TAILS): The MS/MS raw data were converted to mxXML and spectra were matched to peptide sequences in mouse protein database (SwissProt TaxID=10090) (v2017-10-25 using Andromeda search engine, Maxquant version 1.5.3.30 The search parameters included Arg_C_Semi with two missed cleavages as cleavage pattern and the mass tolerance for precursor (MS1) and fragment (MS2) were 20 ppm and 0.05 Da respectively. The modifications include Met oxidation (+15.99492 Da), N-terminal Dimethyl:2H(4) (+32.05641 Da), N-terminal glutamine (Gln→pyro-Glu; -17.02655Da), N-terminal acetylation (+42.01057 Da), Carbamidomethyl (C) (+57.02146 Da), lysine (K) Dimethyl:2H(4) (+32.05641Da).
