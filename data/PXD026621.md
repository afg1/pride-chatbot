### Title
Stimulation of motilin secretion by bile, free fatty acids and acidification in human duodenal organoids

### Description
Characterision of the bioactive peptide content of M-cells. M-cells derived from organoids were sorted using FAC sorting techniques and were lysed and analysed by LC-MS/MS using a peptidomics approach.

### Sample Protocol
Sorted cells were lysed in 6M GuHCl, and extracted using solid phase extraction. Peptides were reduced and alkylated prior to LC-MS/MS analysis on a nano LC system.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using PEAKS 8.5, with fixed carbamidomethlyation modification of cysteine residures, and variable modifications of N-terminal pyroglutamate, N-terminal actylation, methionine oxidation and C-terminal amidation.
