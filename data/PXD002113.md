### Title
C. trachomatis L2 inclusion proteome

### Description
Chlamydia trachomatis is an important human pathogen that replicates inside the infected host cell in a unique vacuole, the inclusion. The formation of this intracellular bacterial niche is essential for productive Chlamydia infections. Despite its importance for Chlamydia biology, a holistic view on the protein composition of the inclusion, including its membrane, is currently missing.  Here we describe a newly established method to purify inclusions from C. trachomatis infected epithelial cells and the analysis of the host cell-derived proteome by a combination of label free and stable isotope labeling -based quantitative proteomics. Computational analysis of the proteome data indicated that the inclusion is a complex intracellular trafficking platform that interacts with host cells' antero- and retrograde trafficking pathways. Furthermore, the inclusion is highly enriched for sorting nexins of the SNX-BAR retromer, a complex essential for retrograde trafficking. Functional studies showed that in particular SNX5 controls the C. trachomatis infection and that retrograde trafficking is essential for infectious progeny formation.  In summary, our findings suggest that the inclusion of C. trachomatis is well embedded in the hosts' endomembrane system and hijacks retrograde trafficking pathways for effective infection.

### Sample Protocol
Three independent replicates were performed. SILAC light labeled HeLa cells infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2 were mixed with the same amount of SILAC heavy labeled mock infected HeLa cells. Total cell lysate samples were taken (Lysate). Inclusions were isolated from the remaining lysate, concentrated and prepared for LC-MS/MS by FASP. 10 % of the sample was used for direct injection after desalting by STAGE tip. The remaining peptides were separated by strong anion exchange chromatography into 6 fractions before desalting by STAGE tip. The total cell lysate samples were not fractionated. Tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo) coupled to a TriVersa NanoMate source (Advion). Ten �l of tryptic peptides were separated with an UltiMate 3000 nHPLC (Dionex). Peptides were ionized by ESI. Approximately 1 �g of peptides were loaded on an Acclaim PepMap 100 precolum (Thermo) (0.75 �m inner diameter, packed with 3 �m C18 particles). Separation by reversed phase chromatography was achieved on a 25 cm Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column (Thermo) with 2 �m C18 particles using a 120 min linear gradient from 2 % to 25 % Buffer A (0.1 % acetic acid, 2 % ACN) in Buffer B (0.1 % acetic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nl/ min. The column was heated to 40 �C. The mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent "top 10" method.

### Data Protocol
Raw data was analyzed with MaxQuant Version 1.3.0.5  in standard settings with the requantify feature enabled using a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1%. Quantification by intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) was enabled, without introduction of external reference peptides (iBAQ logarithmic fit disabled). The human reviewed reference proteome .FASTA file (organism 9606, keyword 1185) and the reference proteome for C. trachomatis serovar L2 (strain 434/Bu / ATCC VR-902B) were retrieved from uniprot.org on September 12, 2012 and concatenated. The .raw files for the lysates (3 .raw files) were processed independently of the .raw files of the fractionated and full inclusion measurements. All six SAX fractions plus the overview fraction of each experiment were treated as a single experiment and analyzed together (21 .raw files). The data obtained from MaxQuant was filtered initially by removing common contaminations included in the common contaminations .FASTA file provided by MaxQuant 1.3.0.5, as well as identifications based solely on proteins from the decoy database (reverse database from .FASTA file). Furthermore only proteins that were found in all three experiments of a triplicate were retained.  For determination of the host cell derived proteome of the inclusion, all bacterial proteins were filtered. Protein groups that had less than two unique+ razor peptides in at least one experiment were filtered.
