### Title
Effect of pH on the proteome of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 under denitrifying conditions

### Description
The work is based on the quantitative proteomic analysis free of marking samples of the gram negative denitrification bacteria Paracoccus denitrificans grown at different pH.

### Sample Protocol
Once the cells were grown to an optical density of 0.3, the cells were harvested, washed, lysed by sonication and analyzed by LC-MS / MS.

### Data Protocol
Differentially expressed proteins were considered those that were significant in a t test, had a fold-change equal to or greater than two and with a p-value lower than 0.05.

### Publication Abstract
Denitrification is a respiratory process by which nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen. Incomplete denitrification results in the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and this is potentiated in acidic soils, which display reduced denitrification rates and high N<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> ratios compared to alkaline soils. In this work, impact of pH on the proteome of the soil denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 was analysed with nitrate as sole energy and nitrogen source under anaerobic conditions at pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.5. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the highest difference in protein representation was observed when the proteome at pH 6.5 was compared to the reference proteome at pH 7.2. However, this difference in the extracellular pH was not enough to produce modification of intracellular pH, which was maintained at 6.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.1. The biosynthetic pathways of several cofactors relevant for denitrification and nitrogen assimilation like cobalamin, riboflavin, molybdopterin and nicotinamide were negatively affected at pH 6.5. In addition, peptide representation of reductases involved in nitrate assimilation and denitrification were reduced at pH 6.5. Data highlight the strong negative impact of pH on NosZ synthesis and intracellular copper content, thus impairing active NosZ assembly and, in turn, leading to elevated nitrous oxide emissions.
