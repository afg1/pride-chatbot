### Title
Human UHMK1 interaction protein indentification

### Description
To explore the mechanism by which UHMK1 enhances the transcriptional activation of ATF4, we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to analyze the UHMK1 immunocomplex isolated from HEK293T cells.

### Sample Protocol
Flag tagged UHMK1 was transfected into HEK293T cells, with an empty vector as control. Flag M2 agarose beads (Sigma) were used to pull down the proteins which bind to UHMK1 overnight. The washing buffer (0.2 mM PMSF, 15% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P (NP) 40, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 150 mM KCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl) was made to rinse samples and then a TBS buffer followed. Finally, the eluted proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels which were cut for MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Parent Mass Error Tolerance: 20ppm；Fragment Mass Error Tolerance: 0.05Da; Precursor Mass Search Type: monoisotopic; Enzyme: Trypsin; Max Missed Cleavages: 3; Fixed Modifications: Carbamidomethylation; Variable Modifications: Acetylation(Protein N-term), Oxidation(M); Max Variable PTM Per Peptide: 3
