### Title
Phosphoproteom of Cashmere goat fetal fibroblast（LC-MS/MS）

### Description
This study examined differences in the phosphorylation levels of proteins in response to amino acid signals in Cashmere goat fetal fibroblasts.

### Sample Protocol
Gfb cells were divided into five groups, including the NT, SS, AAS, LeuS, and AllS groups, which were treated by non-treated, serum sarvation, amino acid starvation,leucine re-stimulation and all amino acids re-stimulation. Protein samples were subjected to reductive alkylation treatment with iodoacetamide to break disulfide bonds. Next, trypsin was used to digest the proteins into short peptides. Then, TiO2 was used to enrich phosphopeptides. Subsequently, the phosphopeptides were detected using LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
The raw data were analyzed using ProteinPilot software, based on the results of protein database searches to identify proteins. Based on quality control measures, we were able to obtain reliable peptides and proteins. The phosphosites were screened out according to the molecular weights of the phosphoric acid group.
