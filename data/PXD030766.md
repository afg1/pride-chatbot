### Title
pH taxis in African trypanosomes

### Description
The collective movement of African trypanosomes on semi-solid surfaces, known as social motility, is presumed to be due to migration factors and repellents released by the parasites. Here we show that procyclic (insect midgut) forms acidify their environment as a consequence of glucose metabolism, generating pH gradients by diffusion. Early and late procyclic forms exhibit self-organising properties on agarose plates.  While early procyclic forms are repelled by acid and migrate outwards, late procyclic forms remain at the inoculation site. Furthermore, trypanosomes respond to exogenously formed pH gradients, with both early and late procyclic forms being attracted to alkali. pH taxis is mediated by multiple cyclic AMP effectors: deletion of one copy of adenylate cyclase ACP5, or both copies of the cyclic AMP response protein CARP3, abrogates the response to acid, while deletion of phosphodiesterase PDEB1 completely abolishes pH taxis. The ability to sense pH is biologically relevant as trypanosomes experience large changes as they migrate through their tsetse host. Supporting this, a CARP3 null mutant is severely compromised in its ability to establish infections in flies. Based on these findings, we propose that the expanded family of adenylate cyclases in trypanosomes might govern other chemotactic responses in their two hosts.

### Sample Protocol
Isolation of HA-tagged protein complexes was performed with anti-HA magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) the addback cell line expressing CARP3-HA, or derivatives expressing CARP3-HA.  ACP3-myc or ACP5-myc tagged cell lines were used for Myc-tagged proteins isolation with with 5 µg monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Cat No: MA1-980) and Dynabeadsª Pan Mouse IgG (Cat No: 11041), both from ThermoFisher Scientific (Invitrogen). Isolated protein complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis, or protein bands were cut from Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels and analyzed at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core Facility of the University of Bern. The gel pieces were reduced, alkylated and digested by trypsin as described elsewhere [Gunasekera K. et al. (2012) BMC Genomics, 13:556 doi:10.1186/1471-2164-13-556]. An aliquot of 5 uL from the digests were were trapped on a µPrecolumn C18 PepMap100 (3 ?m, 100 , 300 ?m?5mm, ThermoFisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) and separated by backflush on a C18 column (C18, 3µm, 155, 0.075 mm i.d. x 150mm length, Nikkyo Technos, Tokyo, Japan) by applying a 40-minute gradient of 5% acetonitrile to 40% in water, 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. The column effluent was directly coupled to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Full Scan method was set with resolution at 70,000 with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 1E06 and maximum ion injection time of 50 ms. The data-dependent method for precursor ion fragmentation was applied with the following settings: resolution 17,500, AGC of 1E05, maximum ion time of 110 milliseconds, mass window 2.0 m/z, collision energy 27, under fill ratio 1%, charge exclusion of unassigned and 1+ ions, and peptide match preferred, respectively.

### Data Protocol
All MS data were processed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.14.0) with matching between neighboring gel bands activated, but not between different pull-downs, in order to avoid over-interpretation of the data. Fragment spectra were interpreted against a recent T.brucei protein database (TriTrypDB-50_TbruceiTREU927_AnnotatedProteins.fasta) supplemented by common contaminants. The trypsin cleavage rule allowed amide bond cleavage after lysine and arginine but not if a proline follows and up to three missed cleavage sites, fixed carbamidomethylation modification of cysteines, variable oxidation of methionine, acetylation of protein N-termini, and deamidation of asparigin and glutamin. Precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 15 and 20 ppm, respectively. Peptide spectrum matches, peptide and protein group identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) based on reversed database sequence matches, and a minimum of two razor or unique peptides were required to accept a protein group identification. Label-free protein abundances were calculated from the sum of the intensities of the three most intense peptides of each protein group (Top3 approach) after normalizing the peptide intensities by variance stabilization (vsn R package). Missing peptide intensities were imputed from a Gaussian distribution of width 0.3x sample standard deviation and centered at the sample distribution mean minus 2.5x sample standard deviation. Imputed Top3 protein intensities were called iTop3. Alternatively, MaxQuant calculated LFQ protein intensities were used. Differential abundance tests were performed using empirical Bayes statistics (limma R package) on log-2 transformed iTop3 or LFQ intensities, provided the protein groups were detected at least in one sample. Statistical testing and imputation were made using a set of freely available R package tools running under R studio.
