### Title
Comparative proteomics of defense response to AAL toxin

### Description
A comparative proteomics analysis on AAL toxin treated jai1 mutant and its wild type revealed that JA pathway promoted AAL toxin induced PCD by regulating the relevant PCD components and/or through other hormone pathways in a SlCOI1 dependent manner.</br></br>

### Sample Protocol
After extraction and quantification, the proteins were precipitated, iTRAQ labeled and resolved in strong cation exchange solvent, The peptides were fractionated using an Agilent HPLC system 1260 with a polysulfoethyl column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 5 μL, 300 Å; PolyLC, Columbia, MD, USA), flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-20% solvent B (25% (v/v) acetonitrile and 500 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.8)) over 50 min, followed by ramping up to 100% solvent B in 5 min. The absorbance at 280 nm was monitored; 12 fractions were collected and lyophilized. The fractions were resuspended in LC solvent A (0.1% formic acid in 97% water, 3% acetonitrile). A hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap (Q Exactive) MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used with high energy collisional dissociation (HCD) after each MS. The instrument was run in data dependent mode with a full MS (400-2000 m/z) resolution of 70,000 and five ms/ms (17500 resolution). The MS system was interfaced with an automated Easy-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germerling, Germany). Each sample fraction was loaded on a Acclaim Pepmap 100 pre-column (20 cm×75 μm; 3 μm-C18) and separated using a PepMap RSLC analytical column (250 cm×75 μm; 2 μm-C18) with a flow rate at 350 nl/min. A linear gradient of solvent A (0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile) was run for 95 min, followed by a ramp to 98% B for 5 min.

### Data Protocol
The raw MS/MS data files were searched against the specified non-redundant database with Solanum lycopersicum L. (combined Uniprot, NCBI and phytozome database ) using the Fraglet and Taglet searches under the ParagonTM algorithm (28) of ProteinPilot v.4.5 software (AB Sciex, Inc.). Plant species, fixed modification of methylmethane thiosulfate-labeled cysteine, fixed iTRAQ modification of amine groups in the N-terminus and lysine, and variable iTRAQ modifications of tyrosine were considered. In addition, the iTRAQ data was analyzed using ProteoIQ2.7 with Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and the following parameters: peptide tolerance at 10 ppm, tandem MS tolerance at ± 0.01 Da, peptide charges of 2+ to 5+, trypsin as the enzyme, allowing one missed cleavage, iTRAQ label and methyl methanethiosulfonate (C) as fixed modifications, and oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) as variable modifications. Peptides and proteins were filtered using ProteoIQ 2.7 (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with strict peptide and protein probabilities, 0.8 and 0.95, respectively. Peptide probability was applied to filter peptide assignments obtained from MS/MS database searching results using predictable false identification error rate. To be differentialy expressed with significance, a protein must have been quantified with a fold change > 1.2 or < 0.8, with at least three spectra in at least two of the four biological replicates,  along with a Fisher’s combined probability < 0.05.

### Publication Abstract
Alternaria alternata f.sp. Lycopersici (AAL) toxin induces programmed cell death (PCD) in susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves. Jasmonate (JA) promotes AAL toxin induced PCD in a COI1 (coronatine insensitive 1, JA receptor)-dependent manner by enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this process, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis using tomato jasmonic acid insensitive1 (&#x2009;jai1), the receptor mutant of JA, and its wild type (WT) after AAL toxin treatment with or without JA treatment. A total of 10367 proteins were identified in tomato leaves using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) quantitative proteomics approach. 2670 proteins were determined to be differentially expressed in response to AAL toxin and JA. Comparison between AAL toxin treated jai1 and its WT revealed the COI1-dependent JA pathway regulated proteins, including pathways related to redox response, ceramide synthesis, JA, ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Autophagy, PCD and DNA damage related proteins were also identified. Our data suggest that COI1-dependent JA pathway enhances AAL toxin induced PCD through regulating the redox status of the leaves, other phytohormone pathways and/or important PCD components.
