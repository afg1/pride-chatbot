### Title
Proteomic profile of membrane vesicles of E. faecium

### Description
Vesicles were derived from 4 different E. faecium strains at 2 different growth conditions (exponential growth phase in nutrient rich medium / stationary growth in nutrient limiting medium). After purification of the vesicles the proteomic profile was obtained.

### Sample Protocol
Supernatant was obtained from bacterial cultures. Through ultra centrifugation vesicles were obtained and purified through density gradient centrifugation. Vesicle samples were resuspended in urea, reduced and lysyl endopeptidase digested and trypsin. Peptides were fractionated using a 2-100% acetonitrile gradient. The separated peptides were analyzed using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data were collected in data dependent mode using a Top10 method. The raw data were processed using the Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software. The fragmentation spectra were searched against the whole genome sequence (WGS) data of the strain itself using the Sequest HT program.
