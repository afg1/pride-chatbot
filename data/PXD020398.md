### Title
Support-vector-machine learning analysis of the human cerebrovascular thrombi proteome: an exploratory study

### Description
Mechanical retrieval of thrombotic material from acute ischemic stroke subjects provides a unique entry point for translational research investigations. Here, we resolved the proteomes of cardioembolic and atherothrombotic cerebrovascular human thrombi and applied an articial intelligence routine to analyze potential protein signatures between the two selected groups.

### Sample Protocol
In the angiography room, after retrieval, thrombi were immediately frozen at -80°C in a dedicated transportable azote freezer (Voyager, Air Liquide). In the laboratory, samples were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis. After initial mashing in a glass potter at 4°C in RIPA buffer, thrombi were further dissolved using an ultrasonic liquid processor (10 applications of 1 second each at 4°C; Vibra-cell VCX130PB, VWR) and then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5427R) at 1,200 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. Protein concentration was assessed by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Protein extracts (20 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a short (2 cm) migration. Single pieces of gel including separated proteins except hemoglobin were excised for each sample and proteins were digested in-gel using Trypsin.

### Data Protocol
MS data analysis was performed using the MaxQuant software with default settings (v1.5.5.1). All MS/MS spectra were searched using the Andromeda search engine against the UniProtKB Reference proteome UP000005640 database for Homo sapiens (release 2019_03, https://www.uniprot.org/) and the contaminant database in MaxQuant. Default search parameters were applied. Oxidation and Acetylation were used as variable modifications and Carbamidomethyl was used as fixed modification. FDR was set to 1% for peptides and proteins. A representative protein ID in each protein group was automatically selected using an in-house bioinformatics tool (Leading v3.2). Graphical representation and statistical analysis of MS/MS data were performed using Perseus (v1.6.1.1). Label-free quantification was used to highlight proteins differentially expressed between samples.
