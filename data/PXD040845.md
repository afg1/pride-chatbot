### Title
Temporal proteomic profiling reveals functional pathways in vaccinia-induced cell migration

### Description
Viral diseases have alwanys been intricate and persistent issues throughout the world and lack of holistic discoveries of molecular dysregulations of virus-host interactions. The temporal proteomics strategy can identify various differentially expressed proteins and offer collaborated interaction networks under pathological conditions. Herein, temporal proteomics at various hours post infection of Vero cells were launched to uncover molecular alternations during vaccinia virus-induced cell migration. Different stages of infection were included to differentiate gene ontologies and critical pathways at specific time points of infection. The enrichment of functional interaction networks and pathways verified the significances of regulation of actin cytoskeleton and lamellipodia during vaccinia virus-induced fast cell motility. Current results offer the systematic proteomic profiling og molecular dysregulations at different stages of vaccinia virus infection and potential biomedical targets for treating viral diseases.

### Sample Protocol
Vero cells were cultured and harvested at 12, 24, 36 h.p.i.s and temporal proteomic sample preparations were implemented. The digested peptides were quantitatively calculated and lyophilized overnight. All samples were analyzed by onliene nano flow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry performed on an EASY-nanoLC 1200 system connected to a Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF-X mass sepectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Raw data of DIA were processed and analyzed by Spectronaut 15 with default settings and retention time prediction type was set to dynamic iRT. Searched databases was downloaded from Uniport database. The identified protein groups were filtered before further statistical analysis. Fold changes calculated by protein raw intensities and t-tests for p values were implemented. The GO enrichment and pathway enrichment were done by DAVID. Protein-protein interaction network was launched by STRING.
