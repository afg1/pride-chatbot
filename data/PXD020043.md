### Title
Venom proteome of the snake Bothrops bilineatus from the Brazilian state of Rondônia

### Description
Proteomics characterization of the venoms of the two subspecies (bilineatus and smaragdinus) of the poorly studied South American palm pitviper Bothrops bilineatus from the Brazilian state of Rondônia

### Sample Protocol
Crude venom was fractionated by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised, proteins reduced and carbasmidomethylated, digested with trypsin, and the digest submitted to LC-MS/MS on nano-Acquity UltraPerformance LC® (UPLC®) using a BEH130 C18 (100µm x 100mm, 1.7 µm particle size) column in-line with a Waters SYNAPT G2 High Definition Mass Spectrometry System.

### Data Protocol
Fragmentation spectra were interpreted i) manually (de novo sequencing), ii) using the on-line form of the MASCOT Server (version 2.6) against Release 234 of October 15th, 2019 of the  NCBI non-redundant database, and iii) processed in Waters Corporation's ProteinLynx Global SERVER 2013 version 2.5.2. (with Expression version 2.0). The following search parameters were used: Taxonomy: bony vertebrates; Enzyme: trypsin (two missed cleavage allowed); MS/MS mass tolerance was set to ± 0.6 Da; carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidation of methionine were selected as fixed and variable modifications, respectively.

### Publication Abstract
We report a structural and functional proteomics characterization of venoms of the two subspecies (<i>Bothrops bilineatus</i><i>bilineatus</i> and <i>B. b. smaragdinus</i>) of the South American palm pit viper from the Brazilian state of Rond&#xf4;nia and <i>B. b. smaragdinus</i> from Per&#xfa;. These poorly known arboreal and mostly nocturnal generalist predators are widely distributed in lowland rainforests throughout the entire Amazon region, where they represent an important cause of snakebites. The three <i>B. bilineatus</i> spp. venom samples exhibit overall conserved proteomic profiles comprising components belonging to 11 venom protein classes, with PIII (34-40% of the total venom proteins) and PI (8-18%) SVMPs and their endogenous tripeptide inhibitors (SVMPi, 8-10%); bradykinin-potentiating-like peptides (BBPs, 10.7-15%); snake venom serine proteinases (SVSP, 5.5-14%); C-type lectin-like proteins (CTL, 3-10%); phospholipases A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>, 2.8-7.6%); cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP, 0.9-2.8%); l-amino acid oxidases (LAO, 0.9-5%) representing the major components of their common venom proteomes. Comparative analysis of the venom proteomes of the two geographic variants of <i>B. b. smaragdinus</i> with that of <i>B. b. bilineatus</i> revealed that the two Brazilian taxa share identical molecules between themselves but not with Peruvian <i>B. b. smaragdinus</i>, suggesting hybridization between the geographically close, possibly sympatric, Porto Velho (RO, BR) <i>B. b. smaragdinus</i> and <i>B. b. bilineatus</i> parental populations. However, limited sampling does not allow determining the frequency of this event. The toxin arsenal of the South American palm pit vipers may account for the in vitro recorded collagenolytic, caseinolytic, PLA<sub>2</sub>, l-amino acid oxidase, thrombin-like and factor X-activating activities, and the clinical features of South American palm pit viper envenomings, i.e., local and progressively ascending pain, shock and loss of consciousness, spontaneous bleeding, and profound coagulopathy. The remarkable cross-reactivity of the Brazilian pentabothropic SAB antivenom toward the heterologous <i>B. b. bilineatus</i> venom suggests that the paraspecific antigenic determinants should have been already present in the venom of the last common ancestor of the <i>Bothrops</i> &#x2033;<i>jararaca</i>&#x2033; and &#x2033;<i>taeniatus</i>&#x2033; clades, about 8.5 Mya in the mid-late Miocene epoch of the Cenozoic era. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifiers PXD020043, PXD020026, and PXD020013.
