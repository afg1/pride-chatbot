### Title
Validating the use of CRISPR interference for the modulation of glycosylation in Burkholderia cenocepacia

### Description
To determine whether CRISPR interference can be used to modulation glycosylation in Burkholderia cenocepacia

### Sample Protocol
Burkholderia cenocepacia cells were grown for 16 hours at 37 degrees celsius with aeration in the presence of 1% L-Rhamnose, and 1mL of cells at an approximate OD 600nm of 1.0 were harvested and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed in 4% Sodium Deoxycholate (SDC; in 100mM Tris (pH 8.5) through boiling at 95*C, 2000rpm on a ThermoMixer). Protein was quantified by a BCA assay, and 50ug of protein was reduced with 10mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and alkylated with 40mM 2 â€“ Chloroacetamide (CAA). Proteins were digested with 1:100 (wt/wt) trypsin for 16 hours at 37 degrees celsius. Peptides were cleaned up using housemade Styrenedivinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Data was searched in FragPipe (MSFragger) version 15.0 with label-free quantificationn (LFQ) and Match between runs (MBR) enabled.
