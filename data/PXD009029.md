### Title
Application of Multiplexed Ion Mobility Spectrometry towards the Identification of Host Protein Signatures of Treatment Effect in Pulmonary Tuberculosis

### Description
Utilized sensitive, high throughput multiplexed ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to characterize the serum proteome of tuberculosis  patients prior to and at 8 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Goal is to identify a serum protein signature indicative of treatment effect.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline
