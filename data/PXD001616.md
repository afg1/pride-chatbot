### Title
A search for protein biomarkers links olfactory signal transduction to social immunity

### Description
We have looked across different honey bee colonies, multiple generations and multiple genetic backgrounds to identify protein expression patterns correlated with hygienic behaviour

### Sample Protocol
All samples were honey bee worker antennae. Tissues were pulverized in a bead mill and protein was extracted and digested in solution with trypsin. Peptide samples were dimethylated in triplex for quantitation

### Data Protocol
All data processing was done using MSQuant. Quantitation and search results from MSQ are provided

### Publication Abstract
None
