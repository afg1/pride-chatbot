### Title
Cancer burden is controlled by mural cell- β3-integrin regulated crosstalk with tumor cells

### Description
Phosphoproteomics analysis were performed in WT and β3-integrin-null pericytes. On the other hand, phosphoproteomics experiments were done in B16F0 melanoma cells treated for 24 hours with conditioned medium from WT and β3-integrin-null pericytes.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were lysed in 8 M urea buffer. This concentration was reduced to 2 M with 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0) and proteins were digested with trypsin. Peptide solutions were desalted using Oasis-HLB cartridges and phosphopeptides enriched using TiO2

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using Mascot. Label-free quantification was performed using Pescal, a in-house developed software that uses extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for all the peptides identified in at least one sample across all samples

### Publication Abstract
Enhanced blood vessel (BV) formation is thought to drive tumor growth through elevated nutrient delivery. However, this observation has overlooked potential roles for mural cells in directly affecting tumor growth independent of BV function. Here we provide clinical data correlating high percentages of mural-&#x3b2;3-integrin-negative tumor BVs with increased tumor sizes but no effect on BV numbers. Mural-&#x3b2;3-integrin loss also enhances tumor growth in implanted and autochthonous mouse tumor models with no detectable effects on BV numbers or function. At a molecular level, mural-cell &#x3b2;3-integrin loss enhances signaling via FAK-p-HGFR-p-Akt-p-p65, driving CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 production. In particular, mural-cell-derived CCL2 stimulates tumor cell MEK1-ERK1/2-ROCK2-dependent signaling and enhances tumor cell survival and tumor growth. Overall, our data indicate that mural cells can control tumor growth via paracrine signals regulated by &#x3b2;3-integrin, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism of cancer growth control.
