### Title
Rapid profiling of protein complex re-organization in perturbed systems

### Description
Protein complexes constitute the primary functional modules of cellular activity. To respond to perturbations, complexes undergo changes in their abundance, subunit composition or state of modification. Understanding the function of biological systems requires global strategies to capture this contextual state information on protein complexes and interaction networks. Methods based on co-fractionation paired with mass spectrometry have demonstrated the capability for deep biological insight but the scope of studies using this approach has been limited by the large measurement time per biological sample and challenges with data analysis. As such, there has been little uptake of this strategy beyond a few expert labs into the broader life science community despite rich biological information content. We present a rapid integrated experimental and computational workflow to assess the re-organization of protein complexes across multiple cellular states. It enables complex experimental designs requiring increased sample/condition numbers. The workflow combines short gradient chromatography and DIA/SWATH mass spectrometry with a data analysis toolset to quantify changes in complex organization. We applied the workflow to study the global protein complex rearrangements of THP-1 cells undergoing monocyte to macrophage differentiation and a subsequent stimulation of macrophage cells with lipopolysaccharide. We observed massive proteome organization in functions related to signaling, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix during differentiation, and less pronounced changes in processes related to innate immune response induced by the macrophage stimulation.  We therefore establish our integrated differential pipeline for rapid and state-specific profiling of protein complex organization with broad utility in complex experimental designs.

### Sample Protocol
Protein complexes fractionation was performed as previously described 30. THP-1 cells were thawed and lysed in mild conditions by homogenization with a lysis buffer composed by 0.5% NP-40 detergent  and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 400 nM Na3CO4, protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, MI, USA)). Cell debris and membranes were removed by 15 minutes of ultracentrifugation (55,000Ã—g, 4 Â°C) and the detergent was removed by 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane and exchanged with the SEC buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). The samples were concentrated for a final protein concentration between 7-12 Âµg/Âµl.  After 5 min of centrifugation at 16,900 Ã—g at 4 Â°C, the supernatant was directly injected to a Yarraâ€�SECâ€�4000 column (300 Ã— 7.8 mm, pore size 500 Ã…, particle size 3 Î¼m, Phenomenex, CA, USA). 0.8 mg of native proteome extract (estimated by Pierceâ„¢ BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) was injected for each SEC run at 4 Â°C with a flow rate of 500 Âµl/min, for a total chromatographic time of 30 min. Fraction collection was performed in the retention time window from 10 to 26 min, at 0.25 min per fraction, for a total of 64 fractions collected. The molecular weight calibration curve for SEC fractionation was obtained by running a  protein standard mix  (Column Performance Check Standard, Aqueous SEC 1, AL0-3042, Phenomenex, CA, USA) before each sample injection. Sample processing for bottom-up analysis of SEC fractions was performed on a 96-well plate MWCO filters (AcroPep Advance Filter Plates for Ultrafiltration 1mL Omega 10K MWCO; Pall Corporation, USA) 45. Prior to usage, the filters are washed twice with 200 Î¼l of water that was successively removed by centrifugation at 1800 g for 30 min. 64 fractions for each sample (total fraction volume 125 Î¼l) were loaded and concentrated on the filters through centrifugation, until the complete removal of the SEC buffer.    Protein denaturation and reduction was obtained incubating the samples at 37 Â°C for 30 min with 5 mM of TCEP in 8M Urea/20 mM ammonium bicarbonate (AMBIC) (pH 8.8). Alkylation of cysteine residues was performed adding a final concentration of 50 mM IAA/20 mM AMBIC and incubating in the dark and room temperature for 1 h. After the reaction, the plates were centrifuged for removing the Urea buffer and washed for three times with 20 mM AMBIC. Protein digestion was carried out at 37 Â°C for 16 h, adding to each well 1 Î¼g of trypsin (Promega, Switzerland) and 0.3 Î¼g of Lysyl Endopeptidase (Mass Spectrometry grade, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan). The resulting peptides were collected by centrifugation and the plates were washed once more with 100 ul of ddH20.

### Data Protocol
DDA data analysis for the library generation DDA-MS data acquired from peptide fractionation of the full THP-1 cell lysates (see above) were processed for the SWATH library generation following the protocol previously described 48.   MS spectra were searched for peptide matches against the human UniProt/SwissProt reference database (reviewed, canonical entries, June 2017) using Comet 2018.01 rev. 0 MS/MS search engine. The search was carried out using trypsin cleavage, 30 ppm precursor and 0.05 Da fragment ion mass tolerance, carbamidomethyl (C) as static and oxidation (M) as variable modification and a maximum of 2 enzyme missed cleavages. The results from the search were statistically scored using Peptide Prophet (statistical validation of PSMs) and iProphet (peptide sequence validation) of the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP v5.0.0 POLAR VORTEX rev 0), filtering the results at 1% peptide FDR (0.815939 iprob) as determined using the tool Mayu 49. A wider peptide-level FDR cut-off (5% FDR on protein level, compared to requiring 1% FDR) was chosen in order to increase sensitivity for the recovery of true positive peptide signals.  The resulting spectra were then gathered for the generation of the consensus spectra library using SpectraST including retention time calibration. The 6 most abundant fragment ion transitions per precursor from the bn or yn ion series were selected, with a m/z range of 350-2000 and aa fragment charge states 1-2. The final library contains query parameters for 506,717 precursors of 73,007 peptides mapping to 9375 protein groups. Moreover, to the spectra consensus library reverse decoy (506,581 decoys transitions) were generated for the FDR scoring provided by the SWATH/DIA data analysis workflow.  DIA/SWATH data analysis  For the THP-1 experiment the DIA/SWATH data collected from the analysis of SEC fractions were analyzed through peptide-centric analysis, querying 506,717 fragment precursors from the sample-specific peptide library generated (see above) in the SWATH MS2 spectra, using OpenSWATH v2.150,51 PyProphet and TRIC52 workflow. Initially, one global classifier was trained on a subsampled set of SEC fractions across the experiment using pyProphet-cli53. Peptides from all fractions were then quantified and scored using the pre-trained scoring function using pyProphet and TRIC. The HeLa benchmark dataset was analysed with Spectronaut v14 using a previously published HeLa CCL2 spectral library31.
