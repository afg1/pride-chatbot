### Title
Proteomics of Treg membrane proteins

### Description
The aim of this project is to identify total membrane proteins on rest and activated regulatory T cells.

### Sample Protocol
The membrane proteins were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, and then were enriched using strepavidin beads. The proteins were then eluted from the streptavidin beads and processed using paramagnetic bead (SP3 bead) technology for label free proteomic analysis.

### Data Protocol
The proteomic raw data were imported to MaxQuant to search protein FASTA files of mouse in Uniprot database.

### Publication Abstract
None
