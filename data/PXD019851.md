### Title
scorpion Centruroides vittatus venom proteomics

### Description
idenification and characterization of venom protein and peptide components from the scorpion Centruroides vittatus

### Sample Protocol
trysin digestion & reverse phase column chromatography with eluted proteins ionized with electrospray and mass spectrometry

### Data Protocol
scaffold analysis to verify MS/MS peptide and protein identifications

### Publication Abstract
Body tissue and venom glands from an eastern population of the scorpion <i>Centruroides vittatus</i> (Say, 1821) were homogenized and molecular constituents removed to characterize putative sodium &#x3b2; toxin gene diversity, RT-qPCR, transcriptomic, and proteomic variation. We cloned sodium &#x3b2; toxins from genomic DNA, conducted RT-qPCR experiments with seven sodium &#x3b2; toxin variants, performed venom gland tissue RNA-seq, and isolated venom proteins for mass spectrophotometry. We identified &gt;70 putative novel sodium &#x3b2; toxin genes, 111 toxin gene transcripts, 24 different toxin proteins, and quantified sodium &#x3b2; toxin gene expression variation among individuals and between sexes. Our analyses contribute to the growing evidence that venom toxicity among scorpion taxa and their populations may be associated with toxin gene diversity, specific toxin transcripts variation, and subsequent protein production. Here, slight transcript variation among toxin gene variants may contribute to the major toxin protein variation in individual scorpion venom composition.
