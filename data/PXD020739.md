### Title
Olfactory neuroepithelial proteome in Schizophrenia & cannabis

### Description
In this study, we evaluated the common proteomic profile, as well as, the exclusively deregulated proteins in ON cells from healthy controls cannabis users (HC/c), SCZ patients non-cannabis users (SCZ/nc) and SCZ patients cannabis users (SCZ/c) as compared to healthy controls non-cannabis users (HC/nc). Moreover, we investigated quantitative and functional differences between HC/c and SCZ, and we characterized the distinct effect of cannabis in SCZ comparing SCZ/nc and SCZ/c.

### Sample Protocol
ON cells derived from all experimental groups were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 50 mM DTT. The homogenates were spun down at 100.000 × g for 1 h at 15 °C and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-rad). Pool of aliquots of all samples in the sample sets were used as input for generating the SWATH-MS assay library. To increment the proteome coverage, in-solution and in-gel digestion workflows were applied. In the first one, protein material from each pooled sample was precipitated using methanol/chloroform extraction. Pellet was dissolved in 6 M urea, 100mM Tris, pH 7.8. Reduction was performed by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10mM and incubation at 25ºC for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation by 30 mM iodoacetamide was performed for 1h in the dark. An additional reduction step was performed by 30mM DTT, allowing the reaction to stand at 25ºC for 1h. The mixture was diluted to 0.6M urea using MilliQ-water, and after trypsin addition (Promega) (enzyme:protein, 1:50 w/w), the sample was incubated at 37ºC for 16h. Digestion was quenched by acidification with acetic acid. The digestion mixture was dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted with 40 ul of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) pH 9.8, and injected to an ÄKTA pure 25 system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with a high pH stable X-Terra RP18 column (C18; 2.1 mm × 150 mm; 3.5 μm) (Waters). Peptides were eluted with a mobile phase B (5mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN at pH 9.8) of 30-70% linear gradient over 45 min (A, 5mM ammonium formate in water at pH 9.8; B, 5mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN at pH 9.8). The UV signal was monitored at 215nm. Fractions were collected and evaporated under vacuum. Neighbouring fractions with the low signal intensity were subsequently pooled to generate fractions with similar peptide content. For the second digestion protocol, protein extracts (20 ug) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 0.75 mm thick polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel casted over a 12.5% resolving gel. Total gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 12 equals slides from each pooled sample were excised from the gel and transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Protein enzymatic cleavage was carried out with trypsin (Promega; 1:20, w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h as previously described (Shevchenko, A. et al. Nat Protoc 1(6), 2856 (2006)). Purification and concentration of peptides were performed using C18 Zip Tip Solid Phase Extraction (Millipore). The peptides recovered from in-gel and in-solution digestion processing were reconstituted into a final concentration of 0.5µg/µL of 2% ACN, 0.5% FA, 97.5% MilliQ-water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. MS/MS datasets for spectral library generation were acquired on a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (Sciex) interfaced to an Eksigent nanoLC ultra 2D pump system (Sciex) fitted with a 75 μm ID column (Thermo Scientific 0.075 × 250mm, particle size 3 μm and pore size 100 Å). Prior to separation, the peptides were concentrated on a C18 precolumn (Thermo Scientific 0.1 × 50mm, particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 Å). Mobile phases will be 100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) (buffer A) and 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA (buffer B). Column gradient was developed in a gradient from 2% B to 40% B in 120 min. Column was equilibrated in 95% B for 10 min and 2% B for 10 min. During all process, precolumn was in line with column and flow maintained all along the gradient at 300 nl/min. Output of the separation column was directly coupled to nano-electrospray source. MS1 spectra were collected in the range of 350-1250 m/z for 250 ms. The 35 most intense precursors with charge states of 2 to 5 that exceeded 150 counts per second were selected for fragmentation using rolling collision energy and MS2 spectra were collected in the range of 230–1500 m/z for 100 ms. The precursor ions were dynamically excluded from reselection for 15 s.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data acquisition was performed using AnalystTF 1.7 (Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through ProteinPilot v5.0 search engine (Sciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) (Shilov IV, Seymour SL et al Mol Cell Proteomics 2007) for database search. To avoid using the same spectral evidence in more than one protein, the identified proteins were grouped based on MS/MS spectra by the Progroup™ Algorithm, regardless of the peptide sequence assigned. False discovery rate (FDR) was performed using a non-lineal fitting method (Tang WH, Shilov IV, Seymour SL JPR 2008) and displayed results were those reporting a 1% Global FDR or better. Then, individual protein extracts from all experimental groups (n=20) were subjected to in-solution digestion, peptide purification and reconstitution prior to mass spectrometric analysis as previously described. For SWATH-MS-based experiments the TripleTOF 5600+ instrument was configured as described by Gillet et al (Gillet LC, Mol. Cell. Proteomics 11 (6) 2012). Using an isolation width of 16 Da (15 Da of optimal ion transmission efficiency and 1 Da for the window overlap), a set of 37 overlapping windows was constructed covering the mass range 450–1000 Da. In this way, 1 μL of each sample was loaded onto a trap column (Thermo Scientific 0.1 × 50mm, particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 Å) and desalted with 0.1% TFA at 3 μL/min during 10 min. The peptides were loaded onto an analytical column (Thermo Scientific 0.075 × 250mm, particle size 3 μm and pore size 100 Å) equilibrated in 2% acetonitrile 0.1% FA. Peptide elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 2 to 40% B in 120 min (mobile phases A:100% water 0.1% formic acid (FA) and B: 100% Acetonitrile 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Eluted peptides were infused in the mass-spectrometer. The Triple TOF was operated in swath mode, in which a 0.050 s TOF MS scan from 350 to 1250 m/z was performed, followed by 0.080 s product ion scans from 230 to 1800 m/z on the 37 defined windows (3.05 s/cycle). Collision energy was set to optimum energy for a 2 + ion at the center of each SWATH block with a 15 eV collision energy spread.  The resulting ProteinPilot group file from library generation was loaded into PeakView® (v2.1, Sciex) and peaks from SWATH runs were extracted with a peptide confidence threshold of 99% confidence (Unused Score ≥ 1.3) and FDR lower than 1%. For this, the MS/MS spectra of the assigned peptides were extracted by ProteinPilot, and only the proteins that fulfilled the following criteria were validated: (1) peptide mass tolerance lower than 10 ppm, (2) 99% of confidence level in peptide identification, and (3) complete b/y ions series found in the MS/MS spectrum.  Only proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides were considered.

### Publication Abstract
A close epidemiological link has been reported between cannabis use and schizophrenia (SCZ). However, biochemical markers in living humans related to the impact of cannabis in this disease are still missing. Olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) cells express neural features and offer a unique advantage to study biomarkers of psychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to find exclusively deregulated proteins in ON cells of SCZ patients with and without a history of cannabis use. Thus, we compared the proteomic profiles of SCZ non-cannabis users (SCZ/nc) and SCZ cannabis users (SCZ/c) with control subjects non-cannabis users (C/nc) and control cannabis users (C/c). The results revealed that the main cascades affected in SCZ/nc were cell cycle, DNA replication, signal transduction and protein localization. Conversely, cannabis use in SCZ patients induced specific alterations in metabolism of RNA and metabolism of proteins. The levels of targeted proteins in each population were then correlated with cognitive performance and clinical scores. In SCZ/c, the expression levels of 2 proteins involved in the metabolism of RNA (MTREX and ZNF326) correlated with several cognitive markers and clinical signs. Moreover, use duration of cannabis negatively correlated with ZNF326 expression. These findings indicate that RNA-related proteins might be relevant to understand the influence of cannabis use on SCZ.
