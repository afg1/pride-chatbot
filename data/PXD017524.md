### Title
Human BMSCs protein analysis that interact with TRAF4 during adipogenic differentiation

### Description
To explore the mechanism underlying the negative regulation of adipogenesis by TRAF4, we performed the LC-MS/MS experiments to identify the proteins that interact with TRAF4 during adipogenic differentiation.

### Sample Protocol
MSCs were seeded in 10-cm dishes, and MSCs were cultured in adipogenic medium for indicated days. All cells were lysed and coimmunoprecipitated using a DynabeadsTM Protein G Immunoprecipitation Kit (10007D, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently dyed using a Coomassie blue staining kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Differential bands were collected for further LC-MS/MS analysis for the TRAF4 interaction proteins in MSCs.
