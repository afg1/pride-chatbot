### Title
Evaluating the protein extraction methods for gut metaproteomics

### Description
Human stool samples were collected, microbial cells were harvested and subjected to protein extraction using different protocols for metaproteomics analyses. The protein extraction methods differ from the usage of different lysis buffer (SDS, urea and commercially available B-Per reagent), bead beating, ultrasonication and heating. The impacts of different protein extraction methods on metaproteomics results were evaluated with multiple criteria including protein yields, peptide identifications, taxonomic compositions and functional compositions.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracted using different protein extraction methods were precipitated, washed and resuspended in 6M urea (in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer). Equal amount of proteins were used for in-solution trypsin digestion followed by LC-MSMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data were search against gut microbiome database with a previously published MetaPro-IQ workflow.
