### Title
Gasdermin D mediates host cell death but not interleukin-1β secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected macrophages

### Description
Necrotic cell death represents a major pathogenic mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. It is increasingly evident that Mtb induces several types of regulated necrosis but how these are interconnected and linked to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines remains unknown. Exploiting a clinical cohort of tuberculosis patients, we show here that the number and size of necrotic lesions correlates with IL-1β plasma levels as a strong indicator of inflammasome activation. Our mechanistic studies reveal that Mtb triggers mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) and subsequently extensive macrophage necrosis which requires activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 driven mitochondrial damage is dependent on proteolytic activation of the pore forming effector protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) which links two distinct cell death machineries. Intriguingly, GSDMD, but not the membranolytic mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system is dispensable for IL-1β secretion from Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, our study dissects a novel mechanism of pathogen induced regulated necrosis by identifying mitochondria as central regulatory hubs capable of delineating cytokine secretion and lytic cell death.

### Sample Protocol
whole cell lysates were gained from uninfected and Mtb-infected J774.2 macrophages (MOI 5) 24 h post infection. The protein concentration was determined by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit and 50 µg protein was precipitated using ice-cold acetone. Chromatin degradation was achieved in a Bioruptor (10 min, cycle 30/30 sec) in 8 M urea buffer in 50 mM triethylammoniumbicarbonate (TEAB). Digestion was carried out via an in-solution digest. Briefly, proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 25°C and alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. Lys-C was added at a 1 to 75 enzyme to substrate ratio for pre-digestion for 4 h at 25°C. Afterwards, 50 mM TEAB was used to achieve a Urea concentration of 2 M for digestion with 1 µg/µl trypsin. Samples were incubated overnight, and digestion was stopped by acidification with 1% formic acid and samples were desalted on DVB-RPS Stage Tips. Data acquisition protocol: Mass spectrometry and data analysis was conducted by the CECAD Proteomics Core Facility at the University of Cologne. Briefly, all samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer that was coupled to an EASY nLC  (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) onto an in-house packed analytical column (50 cm — 75 µm I.D., filled with 2.7 µm Poroshell EC120 C18, Agilent). Peptides were chromatographically separated at a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min using the following gradient: 3-5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80 % acetonitrile) within 1.0 min, 5-30% solvent B within 91.0 min, 30-50% solvent B within 17.0 min, 50-95% solvent B within 1.0 min, followed by washing and column equilibration. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-independent acquisition mode. MS1 scans were acquired from 400-1220 m/z at a resolution of 35,000 and a maximum injection time of 60 ms. MSMS scans were acquired for 25 DIA windows at a resolution of 17,500 and 60 ms maximim injection time. The AGC target was set to 1e6 charges. The default charge state for the MS2 was set to 3. Stepped normalized collision energy was set to 27%. The MSMS spectra were acquired in centroid mode.

### Data Protocol
DIA data were analyzed in direct DIA mode using the PulsarX search engine with default parameters and a canonical mus musculus fasta library (SwissProt, 17,026 entries) in Spectronaut 13 (Biognosys).  Protein identifications were filtered for q-values below 0.01. Normalized intensities were exported and loaded into in Perseus version 1.6.1.1 (2).  The dataset was filtered for at least 3 out of 3 values in at least one condition. Remaining missing values were imputed with random values from the left end of the intensity distribution using Perseus defaults. Two sample Student´s T-test were calculated using permutation based FDR estimation.

### Publication Abstract
Necrotic cell death represents a major pathogenic mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. It is increasingly evident that Mtb induces several types of regulated necrosis but how these are interconnected and linked to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines remains unknown. Exploiting a clinical cohort of tuberculosis patients, we show here that the number and size of necrotic lesions correlates with IL-1&#x3b2; plasma levels as a strong indicator of inflammasome activation. Our mechanistic studies reveal that Mtb triggers mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) and subsequently extensive macrophage necrosis, which requires activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3-driven mitochondrial damage is dependent on proteolytic activation of the pore-forming effector protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which links two distinct cell death machineries. Intriguingly, GSDMD, but not the membranolytic mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system, is dispensable for IL-1&#x3b2; secretion from Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, our study dissects a novel mechanism of pathogen-induced regulated necrosis by identifying mitochondria as central regulatory hubs capable of delineating cytokine secretion and lytic cell death.
