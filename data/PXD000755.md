### Title
Lateral globus pallidus proteome

### Description
In order to analyse the globus pallidus proteome in a large-scale format, we used a multi-dimensional fractionation approach which combines isolation of anatomically-defined nuclei, and protein/peptide chromatographic fractionation strategies coupled to mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Peptide fractionation by HPLC. Protein material was precipitated using methanol/chloroform. Pellets (~ 700μg/pool) were dissolved in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and 6M urea. Reduction was performed by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10mM and incubation at 25ºC for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation by 30mM iodoacetamide was performed for 1h in the dark. An additional reduction step was performed by 30 mM DTT, allowing the reaction to stand at 25ºC for 1h. Proteins were digested for 4 h with Lys-C (Promega) at 37ºC (enzyme:protein, 1:140 w/w). The mixtures were then diluted to 0.6M urea using MilliQ-water, and after trypsin addition (Promega) (enzyme:protein, 1:50 w/w), the sample was incubated at 37ºC for 18 h. Digestion was quenched by acidiﬁcation with acetic acid. The digestion mixture (~ 350μg protein) was dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted with 40ul of 5mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) pH 9.8, and injected to an Ettan LC system with a high pH stable X-Terra RP18 column (C18; 2.1 mm x 150mm; 3.5μm) (Waters) at  a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Peptides were eluted with a mobile phase B of 5–65% linear gradient over 35 min (A, 5 mM ABC in water at pH 9.8; B, 5 mM ABC in acetonitrile at pH 9.8). 16-18 fractions were collected, evaporated under vacuum and reconstituted into 15 μl of 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 98% water. Protein fractionation by isoelectric focusing (IEF). Approximately 500 μg of each pooled sample was precipitated with methanol/chloroform. The pellet were re-suspended in 300 μl of IEF rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, 0.5% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte) and loaded on 17 cm pH 3–10 IPG strip in a focusing tray. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a Bio-Rad PROTEAN IEF system (Bio-Rad). Conditions for performing IEF were as follows: after rehydration of the IPG strip for 12 h at 50 V and 20°C, the run was started at 250 V for 15 min. followed by rapid voltage ramping to 8000 V without exceeding 50 A/strip. The IEF run was finished when the voltage reached 35,000 Vhr. The voltage was held at 500 V until the run was stopped. The IEF run was performed at 20 °C. Each entire IPG strip was divided into 25 equal parts (~ 0.7 cm each) for in-gel reduction, alkylation, and digestion. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed with 20 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 12 h at 37ºC. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, 85% acetonitrile. Peptide mixtures were completely dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 20 μl 98 % MilliQ-H20, 2 % acetonitrile, and 0.1 % formic acid.

### Data Protocol
MS analysis was performed on a Q-TRAP 5500 system (ABSciex) with a NanoSpray® III ion source (ABSciex). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode at unit resolution. Each fraction was analyzed twice in technical replicates.  For MS/MS analysis, survey scans were acquired from m/z 400 to 1000 with up to 6 precursors selected for MS/MS from m/z 230 to 1000 using dynamic exclusion, and the rolling collision energy was used to promote fragmentation. MS/MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.5.2 (AB Sciex) and spectra ﬁles were processed through Protein Pilot TM Software (v.4.0.8085-ABSciex) using ParagonTM Algorithm (v.4.0.0.0) (Shilov et al. 2007) for database search against the concatenated target-decoy UniProt human database (Database: uniprot_sprot_20100622). For each substructure, 82-86 runs were processed sequentially with output ﬁles for each individual fraction and a merged, non-redundant output ﬁle generated for protein identiﬁcations. To minimize the false positive identification of proteins, an unused ProtScore ≥ 2 (corresponding to 99% confidence) was used as the qualification criteria. False discovery rate (FDR) was performed using a non-lineal fitting method (Tang et al. 2008) and displayed results were those reporting a protein level-FDR lower than 1%.
