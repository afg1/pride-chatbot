### Title
The Gut Microbiota Metabolite Succinate promotes Adipose Tissue Browning in Crohn’s Disease

### Description
In Crohn’s disease (CD), microbe-host interactions are altered, with changes in microbial’s communities and barrier defects leading to translocation of microbes to surrounding adipose tissue (AT). We evaluated the presence of beige AT depots in CD and questioned whether succinate and/or bacterial translocation promotes white-to-beige transition in adipocytes.

### Sample Protocol
Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) AT biopsies, serum and plasma were obtained from patients with active (n=21) and inactive (n=12) CD, and from healthy controls (n=15). Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and AT macrophages (ATMs) were isolated from VAT biopsies.

### Data Protocol
Acquired spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (v2.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Mascot search engine (v2.6, Matrix Science Ltd., Boston, MA), as described.10 Raw pProteomic data were evaluated to identify significant differences (p<0.05) in proteins between the different groups.
