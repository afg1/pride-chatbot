### Title
A systematic comparison of label-free, SILAC and TMT techniques to study early adaption towards inhibition of EGFR signaling in the colorectal cancer cell line Difi

### Description
The epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling network plays an essential role inproliferation and survival of colorectal cancer cells. For this reason, EGFR is targeted using therapeutic antibodies blocking EGFR signalling (e.g. cetuximab). However, anti-EGFR therapy is rarely curative as subpopulations of tumor cells survive the initial treatment and develop therapy-resistance. To analyse cellular signalling and assess the quantitative changes of the proteome and the phosphoproteome several proteomics approaches have been established. Here, we compared the widely used quantification strategies label-free (LF), SILAC and TMT and systematically evaluated their technical characteristics including coverage, technical variability, complementarity and the ability to assess statistical significant differences. We studied the dynamics of the EGFR signalling network upon treatment withcetuximab after 0 h, 3 h and 24 h, representing the first cellular adaption towards anti-EGFR therapy, with the aim to identify the most powerful approach for monitoring cellular signalling in this setup. We demonstrate that LF had a superior coverage regarding quantification of both, the proteome and phosphoproteome, while SILAC exhibited the highest precision resulting in superior assessment of differentially abundant proteins and class I phosphosites (p-sites). TMT was outperformed by the other two approaches, illustrating its critical dependency on the applied labelling-design.  On the protein level, we observed only little regulation upon cetuximab treatment, whereas a great fraction of p-sites was significantly regulated after 3 h and 24 h. The dynamics of significantly regulated p-sites illustrated an initial downregulation of the EGFR and MAPK signalling pathways, which was partially rescued as soon as after 24h.  We identified upregulation and signalling via ERBB3 as a possible mechanism bypassing the blockage of EGFR. Moreover, phosphorylation motifs associated to calcium signalling were continuously upregulated, thereby representing compensatory signalling presumably resulting in the observed reactivation of MAPK1/3 (Erk1/2).

### Sample Protocol
Experimental design and statistical rationale All samples originated from a single cell culture experiment. Four experimental replicates for each time point (0 h, 3 h, 24 h) and treatment condition (cetuximab treated or untreated control) were analyzed for each quantification approach. DiFi cells were metabolically labelled with either light (L), medium (M), or heavy (H) arginine and lysine isotopes. The identical light-labelled samples were used for LF, SILAC, and TMT quantification. For LF all light-labelled samples were processed and analyzed individually. Each SILAC 3plex contained an untreated control and its corresponding cetuximab-treated sample, both labelled with medium and heavy isotopes. In addition, a reference mix of all light-labelled samples was spiked into each SILAC 3plex. SILAC samples were mixed at a final protein ratio of 1:1:1 with medium and heavy labels being swapped for half of the samples. For the TMT strategy, one replicate per time point and treatment condition was used for each 8plex sample. Analogous to the SILAC strategy, the reference mix of all light-labelled samples was labelled with two TMT channels and analysed with each measured TMT sample. The TMT-labelled peptide fractions were mixed in equal amounts and the channels were swapped for half of the samples.  Cell culture experiments and SILAC labeling The CRC cell line DiFi used as model organism Cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1.7 mM L-proline, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 75 cm2 flasks (4.8 x 10E6 cells per flask) with 14 ml working volume. After 72 h, cells were treated with cetuximab at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml. The control groups were left untreated. Cells were harvested after 0 h, 3 h and 24 h at 80 - 90% confluency. For SILAC experiments, lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) depleted DMEM medium was supplemented with isotope-labeled Lys and Arg to prepare heavy and medium versions of the medium. Metabolic labelling was performed as described previously. Briefly, cells were cultured either with light-labeled (L, Lys0, Arg0), medium-labeled (M, Lys4, Arg6, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or heavy-labeled (H, Lys8, Arg10) amino acids. L-proline was added to reduce arginine-to-proline conversion and incomplete SILAC labeling. After 5 - 6 passages, incorporation of labelled amino acids and arginine-to-proline conversion was tested by LC-MS/MS analysis. Cells used for experiments were labeled >95% .   Cell lysis and protein extraction Cells were washed twice with ice cold Dulbecco’s PBS followed by addition of ice cold RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were scraped from the flasks and the lysates were transferred into protein LoBind tubes. Proteins were precipitated over night at -20 °C using pre-cooled acetone. Precipitated proteins were and dissolved in ice cold lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were mixed and homogenized with a sonification probe. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay.  Protein digestion and peptide purification Proteins were reduced with DTT followed by alkylation with iodacetamide. Samples were digested with trypsin for 14 h at 37 °C. Peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA) on an ACQUITY-UPLC.   TMT labeling TMT 10plex labelling kits were used following the manufacturer’s instructions. The labelled peptide samples were mixed and purified on Oasis HLB cartridges followed by determination of the peptide concentrations using AAA. The TMT labelling efficiency was determined to be > 99 % by LC MS/MS analysis  Phosphopeptide enrichment and stage tip purification Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 beads.   LC-MS/MS analysis LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Excative Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system. Samples were analysed in randomised order for each quantification approach and with alternating order of proteome and corresponding phosphoproteome samples. Peptides were loaded and pre-concentrated on a trap column. Subsequent peptide separation was performed on an analytical column at a flow rate of 400 nl/min with a 180 min linear gradient from 5 to 40% solvent B (solvent A: 0.1% FA, solvent B: 0.1% FA / 84% acetonitrile). Data dependent acquisition of MS/MS spectra was performed with higher-energy collisional dissociation for the 10 highest abundant precursor peptide.

### Data Protocol
Raw data processing & peptide identification Generated *.raw files were processed with the MaxQuant software v.1.6.1.0 and spectra were searched with the Andromeda search algorithm against the human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (release 2016_11, 20120 entries). LF, SILAC and TMT data were searched separately. In detail, parameters were as follows: Trypsin/P was selected as enzyme in specific digestion mode with a maximum of two missed cleavage sides allowed. Fixed modification was set to carbamidomethyl at cysteine (C) resides. Methionine (M) oxidation and phosphorylation at serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y) were included as variable modifications with a maximum number of five modifications per peptide. False discovery rate (FDR) thresholds were set to 0.01 on peptide spectrum matching and on protein level. Identification of co-fragmented peptides (second peptides) and match between run (MBR) features were enabled. The minimum score for modified peptides was set to 40. Settings specific for the quantification approach were chosen as follows: For LF the label-free quantification algorithm (LFQ) was applied for proteome samples. For SILAC, Arg6 / Lys4 were set as medium and Arg10 / Lys8 as heavy labels. For improved quantification the re-quantify option was applied (mode: “Match from to”). The minimum ratio count for protein quantification was set to two, considering unmodified, oxidized (M) and phosphorylated (STY) peptides. TMT 10plex isobaric labels at lysine (K) and N-terminal position were chosen for TMT with a reporter mass tolerance of 0.01 Da and a minimum precursor intensity fraction of 0.75. Correction factors were considered according to the values provided by the manufacturer.  Data analysis  Data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel 2013, OriginPro (v.2018b, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA), R (v.3.5.2), R Studio (v.1.1.463) and the Perseus software (v.1.6.1.3). The online tool BioVenn (http://www.biovenn.nl/) was used to visualize data in area-proportional venn diagrams. Contaminants, observations only identified by site, and reversed hits were filtered out for protein data. Only protein groups (in the following referred to as proteins) with ≥ 1 unique peptide and ≥ 2 peptides in total were considered for further analysis. Proteins were considered as quantified if detected in at least 50% of replicates in each of the six experimental groups. For SILAC analysis ratios (M/L, H/L) were log2-transformed and normalized by replicate-wise median subtraction. TMT ratios were calculated by dividing individual reporter ion intensities by the arithmetic means of the two channels representing the reference mix. Computed ratios were log2-transformed and normalized by replicate-wise median subtraction. Batch effects between the analyzed TMT plexes were removed by protein-wise mean subtraction for each plex. Phosphosites were filtered for contaminants, reversed hits and a localization probability ≥ 75% (class I p-sites, in the following referred to as p-sites). Data analysis regarding p-sites was conducted analogously to the analysis of proteome data. Statistical analysis was performed using quantified proteins and p-sites.  Statistical analysis Hypothesis testing was carried out using Perseus. Differences between the experimental groups were assessed using t-statistics (two sided, unpaired, adjustment according to Benjamini-Hochberg). Ratios (fold changes) between the experimental groups were calculated using mean values. The significance threshold was set as an pFDR-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5. Hierarchical clustering was performed using p-sites with a pFDR-value ≤ 0.05 irrespective of the fold change cut off. Log2-transformed and z-scored data was analysed using Pearson-based distance measurement and average linkage. The number of generated clusters was predefined according to hypothesized possible regulation patterns.  Functional annotation, enrichment analysis and protein interaction network analysis Proteome data was annotated in Perseus with gene ontology biological processes (GO BP), and KEGG pathways (derived from Uniprot, “mainAnnot.homo_sapiens.txt”, downloaded: 2017_10). Annotations regarding p-sites were derived from Phosphosite plus (PTM data sets, downloaded: 2017_10). Proteins and p-sites passing the applied significance threshold were analysed using STRING (version 10.5). Networks were generated considering only highest confidence interactions (interaction score 0.9) without text mining as a source of interaction. Clusters of regulated p-sites were analysed for enriched phosphorylation-motifs and GO-terms using Perseus (Fisher exact test, adjustment according to Benjamini-Hochberg, default threshold of 0.04).

### Publication Abstract
We evaluated the quantification strategies label-free (LF), stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and tandem mass tags (TMT) and their performance in quantification of proteins and phosphosites (p-sites) to identify the most powerful approach for monitoring cellular signaling. We analyzed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling network, which plays an essential role in colorectal cancer, and studied its dynamics within 24 h upon treatment with the EGFR-blocking antibody cetuximab, representing the first cellular adaption toward therapy. LF achieved superior coverage but was outperformed by label-based approaches regarding technical variability, especially for quantification of p-sites. TMT showed the lowest coverage and most missing values. We found that its performance considerably decreases when experimental replicates are distributed over several TMT plexes. SILAC showed the highest precision and outstanding performance for quantification of p-sites, rendering it the method of choice for analyzing cellular signaling in cell culture models. On the protein level, we observed only little regulation upon cetuximab treatment, whereas a great fraction of p-sites was significantly regulated. These dynamics represented an initial downregulation of the MAPK pathway, which was partially rescued as early as 24 h after treatment. We identified upregulation and signaling via ERBB3 as well as calcium and cAMP signaling as possible mechanisms bypassing the blockage of EGFR.
