### Title
Proteomic and functional analysis of the effects of quinoxaline derivatives on Entamoeba histolytica

### Description
Quinoxalines are heterocyclic compounds that contain a benzene ring and a pyrazine ring. The oxidation of both nitrogen of the pyrazine ring results in quinoxaline derivatives (QdNO), which exhibit a variety of biological properties, including antiparasitic activity. However, its activity against Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan that causes human amebiasis, is poorly understood. Recently, our group reported that various QdNOs produce morphological changes in E. histolytica trophozoites, increase reactive oxygen species, and inhibit thioredoxin reductase activity. Notably, T-001 and T-017 derivatives were among the QdNOs with the best activity. In order to contribute to the characterization of the antiamebic effect of QdNOs, in this work we analyzed the proteomic profile of E. histolytica trophozoites treated with the QdNOs T-001 and T-017, and the results were correlated with functional assays. A total number of 163 deregulated proteins were found in trophozoites treated with T-001, and 131 in those treated with T-017. A set of 21 overexpressed and 24 under-expressed proteins was identified, which were mainly related to cytoskeleton and intracellular traffic, nucleic acid transcription, translation and binding, and redox homeostasis. Furthermore, T-001 and T-017 modified the virulence of trophozoites, since they altered their erythrophagocytosis, migration, adhesion and cytolytic capacity. Our results show that in addition to alter reactive oxygen species, and thioredoxin reductase activity, T-001 and T-017 affect essential functions related to the actin cytoskeleton, which eventually affects E. histolytica virulence and survival.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extract (500 μg) were applied to acrylamide 125 gel strips with an immobilized linear gradient of pH 4.0-7.0 (ReadyStrip ™ IPG strips pH 4.0-7.0, BioRad). Isoelectric focusing was performed with the Protean IEF i12 ™ cell system (BioRad), following the recommendations of the commercial company, under the following conditions: step 1: 250 V for 20 min, step 2: 8000 V for 1h, step 3: 8000 V for 26 h, step 4: 1500 V sustained. For the second dimension, the IPG strips were placed directly on the 12% polyacrylamide gel, along with 7 μL of pre-stained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V for 15 min, and at 200 V until the end of the run. The gel was immersed for 1 h in fixing solution (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid), washed three times with Milli- Q water for 10 min and stained with Sypro  Ruby Protein Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) according to the supplier recommendations. Finally, the stained gel was visualized with UV light through the ChemiDocs XRS system (Bio-Rad Laboratories), images were acquired using the Image lab 5.2.1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and spots were detected with the PDQuest 8.0.1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The protein profiles corresponding to the treatment with T-001 and T-017 were compared with that of trophozoites without treatment. Only those spots that showed statistically significant differences (Fold change> 2-fold) between control and treatments were considered as differentially expressed proteins and selected for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 45 spots were selected and excised with the EXQuest spot cutter (Bio-Rad Laboratories). They were bleached using acetonitrile (C2H3N) and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4CO3) in a 1:1 ratio for 15 min, and then washed with 50 μL acetonitrile for 5 min. All the liquid was removed, and samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 56ºC and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Later, they were washed with sodium bicarbonate and acetronitrile, and digested with 0.1 μg/μL trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, overnight at 37  C. The peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 25 μL of acetronitrile for 30 min, the solvent was removed by lyophilization and peptides were submitted to a MALDI-TOF / TOF analyzer (Ultraflex III, Bruker, Germany). Mass spectra 156 were acquired in positive ion mode.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra 156 were automatically submitted to Mascot software v.2.1 (http://www.matrixscience.com) for protein identification against the NCBI database for non-redundant proteins (http://www.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/) The identity of the proteins was corroborated in the amoeba (https://amoebadb.org/amoeba/) and Uniprot (https://www.uniprot.org) databases. Subsequently, they were categorized and classified according with their function, using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and the PANTHER classification system (Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship) (http://www.pantherdb.org/). The proteins with unknow function were searched in the Argot 2 program (http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/Argot2/index.php). Finally, information related to the involvement of these proteins in various biological processes in E. histolytica was documented
