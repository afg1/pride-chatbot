### Title
Quantitative mitochondrial proteome analysis during MceC expression time-course

### Description
Mitochondria were isolated from tetracycline-inducible control (EV) HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells expressing the C. burnetii effector protein MceC for 1, 4 and 8 hours.

### Sample Protocol
At each time point (1, 4 or 8 hours) 3 biological replicates of mitochondria were isolatedfrom both control or MceC-3XFLAG expressing HEK293 cells. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were acetone precipitated overnight. Samples were resuspended in 6M urea, 2M thiourea and reduced for 1 hour in the presence of 10mM DTT followed by alkylation with 40mM CAA. Samples were digested with Trypsin overnight and peptides purified using C18 stage tip.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0) with semi-specific trypsin cleavage option selected and data imported into Perseus (version 1.6.10.43) for further analysis.
