### Title
N-terminomics/TAILS profiling of macrophages after chemical inhibition of legumain

### Description
We developed a legumain inhibitor and activtiy based probes. Murine RAW264.7 cells were subjected to N-terminomics and shotgun proteomics analysis.

### Sample Protocol
RAW264.7 cell lysates were subjected to N-terminomics TAILS workflow and also to a shotgun proteomics

### Data Protocol
RAW files were ranon MaxQuant at 1 percent false discovery rate. A boxplot and student t test were used for statistics. N-terminomics data were analysed using topFIND.
