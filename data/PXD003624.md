### Title
Identification of BNC2 interactors in human LX2 cells using RIME

### Description
The goal of this study was to use Rapid Immunoprecipitation Mass spectrometry of Endogenous protein (RIME) assays (Mohammed et al., 2016) to identify transcriptional regulatory partners of the transcription factor BNC2 in LX2 cells. Protein complexes were immune-precipitated with an anti-BNC2 antibody (55220-1-AP, Proteintech) or control non-immune IgG (normal rabbit IgG #2729, Cell Signaling) before being subjected to MS.

### Sample Protocol
Sample were submitted to enzymatic digestion with trypsin Peptides were analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS on a TIMS TOF Pro (Bruker)

### Data Protocol
Proteins were identified with Mascot and FDR was set at 1% on peptides and proteins with PROLINE
