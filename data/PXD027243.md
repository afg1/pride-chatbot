### Title
Extensive regulation of enzyme activity by phosphorylation in Escherichia coli

### Description
This project contains intact protein MS and PRM data for several central metabolic enzymes in E.coli. The enzymes are both wild-type and mutant for several

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were all expressed in E.coli, purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, desalted on Amicon 5kDa cutoff filters and the intact proteins were resolved on a MabPac RP column.

### Data Protocol
Intact protein MS .raw files were deconvoluted with Xtract or Unidec software to generate protein average masses. Fragmentation data was deconvoluted using Xtract as part of the Freestyle software (Thermo). Neutral masses were then used as the input to Prosight light software, where masses were matched and compared to the primary sequence of enzymes, derived from DNA sequencing results
