### Title
Anti-FLAG-affinity purification of Umbrea associated factors

### Description
Anti-FLAG-affinity purification of Umbrea associated factors from nuclear extracts of Drosophila Schneider cells  expressing FLAG-HA-Umbrea. Anti-FLAG -affinity  purifications from Schneider cell nuclear extracts not expressing any FLAG-tagged protein served  as a control  SDS-PAGE separting both samples, 9 slices per sample, reduction and alkylation, digestion with trypsin. LC-MS on a Ultimate3000-LTQ Orbitrap XL Raw data were analysed using the MaxQuant 1.2.2.5 software package. Identified proteins were considered as interaction partners if their MaxQuant intensities displayed a greater than 10 fold enrichment compared to control anti-FLAG purifications from L2-4 nuclear extracts not expressing any FLAG-tagged protein

### Publication Abstract
Evolutionarily young genes that serve essential functions represent a paradox; they must perform a function that either was not required until after their birth or was redundant with another gene. How young genes rapidly acquire essential function is largely unknown. We traced the evolutionary steps by which the Drosophila gene Umbrea acquired an essential role in chromosome segregation in D. melanogaster since the gene's origin less than 15 million years ago. Umbrea neofunctionalization occurred via loss of an ancestral heterochromatin-localizing domain, followed by alterations that rewired its protein interaction network and led to species-specific centromere localization. Our evolutionary cell biology approach provides temporal and mechanistic detail about how young genes gain essential function. Such innovations may constantly alter the repertoire of centromeric proteins in eukaryotes.
