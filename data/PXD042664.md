### Title
CFdb: A harmonized resource of co-fractionation mass spectrometry data

### Description
A total of 411 co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) experiments were downloaded from public proteomics repositories such as PRIDE and MassIVE, then re-analyzed with MaxQuant. This repository provides complete MaxQuant outputs from all 411 experiments.

### Sample Protocol
Sample processing is described in the original studies. In this dataset we performed the reanalysis of the following ProteomeXchange datasets: PXD013868,PXD015406,PXD022340,PXD025571,PXD021452,PXD002892,PXD010919,PXD021530,PXD006694,PXD021451,PXD019253,PXD002327,PXD002325,PXD022855,PXD027704,PXD002326,PXD022856,PXD016469,PXD033084,PXD036475,PXD013198,PXD006543,PXD017659,PXD003754,PXD004566,PXD006660,PXD024625,PXD003509,PXD017463,PXD023017,PXD005968,PXD016733,PXD013300,PXD016732,PXD013264,PXD011088,PXD017465,PXD019004,PXD014617,PXD014936,PXD029352,PXD015749,PXD008974,PXD013369,PXD011304,PXD028149,PXD025478,PXD001220,PXD007288,PXD013809,PXD023211,PXD013093,PXD021500,PXD017650,PXD021422,PXD022357,PXD017614,PXD013213,PXD014820,PXD013214,PXD019513,PXD016521,PXD018422,PXD009039,PXD009831,PXD009511,PXD009833,PXD009832,PXD014607,PXD009714,PXD009834,PXD030050,PXD012865,PXD002323,PXD002324,PXD002321,PXD002640,PXD002322,PXD021386,PXD002320,PXD023443,PXD002681,PXD021385,PXD013280,PXD013281,PXD013282,PXD021454,PXD002319,PXD011182,PXD013321,PXD013322,PXD013004,PXD019900,PXD022309,PXD014016,PXD017840.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0) was used to re-analyze all experiments. Separate searches were carried out with and without STY phosphorylation as a variable modification.

### Publication Abstract
We present CFdb, a harmonized resource of interaction proteomics data from 411 co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) datasets spanning 21,703 fractions. Meta-analysis of this resource charts protein abundance, phosphorylation, and interactions throughout the tree of life, including a reference map of the human interactome. We show how large-scale CF-MS data can enhance analyses of individual CF-MS datasets, and exemplify this strategy by mapping the honey bee interactome.
