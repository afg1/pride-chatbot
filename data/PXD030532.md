### Title
Cross-linking of the Endolysosomal System Reveals Potential Flotillin Structures and Cargo

### Description
Lysosomes are well-established as the main cellular organelles for the degradation of macromolecules and emerging as regulatory centers of metabolism. They are of crucial importance for cellular homeostasis, which is exemplified by a plethora of disorders related to alterations in lysosomal function. In this context, protein complexes play a decisive role, regulating not only metabolic lysosomal processes but also lysosome biogenesis, transport, and interaction with other organelles. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry, we analyzed lysosomes and early endosomes. Based on the identification of 5,376 cross-links, we investigated protein-protein interactions and structures of lysosome- and endosome-related proteins. In particular, we present evidence for a tetrameric assembly of the lysosomal hydrolase PPT1 and a heterodimeric structure of FLOT1/FLOT2 at lysosomes and early endosomes. For FLOT1-/FLOT2-positive early endosomes, we identified >300 proteins presenting putative cargo, and confirmed several substrates for flotillin-dependent endocytosis, including the latrophilin family of adhesion G protein-coupled receptors. 

### Sample Protocol
Lysosomes were enriched from sixty-four 10 cm plates / replicate containing 6 x 106 HEK293 cells per plate using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). SPION-containing lysosomes were retained using a magnetic stand in combination with magnetic columns and pelleted. Lysosomal pellets were resuspended to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and cross-linked in two states (intact and disrupted) with the MS cleavable cross-linker disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO) at a concentration of 0.25 mM. Subsequently, samples were proteolytically digested and fractionated using strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) into 240 fractions. The 120 fractions containing the majority of cross-linked peptide pairs were analyzed with a MS2/MS3 CID/ETD method on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos.

### Data Protocol
Thermo *.raw files from cross-linked samples were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4, utilizing Mascot and XlinkX. The following settings were used for both algorithms: precursor ion mass tolerance: 10 ppm; orbitrap fragment ion mass tolerance: 20 ppm; ion trap fragment ion mass tolerance: 0.5 Da; fixed modification: carbamidomethylation at cysteine; variable modification: oxidation at methionine; number of allowed missed cleavage sites: 2; minimum peptide length: 5; cross-linking site: lysine. Data were searched against Swiss-Prot Homo sapiens (Entries: 20,365, version 16th of May 2019) in combination with the cRAP database containing common contaminants (https://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.htmL). Peptide identification were accepted with a false discovery rate of 1 % and 5 % at cross-linked peptide spectrum level in combination with a minimum XlinkX 2.4 score of 40. The Proteome Discoverer XlinkX workflow was split into two branches with a cross-link and standard peptide search. MS2 spectra containing indicative DSSO reporter ions were analyzed employing predefined “MS2-MS2-MS3” and “MS2” search options. Spectra, which did not contain reporter ions were searched using Mascot 2.5.1 for the identification of unmodified peptides. Mascot searches were performed with Proteome Discoverer using the following settings: precursor ion mass tolerance: 10 ppm; fragment ion mass tolerance: 50 mmu; fixed modification: carbamidomethylation at cysteine; variable modifications: oxidation of methionine; number of allowed missed cleavages: 2. Thermo *.raw DIA files were analyzed using Spectronaut (Version: 14.7.20, Biognosys). Initially, hybrid spectral libraries were generated with the Pulsar search engine integrated into Spectronaut, based on the respective datasets utilizing DDA and DIA files applying the following parameters: Swiss-Prot Homo sapiens (Entries: 20,365, version 16th of May 2019) in combination with the cRAP database; enzyme: trypsin; number of allowed missed cleavages: 2; fixed modification: carbamidomethylation at cysteine; variable modification: oxidation of methionine; MS1/MS2 mass tolerance: dynamic. For each peptide, the 3-6 most abundant b/y ions were selected for library generation, dependent on the signal intensity. Dynamic retention time alignment was performed based on the high-precision iRT concept (Bruderer et al., 2016). Resulting identifications were filtered with a 1 % FDR cut off on the precursor and protein level (q-value < 0.01). For matching of DIA data to the spectral library, the highest data point within the selected m/z value scan was used for intensity extraction applying the system default mass tolerance strategy. For quantification interference correction was enabled, quantifying the peak area of fragment ions applying the Q-value data filtering approach, where only individual observations that pass the Q-value thresholds are considered.

Lysosomes are well-established as the main cellular organelles for the degradation of macromolecules and emerging as regulatory centers of metabolism. They are of crucial importance for cellular homeostasis, which is exemplified by a plethora of disorders related to alterations in lysosomal function. In this context, protein complexes play a decisive role, regulating not only metabolic lysosomal processes but also lysosome biogenesis, transport, and interaction with other organelles. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry, we analyze lysosomes and early endosomes. Based on the identification of 5376 cross-links, we investigate protein-protein interactions and structures of lysosome- and endosome-related proteins. In particular, we present evidence for a tetrameric assembly of the lysosomal hydrolase PPT1 and a heterodimeric structure of FLOT1/FLOT2 at lysosomes and early endosomes. For FLOT1-/FLOT2-positive early endosomes, we identify &gt;300 putative cargo proteins and confirm eleven substrates for flotillin-dependent endocytosis, including the latrophilin family of adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.
