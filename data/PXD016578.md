### Title
Extracellular vesicles from Notch activated cardiac mesenchymal stem cell promote myocyte proliferation and neo-vasculogenesis

### Description
Cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (C-MSC) are a novel mesenchymal stem cell subpopulation derived from cardiac tissue, whichi are reported to be responsible for cardiac regeneration. Notch siganling is believed to aid in cardiac repair following myocardial injury.Here, we investigated the difference of protein cargo content among extracellular vesicles from wild type C-MSC, Notch1 knock out C-MSC and  Notch1 activated C-MSC.

### Sample Protocol
Extracellular vesicles were isolated using size exclusion column method.

### Data Protocol
Samples were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition in positive mode using Orbitrap MS analyzer for precursor scan. Collision-induced dissociation was used as fragmentation method.Raw data were processed using Proteome discoverer(V1.4) and submitted for SequestHT serch against the Uniprot human database.

### Publication Abstract
Cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (C-MSCs) are a novel mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) subpopulation derived from cardiac tissue, which are reported to be responsible for cardiac regeneration. Notch signaling is believed to aid in cardiac repair following myocardial injury. In this study, we have investigated the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from Notch1 engineered C-MSCs on angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation in ischemic myocardium. C-MSCs were isolated from Notch1<sup>flox</sup> mice (C-MSC<sup>Notch1 FF</sup>). Notch1 gene deletion was accomplished by adenoviral vector-mediated Cre recombination, and Notch1 overexpression was achieved by overexpression of Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD). EVs were isolated by using the size exclusion column method. Proteomic composition of EV was carried out by mass spectrometry. A mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model was generated by permanent left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation. Intramyocardial transplantation of Notch1 knockout C-MSCs (C-MSCs<sup>Notch1 KO</sup>) did not have any effect on cardiac function and scar size. On the other hand, transplantation of N1ICD-overexpressing C-MSCs (C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup>) showed significant improvement in cardiac function and attenuation of fibrosis as compared to the control (PBS) group and non-modified C-MSC groups. C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> differentiated into smooth muscle cells and formed new vessels. Proteomics profiling identified several proteins, such as lysyl oxidase homolog-2 and biglycan, as highly enriched proteins in EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup>. Go term analysis indicated that EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> were enriched with bioactive factors, potent pro-repair proteins responsible for cell migration and proliferation. EV-C-MSCs <sup><i>Notch1FF</i></sup> and EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> were strongly proangiogenic under both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> conditions. EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> caused dense tube formation <i>in vitro</i> and increased neovasculogenesis in the peri-infarct area <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> attenuated endothelial cell (EC) and CM apoptosis under oxidative stress and ischemic injury. Similarly, EV-C-MSC<sup>Notch1 FF</sup> and EV-C-MSC<sup>N1ICD</sup> treatment improved cardiac function and decreased fibrosis in mice post-MI. EV-C-MSCs<sup>N1ICD</sup> were very effective in improving cardiac function and decreasing fibrosis. Notch1 signaling is a strong stimulus for cardiac regeneration by C-MSCs. EVs secreted by Notch1-overexpressing C-MSCs were highly effective in preventing cell death, promoting angiogenesis and CM proliferation, and restoring cardiac function post-MI. Overall, these results suggest that Notch1 overexpression may further enhance the effectiveness of EVs secreted by C-MSCs in cell-free therapy.
