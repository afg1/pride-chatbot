### Title
In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics - yeast UniProt proteome with isoforms analysis

### Description
This dataset is no actual new study but the results of the benchmark of the Yeast Gold Dataset used in the manuscript "In-depth Analysis of Protein Inference Algorithms using a Workflow Framework and Well-Defined Metrics".

### Sample Protocol
The sample was processed as described in Ramakrishnan, S. R. et al., Integrating shotgun proteomics and mRNA expression data to improve protein identification. Bioinformatics 2009, 25, (11), 1397-403

### Data Protocol
For the identification a precursor tolerance of 25 ppm, a fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da, one missed cleavage and the variable modifications for oxidation of M were allowed.
