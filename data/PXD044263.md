### Title
Comparative proteomic identification of Rab GTPase interactors in Arabidopsis

### Description
Rab GTPases are key spatio-temporal regulators of endomembrane trafficking and endomembrane compartment identity across eukaryotes. This therefore makes them ideal targets for study of endomembrane compartment and trafficking pathway composition. In plants, few definitive interactors of Rab GTPases and cargoes of their associated trafficking pathways are known, hindering our understanding of how plants may accomplish and support some unique aspects and requirements of their post-Golgi trafficking systems. The purpose of this work was to identify candidate interactors of different post-Golgi Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis. Co-IPs were performed against tagged-versions of three different post-Golgi Rab GTPases: RAB-A5c, RAB-A2a and RAB-G3f, as well as against control wild-type (Col-0) plants. Comparative ranking of the different proteomes produced candidate interactor lists enriched in possible specific interactors of each Rab GTPase, as well as generic shared interactors. This dataset forms the basis of the characterisation work of several upcoming publications.

### Sample Protocol
All plants were of the Columbia ecotype. 20-30 seeds were surface sterilised and germinated in 100ml conical flasks containing 20mL growth medium (0.3x Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma, Poole, UK), 1% sucrose, 0.05% MES pH5.7) and incubated on an orbital shaker at 60rpm under 16h days and 21oC for 14 days when naphthyl acetic acid was added to 5µM. Roots were harvested 3 days later and 4-5g were ground with sand in a pestle and mortar chilled on ice using 2 volumes of chilled extraction buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 50mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5mM PMSF, 100µM GTP-g-S and Complete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor (Roche) as recommended.  Cell debris was pelleted (4oC, 1,800xg 10 min) and DTSSP (3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate)) was added at 1mM to the supernatant which was incubated on ice for 30 min followed by quenching with TRIS-HCl pH7.5 at 50mM on ice for 10 minutes.  Microsomes were pelleted onto a cushion of 2M sucrose by centrifugation at 541,000xg for 30 min at 4oC and resuspended in 1.8ml extraction buffer with 2% CHAPS. Insoluble material was pelleted at 541,000xg for 30 min at 4oC and 200mL anti-GFP mMACS magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) were added to the supernatant followed by 60 minutes incubation on ice with gentle agitation. Bound proteins were recovered from the beads according to the manufacturer’s recommendation and were eluted in 50mL Laemmli protein loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a NuPAGE Novex 4-12 Bis Tris polyacrylamide gel (Thermofisher Ltd) and run until the sample had entered approximately 0.5cm into the resolving gel. In-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS spectrometry were performed at the Central Proteomics Facility, University of Oxford (www.proteomics.ox.ac.uk) on three replicates per genotype. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) separation was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive High Field Mass Spectrometer for tandem MS–MS analysis. Samples were loaded onto a 10 cm long home packed column (Reprosil-Pur C18-Aq, 3 micron beads, Dr Maisch) over a 60 min gradient of 2–35% acetonitrile in 5% DMSO, 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. MS1 scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z with the top 12 most abundant precursors targeted for HCD fragmentation. Raw files from each injection were converted to a MASCOT Generic Format (MGF) and searched on the MASCOT server (version 2.5.1) against the UPR Arabidopsis Thaliana database (dated 2015/02/11). The search parameters allowed for 2 missed cleavages, a peptide mass tolerance of ± 10 ppm with carbamidomethyl as a fixed modification on cysteine and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. Fragment mass tolerance was set to ± 0.02 Da.

### Data Protocol
Proteins were quantified using the label-free SInQ pipeline (Trudgian et al., 2011), with a q-value of ≤ 0.01 (corresponding to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR)), using only peptide spectrum matches with a q-value ≤ 0.01. Proteins that were not detected in all three replicates of the YFP:RAB-G3f immunoprecipitation were eliminated from the dataset. The remainder were ranked on their SIn values (Trudgian et al. 2011) in three ways: (i) by their abundance in the immunoprecipitate from untransformed plants (lowest to highest) then by their mean abundance in the YFP:RAB-G3f sample (highest to lowest); (ii) by dividing the value in the RAB-G3f dataset by the combined values for total microsomes and the untransformed sample; and (iii) by dividing the values for the YFP:RAB-G3f sample by the combined values for YFP:RAB-A2a and YFP:RAB-A5c. The rank position in each of the rankings i-iii were then summed and a final ranking was made on this sum (lowest to highest). Prior to ranking, zero values (protein undetected) were eliminated by adding half the value of the least abundant protein in the entire dataset to SIn value of every protein. Statistical analysis was performed using the PLGEM (power law general error method) on pairwise samples (Trudgian et al., 2011).

### Publication Abstract
Members of the NETWORKED (NET) family are involved in actin-membrane interactions. Here we show that two members of the NET family, NET4A and NET4B, are essential for normal guard cell actin reorganization, which is a process critical for stomatal closure in plant immunity. NET4 proteins interact with F-actin and with members of the Rab7 GTPase RABG3 family through two distinct domains, allowing for simultaneous localization to actin filaments and the tonoplast. NET4 proteins interact with GTP-bound, active RABG3 members, suggesting their function being downstream effectors. We also show that RABG3b is critical for stomatal closure induced by microbial patterns. Taken together, we conclude that the actin cytoskeletal remodelling during stomatal closure involves a molecular link between actin filaments and the tonoplast, which is mediated by the NET4-RABG3b interaction. We propose that stomatal closure to microbial patterns involves the coordinated action of immune-triggered osmotic changes and actin cytoskeletal remodelling likely driving compact vacuolar morphologies.
