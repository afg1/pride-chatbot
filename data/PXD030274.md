### Title
Proteome-wide identifying site non-specific cross-linking peptides with SpotLink

### Description
We developed SpotLink to identify site non-specific cross-links from the proteome scale. Here described the Abeta dataset and the HeLa dataset to evaluate SpotLink.

### Sample Protocol
For the Abeta dataset, we prepared the aggregated Abeta sample and cross-linked it by SDA. After digesting it into peptides, we analyzed the sample by LC-MS/MS. For the HeLa dataset, we in-vivo cross-linked the HeLa with SDA. And we extracted membrane-related cell components. By fractioning into several fractions, we analyzed the sample by LC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
We identified the cross-links by SpotLink.And we verified the reliability of these cross-linking information through a variety of methods
