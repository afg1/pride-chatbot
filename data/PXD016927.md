### Title
Quantitative proteomic analysis of global protein acetylation in PRRSV infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages

### Description
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is a serious viral disease affecting global swine industry. At present, PRRSV vaccines fail to prevent this disease. Consequently, new antiviral strategies to compensate for the inefficacy of available vaccines are urgently required. Lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) regulating an array of pathological and physiological conditions. In this study, we profiled the global acetylome using acetylation specific antibody based enrichment and Tandem mass tag (TMT) label LC-MS in PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). As a result, 3731 lysine acetylation sites on 1421 cellular proteins were identified and quantified 6 hours post infection (hpi). Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially acetylated proteins revealed their involvement in various biological processes, including the host immune response and energy metabolism.

### Sample Protocol
2.1 Virus and cells culture High pathogenicity PRRSV strain Hn07-1 (GenBank accession no. KX766378) was isolated from pigs in China in 2007. Marc-145 cells were preserved in our laboratory and cultured in Dulbecco���������s modified Eagle���������s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37���������, 5��������� CO2. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were isolated from 6-week-old clinically healthy piglets that were free of PRRSV infection assessed through lung lavage as previously described. PAMs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 ���������, 5% CO2. 2.2 Virus inoculation PAMs were plated into dishes, and washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. PAMs were infected with PRRSV strain hn07-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 1 h, and non-inoculated cells were compared as mock controls. Post-inoculation, cells were washed with PBS and cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FBS at 37 ���������, 5% CO2 for 6 h.  2.3 Protein extraction, trypsin digestion and TMT labelling  PRRSV-infected PAMs were lysed in 8 M urea, 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 3 ������M TSA and 50 mM NAM, and samples were sonicated on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz). Cell debris were discarded and samples were centrifuged at 12000 g at 4 ������C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined via BCA assay. Protein samples were reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 ������C and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, samples were diluted in 100 mM TEAB to reduce the urea concentration to less than 2 M. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass for overnight digestion, followed by a 1: 100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for 4 h digestion. For TMT labelling (Table 1), peptide desalting was performed on a Strata X C18 SPE column (Phenoenex). Peptides were vacuum-dried, reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB, and processed according to the manufacturer���������s protocols (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). TMT reagent was dissolved in acetonitrile, mixed with the peptides or 2 h at room temperature. Peptides were pooled, desalted, and dried by vacuum centrifugation.  2.4 HPLC fractionation and affinity enrichment of acetylated peptides Peptides were fractionated using high pH reverse-phase HPLC on a Thermo Betasil C18 column (5 ������m particles, 10 mm ID, and 250 mm length). Briefly, peptides were separated into 60 fractions over 1 h at a gradient of 8% - 32% acetonitrile (pH 9.0). Samples were combined into 4 fractions, and peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation.  To enrich anti-lysine acetylation peptides, tryptic peptides were dissolved in NETN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% NP-40, pH 8.0) and incubated with prewashed Anti-acetyl-lysine antibody conjugated agarose beads (PTM-104, PTM Biolabs, Hangzhou, China) at 4������C overnight with gentle shaking. Beads were washed four times with NETN buffer and twice with ddH2O. Peptides bound to the antibodies were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and repeat elutions were performed on three occasions. Peptide fractions were combined and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Finally, fractions were further desalted with C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and analysed through LC-MS/MS.  2.5 LC-MS/MS Analysis Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and directly loaded onto reverse-phase analytical columns (15-cm length, 75 ������m i.d.). Gradients were subjected to a gradient of 7% to 22% of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) over 26 min, 22% to 35% for 8 min, and 80% for 3 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system.  Peptides were subjected to Nano electrospray ionization (NSI) followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in an Orbitrap fusion (Thermo) coupled to the UPLC. The m/z scan range was 350 to 1550 for full scans, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. The fixed first mass was set as 100 m/z, and peptides were selected for MS/MS using normalized collision energy settings as 28. Ion fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15000. The electrospray voltage was 2.0 kV. A data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans were applied for the top 20 precursor ions, and dynamic exclusions were set at 15.0 s to prevent ion repeated scanning. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4 to avoid overfilling of the ion trap.

### Data Protocol
Unpaired t-tests were used for statistical analyses. Gene Ontology (GO) and protein domain annotation of the identified differentially acetylated proteins were derived from the InterProScan database (v.5.14-53.0 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/). KEGG online service tools KAAS (v.2.0 http: //www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main) and KEGG mapper (V2.5 http:// www.kegg.jp/kegg/mapper.html) were used to annotate protein pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The subcellular localization of differentially acetylated proteins were predicted using Wolfpsort (v.0.2http://www.genscript.com/psort/wolf_psort.html). Differentially acetylated protein sequence motif analysis were performed using MoMo (V5.0.2 http://meme-suite.org/tools/momo); functional enrichment analysis were performed using the Perl module (v.1.31 https:// metacpan.org/pod/Text::NSP::Measures::2D::Fisher). Protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed using Blast (v.2.2.26http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the R package networkD3 (v.0.4 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/networkD3/).

### Publication Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a serious viral disease affecting global swine industry. Due to the lack of effective vaccines, new antiviral strategies to compensate for the inefficacy of available vaccines are urgently required. Lysine acetylation, as an important post-translational modification during infection, plays a key regulatory role in host antiviral responses. In this study, the global acetylome is profiled using acetylation specific antibody-based enrichment and tandem mass tag label high-affinity purification liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). As a result, 3731 lysine acetylation sites on 1421 cellular proteins are identified. Bioinformatics analysis of the different acetylated proteins revealed their involvement in various biological processes, including the host immune response and energy metabolism. These findings will contribute to the understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis and identify new cellular targets for anti-PPRSV therapeutics.
