### Title
A Comparison of Tenocyte Populations from the Core and Periphery of Equine Tendons

### Description
Tendon is a highly organized, dense connective tissue that has been demonstrated to have very little turnover. In spite of the low turnover, tendon can grow in response to loading, which may take place primarily at the periphery. Tendon injuries and recurrence of injuries are common in both human and animal in sports. It is unclear why some areas of the tendon are more susceptible to such injury and whether this is due to intrinsic regional differences in extracellular matrix (ECM) production or tissue turnover. This study aimed to compare populations of tenocytes derived from the tendon core and periphery. Tenocytes were isolated from equine superficial digital flexor tendons (SDFT), and the proliferation capacity was determined. ECM production was characterized by immuno- and histological staining and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Core and periphery SDFT cultures exhibited comparable proliferation rates and had very similar proteome profiles, but showed biological variation in collagen type I deposition. In conclusion, the intrinsic properties of tenocytes from different regions of the tendon are very similar and other factors in the tissue may contribute to how specific areas respond to loading or injury.

### Sample Protocol
For each cell line, 3 × 104 cells/cm2 were seeded into two wells of a 6-well plate and cultured for 4 days in matrix-medium at 37oC in 5% CO2. After, cells were washed in PBS three times and lysed with 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5 for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were digested with Lys-C protease (20 ng/µg protein) in 10% acetonitrile with 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 at 37oC for 3 h and with additional trypsin (10 ng/µg protein) for 16 h. After, samples were acidified with an equal volume of 2% trifluoroacetic acid and vortexed. Acidified samples were then run through equilibrated stage tips containing Empore C18 filters (3M). Peptides were eluted in 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Dehydrated samples were then resuspended in 2% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid containing indexed retention time peptides (iRT peptides at 1:500, Biognosys AG). Peptide concentrations were measured using a DS-11 FX+ spectrophotometer (DeNovix). For each sample, 1 µg peptides were loaded onto a 2-cm C18 trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), connected in-line to a 50-cm C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Easy-Spray LC column, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 0.1% formic acid in water at 750 bar, using the Easy-nLC 1200 high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the column oven operating at 45oC. Peptides were eluted over a 140-minute gradient ranging from 6% to 60% of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at 250 nl/min, and the Orbitrap Fusion instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was run in a data-dependent-MS/MS (DD-MS2) top speed method. Full MS spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 000, with an AGC target of 4x105 or maximum injection time of 50 ms and a scan range of 400–1500 m/z. The MS2 spectra were obtained in the ion trap operating at rapid speed, with an AGC target value of 1 × 104 or maximum injection time of 35 ms, a normalized higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energy of 30 and an intensity threshold of 1.7e4. Dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s, and ions with a charge state <2, >7 or unknown were excluded. MS performance was verified for consistency by running complex cell lysate quality control standards, and chromatography was monitored to check for reproducibility.

### Data Protocol
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) with the data set identifier XXX. The raw files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4. Label-free quantitation (LFQ) was enabled in the processing and consensus steps, and spectra were matched against the Equus caballus validated and unvalidated databases obtained from Uniprot. Dynamic modifications were set as oxidation (M), deamidation (N, Q) and acetyl on protein N-termini. Cysteine carbamidomethyl was set as a static modification. All results were filtered to a 1% FDR, and protein quantitation done using the built-in Minora Feature Detector.
