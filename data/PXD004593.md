### Title
Quantitative non-canonical amino acid tagging based proteomics identifies distinct patterns of protein synthesis rapidly induced by hypertrophic agents in cardiomyocytes revealing new aspects of metabolic remodeling

### Description
cardiomyocytes undergo growth and remodeling in response to specific pathological or physiological conditions. We used pSILAC to identify newly synthesized proteins induced by these stimuli.

### Sample Protocol
ARVCs derived from wild type male rats were treated with insulin, phenylephrin and rapamycin. AHA-pSILAC was combined with mass spectrometry to identify newly synthesized proteins.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were submitted to Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for target decoy search using Sequest.
