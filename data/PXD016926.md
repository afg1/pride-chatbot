### Title
Global Metabolomic and Lipidomic Analysis Reveal the Synergistic Effect of Bufalin in Combination with Cinobufagin against HepG2 Cells

### Description
Chansu, which is prepared from the skin secretions of toad (Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor), is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Being the principal bioactive constituents of ChanSu, bufalin (BFL) and cinobufagin (CBF) have been shown to possess anticancer properties. TCM confer bioactivities through the synergistic effect between potential active ingredients, so as to interfere with the development of the disease, and ultimately achieve the therapeutic effect. We found that the anticancer effect was significantly potentiated by co-treatment of BFL and CBF as compared to mono-treatment, suggesting their synergistic interaction. To reveal their synergistic mechanisms, metabolomic and lipidomic profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC���������MS) were utilized to delineate the responses in HepG2 cells after treatment with BFL and CBF individually or in combination. Metabolic pathways including methionine metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were modulated and subsequently lead to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HepG2 cells. In particular, the discrepant regulation of methionine metabolism between mono-treatment and co-treatment of BFL and CBF may account for their synergistic effect. Our study provided novel insights into the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and synergistic effect, which may ultimately lead to better treatments for hepatoma.

### Sample Protocol
Metabolomic Experiments: After treatment with BFL, CBF and the combination of both, the medium was immediately removed using a vacuum pump. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL of cold PBS. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of ice cold MeOH/H2O (80:20, v/v) was added. Cells were detached by scraping and transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Samples were vortexed for 30 s followed by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. Thereafter, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ���������. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and dried down. The dried metabolites were re-dissolved in MeOH/H2O (50:50, v/v) with 1 ppm of 4-chloro-phenylalanine as internal standard. Lipidomic Experiments:After treatment with BFL, CBF and the combination of both, the medium was immediately removed using a vacuum pump. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL of cold PBS.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were first processed with MSConvert (ProteoWizard, http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/downloads.shhtml) and transformed to mzXML format. Then, data pretreatments including retention time correction and peak picking alignment were achieved using XCMS package with R language (Version 3.4.0). The data was normalized using quality control-robust LOESS signal correction (QC-RLSC) algorithm 14. The software LipidSearch (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was employed for peak picking and alignment of lipids. The resulting matrix including the mass profile of samples was imported into SIMCA software (Version 14.1, Umetrics, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and t-test were performed to screen significantly changed metabolites and lipids. The P value and fold change (FC) were calculated according to the peak intensities. The differential features were selected based on the following criteria: variable importance in the projection (VIP) value > 1, P value < 0.05 and FC >1.2 or <0.8. Metabolite identification was performed by searching accurate mass and MS/MS spectrum with METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu) databases, and further confirmed using available standards. Moreover, pathway analysis was processed by MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca). Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism 5 Software, Inc (La Jolla, CA, USA).

Chansu, which is prepared from the skin secretions of toad (<i>Bufo bufo gargarizans</i> Cantor), is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Being the principal bioactive constituents of Chansu, bufalin (BFL) and cinobufagin (CBF) have been shown to possess anticancer properties. TCM confers bioactivities through the synergistic effect between potential active ingredients, so as to interfere with the development of the disease, and ultimately achieve the therapeutic effect. We found that the anticancer effect was significantly potentiated by cotreatment with BFL and CBF compared to monotreatment, suggesting their synergistic interaction. To reveal their synergistic mechanisms, metabolomic and lipidomic profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was utilized to delineate the responses in HepG2 cells after treatment with BFL and CBF individually or in combination. Metabolic pathways, including methionine metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, were modulated and subsequently led to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HepG2 cells. In particular, the discrepant regulation of methionine metabolism between the monotreatment and cotreatment with BFL and CBF may account for their synergistic effect.
