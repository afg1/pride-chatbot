### Title
Identification of sulfhydryl-containing proteins and further evaluation of the selenium- tagged redox homeostasis-regulating proteins:Identification of cysteine sites using tandem orthogonal proteolysis strategy (TOP-ABPP).

### Description
We sought to identify exact modified cysteine sites by Se-probes using TOP-ABPP strategy and the acid cleavable azide-biotin tag was used to enrich and release the modified peptides for LC-MS/MS analys

### Sample Protocol
Cell lysates (1.5 mL, 2 mg/mL) were labeled with Se-probes (100 μM) and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 1 hour. The proteomes were then treated with 200 μM DADPS-Biotin-Azide, 1 mM CuSO4, 100 μM TBTA ligand, and 1 mM TCEP for 1 h. After that, the proteomes were precipitated with methanol/chloroform, resuspended in 1.2% SDS/PBS, and diluted to 0.2% SDS/PBS. The samples were then subjected to streptavidin enrichment, and on-bead trypsin digestion according to the published TOP-ABPP protocol. The reducing reagents such as DTT or TCEP should not be used in the bead-mixtures. The trypsin digest was separated from the beads through 1400g centrifuge, and the beads were washed with 3 × 300 μL PBS, 3 × 300μL H2O. The Si-O bond cleavage was carried out by incubating the beads with 3 × 100 μL 5% formic acid for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. The supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS was performed on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an EASY nLC 1200 system. The peptides were separated using an increasing gradient of aqueous acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase A was 0.1% FA in H2O, and mobile phase B was 0.1% FA in 80% ACN. The flow rate was 3 μL/min for loading and 0.3 μL/min for eluting. Labeled peptide samples were loaded onto an EASY-Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ES900) packed with 15 cm × 3 μm C18 resin. Under the positive-ion mode, full-scan mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range from 350 to 2000 using the Orbitrap mass analyzer with mass resolution of 70 000. MS/ MS fragmentation is performed in a data-dependent mode, in which the 20 most intense ions were selected from each full-scan mass spectrum for fragmentation by high-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD). MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 17,500 using the Orbitrap analyzer. Other important parameters: isolation window, 1.6 m/z units; default charge, 2+; normalized collision energy, 28%; maximum IT, 50 ms; dynamic exclusion, 20.0 s.

### Publication Abstract
Chemoproteomic profiling of sulfhydryl-containing proteins has consistently been an attractive research hotspot. However, there remains a dearth of probes that are specifically designed for sulfhydryl-containing proteins, possessing sufficient reactivity, specificity, distinctive isotopic signature, as well as efficient labeling and evaluation capabilities for proteins implicated in the regulation of redox homeostasis. Here, the specific selenium-containing probes (Se-probes) in this work displayed high specificity and reactivity toward cysteine thiols on small molecules, peptides and purified proteins and showed very good competitive effect of proteins labeling in gel-ABPP. We identified more than 6000 candidate proteins. In TOP-ABPP, we investigated the peptide labeled by Se-probes, which revealed a distinct isotopic envelope pattern of selenium in both the primary and secondary mass spectra. This unique pattern can provide compelling evidence for identifying redox regulatory proteins and other target peptides. Furthermore, our examiation of post-translational modification (PTMs) of the cysteine site residues showed that oxidation PTMs was predominantly observed. We anticipate that Se-probes will enable broader and deeper proteome-wide profiling of sulfhydryl-containing proteins, provide an ideal tool for focusing on proteins that regulate redox homeostasis and advance the development of innovative selenium-based pharmaceuticals.
