### Title
Saccharomyces cerevisiae & stress

### Description
Next-generation proteomics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for defining the response of this yeast to lanthanides.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT, the results were then parsed with IRMA, spectral counts were compared with PatternLab.
