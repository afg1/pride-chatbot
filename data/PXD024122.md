### Title
The ribosome-associated N-terminal acetyltransferase A regulates proteome stability in plants

### Description
N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The NatA complex is the dominant regulator of the N-acetylome in all eukaryotes. Here, we show that the imprinting of the proteome with acetylation marks by the essential NatA complex is a critical trigger for stabilizing plant proteins. Depleting 70% of the NatA activity by downregulation of the catalytic or the ribosome anchoring subunit causes 4-fold faster degradation of total proteins in Arabidopsis. This proteome dataset compares the NatA depleted Arabidopsis lines amiNAA10 and amiNAA15 to wild type Arabidopsis.

### Sample Protocol
Grinded Arabidopsis samples were processed with the Preomics iST protocol. After eluting from the solid phase extraction material, samples were completely dried and resuspended in buffer A* (2 % acetonitrile (v/v), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) and sonicated.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were analysed using MaxQuant version 1.6.2.10 with a UniProt FASTA file.
