### Title
Lipid droplet membrane proteins ubiquitylation

### Description
This project was aimed to identify lipid droplet (LD) membrane proteins that are ubiquitylated. We isolated LDs from the livers of control and alcohol-fed rats and extracted LD membrane proteins.

### Sample Protocol
The LD membrane proteins were trypsin digested and immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin remnant motif antibody K-ε-GG that selectively binds to diGLy motif left behind by ubiquitylated proteins following their trypsin digestion. Following immunoprecipitation peptides were eluted from antibody-protein complex for their identification by mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS data generated by HCD and ETD fragmentation were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer 2.0 using parallel searches from SEQUEST HT, Mascot, and MS Amanda 2.0 search engines against the database (selected for Rattus norvegicus reviewed entries only). Parameters were set as follows: Enzyme: Trypsin (full), Max missed cleavage: 2, peptide mass tolerance: ±10 PPM (MS1), ± 0.02 Da (MS2), Fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl (C), Dynamic modifications: Acetyl (protein N-term), Oxidation (M), GG (K). The identification results were statistically filtered through Percolator and GG site probabilities were calculated by inbuilt IMP-ptmRS node.
