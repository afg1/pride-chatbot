### Title
LINC00955 Suppresses Colorectal Cancer Growth by Acting as a Molecular Scaffold of TRIM25 and Sp1 to Inhibit DNMT3B-mediated Methylation of the PHIP Promoter——iTRAQ

### Description
ITRAQ quantitative methods HCT116 (Vector) and HCT116 (LINC00955) compare the relative content of proteins in these two cells

### Sample Protocol
The main steps of the iTRAQ proteomics experiment are shown in the figure below, including protein extraction, quantification, electrophoresis to detect protein quality, enzymolysis, labeling and mixing, High pH reverse phase chromatography (peptide fractionation), liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and finally obtaining the original mass spectrometry data (raw file)

### Data Protocol
(1) Search the database of the offline file (. raw) of proteomics to obtain the search table of proteins and peptides;  (2) The basic statistical analysis of the detection results of proteins and peptides, including the Mass distribution of protein relative molecules, the distribution of isoelectric points of identified proteins, etc;  (3) According to the relative quantitative results of proteins in proteomics, differential proteins were screened.  (4) Conduct bioinformatics analysis on differential proteins, including GO annotation, classification and enrichment analysis, KEGG path annotation analysis, path analysis and enrichment analysis, and String analysis.
