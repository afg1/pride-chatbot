### Title
bofilm samples of Staphylococcus aureus

### Description
We have collected biofilm cells of MRSA USA300 JE2 and gltS transposon mutant

### Sample Protocol
Centrifuged cell pellets were lyzed with urea buffer and sonication. Supernatants were collected and extracted proteins were reduced and alkylated. Lysates were trypsinized and desalted, and then injected onto a reverse phase capillary HPLC column.

### Data Protocol
MS data were acquired by using Dionex Ultimate 3000 SRSLCnano and analyzed by MaxQuant software with the integrated Andromeda search engine against the RefSeq protein database for USA300_RPR3757.
