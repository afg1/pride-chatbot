Identification of proteins interacting with recombinant Arabidopsis Legumain-beta

### Description
Pull down assay with recombinant AtLEGbeta to identify interaction partners

### Sample Protocol
Pull-down assay with recombinant AtLEGβ For pulldown experiments with recombinant AtLEGβ, VPE0 mutant (accession N67918) seed stocks were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC, Nottingham, UK) and grown on soil at short day conditions (9 h light with an intensity of 120 μE m−2 s−1 at 22 °C and 15 h darkness at 18 °C, 75 % RH) after stratification for 3d at 4 °C. Leaves of 5-week-old plants were harvested and homogenized using a Polytron PT-2500 (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland) in extraction buffer (100 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 % Triton X-100, and HALT protease inhibitor cocktail; ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany) followed by centrifugation at 4000 g, 4 °C for 5 minutes. The lysate was then quantified using the BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany). A total of 2 mg of lysate per condition together with 25 μL of DynabeadsTM for His-Tag isolation (Invitrogen) were incubated with His6-AtLEGβ or the His6-proAtLEGβ-C211A dead mutant or lysate alone for an hour at room temperature with rotation. To block its proteolytic activity, His6-AtLEGβ was pre-inhibited with MMTS. The Dynabeads were then washed four times with 400 μL of wash buffer (100 mM MES pH 6.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 % Triton X-100). Elution was performed in 100 μL of elution buffer (300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 % Triton X-100). For sample processing prior to mass spectrometry measurement, each eluted fraction was then heated to 56 °C for 10 minutes followed by reduction with 20 mM DTT for a further 30 minutes under shaking conditions at 1500 rpm and alkylation with 50 mM CAA (chloroacetamide) at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. The reaction was quenched with 50 mM DTT for 30 minutes and purified with SP3 beads. For each reaction, 5 μL of SP3 bead stock (1:1 mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carboxylated beads, 1 µL per 20 µg of protein) was added and protein binding to the beads was induced with a final concentration of 80 % ethanol followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes with rotation. The beads were then washed twice with 90 % acetonitrile before being resuspended in trypsin solution (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2, 1 μg trypsin) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 hours at 1500 rpm. For triplex differential labelling of the peptides, the conditions were labelled with 30 mM light, CH2O (lysate alone), medium, CD2O (AtLEGβ), heavy, 13CD2O (proAtLEGβ-C211A) and 15 mM sodium cyanoborohydride at 37 °C for one hour, 1500 rpm. The reaction was then quenched with 100 mM Tris for 30 minutes. The labelled peptides from the three conditions were pooled 1:1:1 and acidified with final 1 % formic acid trifluoroacetic acid before passing through pre-activated C18 StageTips.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry analysis of pulldown samples AtLEGβ pulldown assays were analyzed on a two-column nano-HPLC setup (Ultimate 3000 nano-RSLC, Thermo) equipped with Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 columns (ID 75 μm, particle size 3 μm columns, trap column of 2 cm length, analytical column of 50 cm length, Thermo) operated at 60°C. Peptides were eluted with a binary gradient from 5–32.5% B for 80 min (A: H2O + 0.1% FA, B: ACN + 0.1% FA) and a total runtime of 2 h per sample. Spectra were acquired in data-dependent data acquisition mode using a high-resolution Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Impact II, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) as described by Soh et al Anal Chem 2021.  Mass spectrometry data analysis Tandem mass spectra acquired for AtLEGβ pulldown assays were analyzed with the MaxQuant software package, v1.6.0.16, with the Uniprot Arabidopsis thaliana reference proteome database (release 2019_03) with appended sequence of recombinant proAtLEGβ-C211A and list of common contaminants included in MaxQuant. Searches considered tryptic digest with up to 2 missed cleavages, Met oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications and triplex stable isotope labeling of peptide N-termini and Lys residues with light formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride (+28.0313 Da), deuterated formaldehyde (12CD2O) and sodium cyanoborohydride (+32.0564 Da) and 13CD2O formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborodeuteride (+36.0756 Da). Standard settings for Bruker QTOF data were used with standard settings for protein identification including PSM and protein FDR<0.01.
