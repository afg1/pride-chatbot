### Title
comparative mass spectrometry analysis of the PARP1 and PAR-PARP1 interactomes

### Description
To investigate the functional outcome of PARP1 activation, we performed a pull-down assay coupled with comparative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify proteins that are specifically associated with PAR-PARP1.

### Sample Protocol
The Strep-tagged PARP1 affinity-purified from HeLa cells first underwent auto-PARylation in vitro to generate activated PAR-PARP1. Both unmodified- and PAR-PARP1 immobilized on Strep-Tactin beads were then incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts (NE) to capture associated proteins for MS identification

### Data Protocol
The data were analyzed by Maxquant V2.0.3.0 and searched against the human proteome database. The relative level of each hit was further quantified by label-free mode
