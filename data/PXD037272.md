### Title
Human Prostate Cancer epithelial-fibroblast cell signalling by CTAP-MS

### Description
A greater understanding of cell signaling events that occur within the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment (TME), for example between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and prostate epithelial or cancer cells, may identify novel biomarkers and more effective therapeutic strategies for this disease. To address this, we used cell-type specific labelling with amino acid precursors (CTAP) to define cell type-specific phosphoproteomic changes that occur when prostate epithelial cells are co-cultured with normal patient-derived prostate fibroblasts (NPFs) versus matched CAFs.

### Sample Protocol
BPH-1 cells were infected with pGIPZ lentivirus (Thermo Scientific) for GFP expression, and CAF/NPF cells were infected with pMSCV-pBabeMCS-IRES-RFP retrovirus (33337, Addgene, Cambridge, MA) for RFP expression and isolated using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (DDCM.tub-KDEL) (P0A5M4) diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DDC) and Proteus mirabilis lysine racemase (LyrM37-KDEL) (M4GGR9) were synthesized by GeneArt. BPH-1 cells were transfected with LyrM37-KDEL while CAF/NPF cells were transfected with DDCM.tub-KDEL. BPH-1+LyrM37-KDEL and CAF/NPF+DDCM.tub-KDEL cells. Transfection was confirmed with western blot analysis. All cells were grown in DMEM (deficient for L-lysine and L-arginine) (DMP49, Caisson, Utah) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) and 0.3 mM L-arginine (A8094, Sigma). BPH-1+LyrM37-KDEL cells were grown with 2.5 mM heavy D-lysine-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-d8 2HCl (C/D/N D-6367). CAF/NPF+DDCM.tub-KDEL cells were grown with 5 mM light diaminopimelate (DAP) for 5 days. Concomitantly to investigate reciprocal signaling in co-culture, “heavy” BPH-1+LyrM37-KDEL cells were co-cultured with “light” CAF-/orNPF+DDCM.tub-KDEL cells in a 10:1 seed ratio. After 5 days, each monoculture and co-culture condition were washed 2x with 1xTBS, lysed with 4% sodium deoxycholate (w/v) in 100 mM TEAB (ph 8-8.5), immediately heated for 5 mins at 95°C to facilitate lysis and inactivate endogenous proteases and phosphatases. Lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10 mins@ 4°C to clear cell debris, and protein concentration was determined by BCA. One hundred micrograms of each sample was reduced with 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at 55°C for 30 mins, alkylation with 20mM Chloroacetamide in the dark for 30min, and digestion with Lys-C and trypsin (1:100) O/N at 37°C with shaking (1,500 rpm). Tryptic digests were acidified with 10% TFA to pH 2-3 and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 mins @ 4°C. SDC was removed and supernatant was TMT labeled before being combined and desalted with a C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/40% acetonitrile (ACN). Peptides were dried with a SpeedVac and re-suspended in 2% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA) prior to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Samples were analysed on an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded via an Acclaim PepMap 100 trap column (100μm x 2cm, nanoViper, C18, 5μm, 100Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1μg of peptides as measured by a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was laoded on the pre-column with microliter pickup. Peptides were eluted using a 2h linear gradient of 80% ACN/0.1% FA flowing at 250nL/min using a mobile phase gradient of 2.5%-42.5% ACN. The eluting peptides were interrogated using synchronous precursor selection tandem MS/MS/MS (SPS-MS3) workflow, to eliminate isolation interference and dynamic range compression that are commonly observed in isobaric tag-based quantitative proteomics experiments. For peptide identification, raw data files were analysed with the MaxQuant Version 1.6.0.16 analysis software using default settings. Group-specific parameters was set to Type Reporter ion MS3 and TMT labels loaded under isobaric labels. Enzyme specificity was set to Trypsin/P and LysC/P, minimal peptide length of 6, and up to 4 missed cleavages were allowed. Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed medication; oxidation methionine; acetyl (protein N terminus); deamidation (NQ); custom “heavy” deuterated lysine-d8 modification (+8.05021396); and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine as variable modifications. The mass tolerance for the precursors was 4.5ppm and for the fragment ions was 20ppm. The DDA files were searched against the human UniProt fasta database (v2015-08, 20, 210 entries concatenated with DDCM.tub-KDEL and LyrM37-KDEL peptides). Only lysine containing peptides were included in the CTAP quantitative analysis.

### Data Protocol
Peptide intensities were Log2 transformed, imputation via normal distribution with Perseus software before quantile normalization. A FC of co-culture/monoculture of over 2 in either direction and a P-value < 0.05 was the criteria for differential expression. Differential proteins observed across all three replicates were further examined.

### Publication Abstract
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in males. A greater understanding of cell signalling events that occur within the prostate cancer tumour microenvironment (TME), for example, between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and prostate epithelial or cancer cells, may identify novel biomarkers and more effective therapeutic strategies for this disease. To address this, we used cell-type-specific labelling with amino acid precursors (CTAP) to define cell-type-specific (phospho)proteomic changes that occur when prostate epithelial cells are co-cultured with normal patient-derived prostate fibroblasts (NPFs) versus matched CAFs. We report significant differences in the response of BPH-1 benign prostate epithelial cells to CAF versus NPF co-culture. Pathway analysis of proteomic changes identified significant upregulation of focal adhesion and cytoskeleton networks, and downregulation of metabolism pathways, in BPH-1 cells cultured with CAFs. In addition, co-cultured CAFs exhibited alterations in stress, DNA damage, and cytoskeletal networks. Functional validation of one of the top differentially-regulated proteins in BPH-1 cells upon CAF co-culture, transglutaminase-2 (TGM2), demonstrated that knockdown of this protein significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of prostate epithelial cells. Overall, this study provides novel insights into intercellular communication in the prostate cancer TME that may be exploited to improve patient management.
