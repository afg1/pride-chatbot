### Publication Abstract
Adipocyte differentiation is a general physiological process that is also critical for metabolic syndrome. In spite of extensive study in the past two decades, adipogenesis is a still complex cellular process that is accompanied by complicated molecular mechanisms. Here, we performed SILAC-based quantitative global proteomic profiling of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. We report protein changes to the proteome profiles, with 354 proteins exhibiting significant increase and 56 proteins showing decrease in our statistical analysis. Our results show that adipocyte differentiation is involved not only in metabolic processes by increasing TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, acetyl-CoA production, antioxidants, and electron transport, but also in nicotinamide metabolism, cristae formation, mitochondrial protein import, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport into mitochondria and ER. A search for Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) using neXtprot highlighted one protein with a protein existence uncertain (PE5) and 17 proteins as functionally uncharacterized protein existence 1 (uPE1). This study provides quantitative information on proteome changes in adipogenic differentiation, which is helpful in improving our understanding of the processes of adipogenesis.
