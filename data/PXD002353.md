### Title
Quantitative proteomics Reveals Targets of Protein Kinase SnRK1 in Arabidopsis under Submergence

### Description
SNF1 RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (SnRK1) is proposed as a central integrator of regulatory pathways in plant stress and energy starvation signaling. We observed in this study that the Arabidopsis SnRK1.1 dominant negative mutant (SnRK1.1K48M) had lower tolerance to submergence than the wild-type, suggesting that SnRK1.1-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins is important in energy starvation signaling triggered by submergence. To gain further insight into submergence signaling mechanisms, we determined the temporal response to energy starvation through AMP/ATP quantification and used quantitative phosphoproteomics to compare the global changes in phosphopeptides in Col-0 and SnRK1.1K48M. We found that the phosphorylation levels of 59 peptides increased and the levels of 96 peptides decreased in Col-0 within 0.5�� h of submergence. Among the 59 peptides with increased phosphorylation in Col-0, 49 did not show increased phosphorylation levels in SnRK1.1K48M under submergence. These proteins are involved in sugar synthesis, glycolysis, osmotic regulation, ABA signaling, protein synthesis and ROS signaling. In particular, the phosphorylation of MAPK6, which is involved in regulating ROS responses under different abiotic stresses, was disrupted in the SnRK1.1K48M mutant. In addition, PTP1, a negative regulator of MAPK6 activity that directly dephosphorylates MAPK6, was also regulated by SnRK1.1. These results reveal insights into the function of SnRK1 and the downstream signaling factors of submergence.

### Sample Protocol
The protein extraction was performed according to (Lan et al., 2012). Total proteins were extracted from 9-d-old whole seedlings of Col-0 and SnRK1.1K48M treated with 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h and 3 h submergence. 100 mg 3 mg protein of each sample was reduced and alkylated by using dithiothreitol (DTT) and iodoacetamide (IAA), and the DNA and RNA in the sample were degraded by mixing with benzonase nuclease (Novagen) at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The peptide solution was further incubated with modified trypsin (Promega) at room temperature overnight. The resulting peptide solution was acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). For total proteome quantitative analysis, the desalted peptide samples from Col-0 with different treatments were labeled 113-116, and samples from SnRK1.1K48M with different treatments were labeled with reagent 117-121, respectively. The labeling reaction was processed at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the labeled samples were combined and fractionated offline using strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX, Polysulfoethyl A, 5 弮m, 200-� bead, 4.6 � 100 mm) on HPLC.  The SCX was performed with a 20-min linear gradient from 0% to 40% of buffer B containing 1 M KCl in buffer A (10 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.65, and 25% Acetonitrile) at a flow rate of l ml/min.  Fractions were collected and pooled into 22 final fractions according to the peak area. Each final fraction was desalted and lyophilized in a centrifugal speed vacuum concentrator. Samples were stored at -80簞C before reconstitution in solution for MS analysis. peptide mixtures were separated on C18 BEH130 column and electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer under the same conditions as mentioned above. Full scan MS spectra (m/z 350��600) were also acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a target value of 500,000. The 15 most intense peptide ions with charge states �� were sequentially isolated to a target value of 50,000 and fragmented in the HCD cell with normalized collision energy of 35%. The resulting fragment ions were scanned in the Orbitrap analyzer. The ion selection threshold was 5,000 counts for MS/MS, and the maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 10 ms for full scans and 100 ms for HCD-MS/MS. Three independent biological experiments with two technical repeats each were performed.

### Data Protocol
The Proteome Discoverer software (ver. 1.3, Thermo Scientific) with integrated SEQUEST database search algorithm and an in-house version of Mascot (ver. 2.3, Matrix Science) accessed via the internet were used for protein identification, phosphorylation modification, and quantitative analyses. MS data were searched against the Arabidopsis protein database, TAIR10, downloaded from the Arabidopsis Information Resource Center website (http://www.arabidopsis.org/).  The parameters for database searches were set as follows: full trypsin digestion with 2 maximum missed cleavage sites, precursor mass tolerance = 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance = 50 mmu, dynamic modification: oxidation (M) and static modifications: carbamidomethyl (C) and 8plex-iTRAQ (N-terminus and K), and dynamic phosphorylation (S, T, and Y) for phosphorylation modification analysis. The identified peptides were validated using Percolator algorithm, which automatically conducted target and decoy database searches and rescored peptide spectrum matches (PSM) using q-values and posterior error probabilities. All PSMs were filtered with a q-value threshold of 0.01 (1% false discovery rate).  For iTRAQ quantification, the ratios of iTRAQ reporter ion intensities in MS/MS spectra from raw datasets were used to calculate the fold changes between control and treatment.  Only unique peptides were used for peptide/protein quantitation. The protein ratio was calculated from three biological replicates.

### Publication Abstract
SNF1 RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (SnRK1) is proposed to be a central integrator of the plant stress and energy starvation signalling pathways. We observed that the Arabidopsis SnRK1.1 dominant negative mutant (SnRK1.1 (K48M) ) had lower tolerance to submergence than the wild type, suggesting that SnRK1.1-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins is important in signalling pathways triggered by submergence. We conducted quantitative phosphoproteomics and found that the phosphorylation levels of 57 proteins increased and the levels of 27 proteins decreased in Col-0 within 0.5-3h of submergence. Among the 57 proteins with increased phosphorylation in Col-0, 38 did not show increased phosphorylation levels in SnRK1.1 (K48M) under submergence. These proteins are involved mainly in sugar and protein synthesis. In particular, the phosphorylation of MPK6, which is involved in regulating ROS responses under abiotic stresses, was disrupted in the SnRK1.1 (K48M) mutant. In addition, PTP1, a negative regulator of MPK6 activity that directly dephosphorylates MPK6, was also regulated by SnRK1.1. We also showed that energy conservation was disrupted in SnRK1.1 (K48M) , mpk6, and PTP1 (S7AS8A) under submergence. These results reveal insights into the function of SnRK1 and the downstream signalling factors related to submergence.
