### Title
A proteome scale study reveals how plastic surfaces and agitation promote protein aggregation

### Description
Protein aggregation in biotherapeutics can reduce their activity and effectiveness. It may also promote immune reactions responsible for severe adverse effects. The impact of plastic materials on protein destabilization is not totally understood. Here, we propose to deconvolve the effects of material surface, air/liquid interface, and agitation to decipher their respective role in protein destabilization and aggregation. We analyzed the effect of polypropylene, Teflon, glass and LoBindTM surfaces on the stability of purified proteins (BSA, hemoglobin and α-synuclein) and on a cell extract composed of 6,000 soluble proteins during agitation (P = 0.1-1.2 W/kg). Proteomic analysis revealed that chaperonins, intrinsically disordered proteins and ribosomes were more sensitive to the combined effect of material surfaces and agitation while small metabolic oligomers could be protected in the same conditions. Protein loss observations coupled to Raman microscopy, dynamic light scattering and proteomics allowed us to propose a mechanistic model of protein destabilization by plastics. Our results suggests that protein loss is not primarily due to the nucleation of small aggregates in solution, but to the destabilization of proteins exposed to material surfaces and their subsequent aggregation at the sheared air/liquid interface, an effect that cannot be prevented by using LoBind tubes. A guidance can be established on how to minimize these adverse effects. Remove one of the components of this combined stress – material, air (even partially), or agitation – and proteins will be preserved.

### Data Protocol
The protein identification was performed using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein database (uniport-Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_S288c_6750entries_14112020.fasta). The method followed was adapted from 2 in order to obtain  a semi absolute quantification. Quantification below 5 fmol were not considered as reliable. The variations of protein abundance were obtained by comparison with a reference sample exposed to the plastic, but not agitated.To evaluate the specificity of the protein adsorbed on the polypropylene surface we developed the following Monte-Carlo simulation framework.  Beforehand, we made these hypotheses: 1) if the mass depletion effect is non-specific, proteins in the cellular extract should be uniformly depleted; 2) proteins abundances (Qabs) are estimated using the semi-quantitative method described in 2; 3) protein abundance variability used for simulations are estimated using the experimental deviations of the four technical replicates. The overall simulation strategy is depicted in Figure S6. The goal is to generate four replicates, starting from the four samples of full YPE shotgun quantification, that were depleted to a target mass loss of τ %. For each protein detected by LC-MS/MS: 1) we calculated the semi quantitative index Qabs for each of the four replicates; 2) these concentration measurements were converted into molecule sets of size N = Qabs x Avocoef where Avocoef = 5.106 is an Avogadro like number; 3) these molecule sets (one per protein) were randomly sampled and the size of the set decreased by one unit. This sampling process was repeated until an overall mass loss of τ% is obtained. 4) Then, down sampled molecule sets were converted back to the semi quantitative index Qabs. 5) For each protein, the Qabs values of the four full YPE replicates and the four simulated molecule set replicates were compared using a Bayesian version of the t-test 3. The overall process, from step 2 to 5, was repeated 100 times.

### Publication Abstract
Protein aggregation in biotherapeutics can reduce their activity and effectiveness. It may also promote immune reactions responsible for severe adverse effects. The impact of plastic materials on protein destabilization is not totally understood. Here, we propose to deconvolve the effects of material surface, air/liquid interface, and agitation to decipher their respective role in protein destabilization and aggregation. We analyzed the effect of polypropylene, TEFLON, glass and LOBIND surfaces on the stability of purified proteins (bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin and &#x3b1;-synuclein) and on a cell extract composed of 6000 soluble proteins during agitation (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1-1.2&#xa0;W/kg). Proteomic analysis revealed that chaperonins, intrinsically disordered proteins and ribosomes were more sensitive to the combined effects of material surfaces and agitation while small metabolic oligomers could be protected in the&#xa0;same&#xa0;conditions. Protein loss observations coupled to Raman microscopy, dynamic light scattering and proteomic allowed us to propose a mechanistic model of protein destabilization by plastics. Our results suggest that protein loss is not primarily due to the nucleation of small aggregates in solution, but to the destabilization of proteins exposed to material&#xa0;surfaces and their&#xa0;subsequent aggregation at the sheared air/liquid interface, an effect that cannot be prevented by using LOBIND tubes. A guidance can be established on how to minimize these adverse effects. Remove one of the components of this combined stress&#xa0;-&#xa0;material, air (even partially), or agitation&#xa0;-&#xa0;and proteins will be preserved.
