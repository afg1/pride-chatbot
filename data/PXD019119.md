### Title
Fast and low-cost detection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides by tandem mass spectrometry in clinical samples

### Description
We developed a high-throughput targeted proteomics assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins directly from clinical respiratory tract samples.

### Sample Protocol
Two hundred microliters of clinical specimens was transferred to 1.5-mL conical polypropylene tubes. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 5 volumes of ethanol, followed by storage at −80 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 4 °C, 14000 rpm for 15 min. Proteins were digested with trypsin using a modified single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) protocol.

### Data Protocol
Data-dependent acquisition raw files were processed by the MaxQuant software version 1.6.14 and searched against the UniProt SARS-CoV-2 pre-release (downloaded on March 13, 2020). Mass tolerance values for MS and MS/MS and the false discovery rate were set at 20 ppm and 1%, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. “Include contaminants” was left unchecked to not interrogate human proteins.
