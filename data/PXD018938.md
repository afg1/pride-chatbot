### Title
Analysis of circulating protein aggregates reveals pathological hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

### Description
the aim of the project is to characterise circulating protein aggregates and evaluate their protein composition in order to define new biomarkers of neurodegeneration in blood

### Sample Protocol
protein aggregates were isolated by ultracentrifugation using a sucrose cushion as described in Adiutori et al. 2018.

### Data Protocol
After aggregates were isolated the samples were run in a gel and gel bands were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion for following LC-MS/MS analysis
