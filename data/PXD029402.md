### Title
Allosteric control of Ubp6 and the proteasome via a bidirectional switch

### Description
The proteasome recognizes target proteins that have been covalently marked by ubiquitin chains. The ubiquitin signal is subject to rapid editing at the proteasome, allowing it to reject substrates based on topological features of their attached ubiquitin chains. Editing is mediated by a key regulator of the proteasome, deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6. The proteasome activates Ubp6, whereas Ubp6 inhibits the proteasome–both by deubiquitinating proteasome-bound ubiquitin conjugates, and through a noncatalytic effect that does not involve deubiquitination. We report mutants in both Ubp6 and proteasome subunit Rpt1 that abrogate Ubp6 activation. The Ubp6 mutations fall within its ILR element, defined here, which is conserved from yeast to mammals. The ILR is a component of the BL1 blocking loop, other parts of which obstruct ubiquitin access to the catalytic groove in free Ubp6. Rpt1 docking at the ILR opens the catalytic groove by rearranging not only BL1 but also a novel network of three directly interconnected active-site-blocking loops. Ubp6 activation and noncatalytic proteasome inhibition by Ubp6 are linked in that they were eliminated by the same Ubp6 and Rpt1 mutations. Ubp6 and ubiquitin together drive the proteasome into a unique conformational state associated with proteasome inhibition. Our results identify a multicomponent allosteric switch that exerts simultaneous control over the activity of both Ubp6 and the proteasome, and suggest that their active states are in general mutually exclusive.

### Sample Protocol
Deuterium labeling: To monitor exchange in the Regulatory Particle (RP), it was incubated in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol [v/v], H2O) alone or with a 5-fold molar excess of Ubp6-UbVME for 1 h on ice to allow for complex formation. To monitor exchange in Ubp6 and Ubp6-UbVME, His6-Ubp6 or His6-Ubp6 UbVME were incubated in storage buffer alone or with a 1.65-fold molar excess of proteasome base for 1 h on ice to allow for complex formation. Deuteration was initiated by a 12-fold dilution with labeling buffer (10 mM HEPES, pD 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol [v/v], 99.9% D2O [Cambridge Isotope Laboratories]) at 21 °C.  Labeling was allowed to proceed for various times (10 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours) and labeling was quenched with a 2-fold dilution with ice-cold quench buffer (0.8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.8% formic acid [v/v], pH 2.0, H2O). Undeuterated control samples were prepared for each of the proteins alone and in complexes using the same procedure as outlined above but using storage buffer in place of the labeling buffer.  LC/MS After the addition of quench buffer, samples were immediately digested offline with 10 μL of a 50% [v/v] slurry of immobilized porcine pepsin (prepared in house using POROS beads) for 5 min on ice, then spin-filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate membrane at 4 °C for 30 seconds at 10 000g. The flow-through was injected into a Waters M-class Acquity UPLC with HDX technology.  The cooling chamber of the UPLC system, which housed all the chromatographic elements, was held at 0.0 ± 0.1 °C for the duration of the measurements. Peptides were trapped and desalted on a VanGuard Pre-Column trap [2.1 mm × 5 mm, ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 μm (Waters, 186002346)] for 3 minutes at 100 μL/min, eluted from the trap using a 5%–35% gradient of acetonitrile over 18 minutes at a flow rate of 60 μL/min, and separated using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, 1.8 µm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm column (Waters, Part #186002346).  The back pressure averaged ~12,650 psi at 0 °C and 5% acetonitrile:95% water. A blank injection and run were performed between each sample to wash the trap column and analytical column. Mass spectra were acquired using a Waters Synapt G2-Si HDMSE mass spectrometer calibrated with direct infusion of a solution of glu-fibrinopeptide (Sigma, F3261) at 200 femtomoles/uL prior to data collection. A conventional electrospray source was used with a temperature of 80 °C and desolvation temperature of 175 °C. The instrument was scanned at 0.4 scans/second over the range 50 to 2000 m/z with ion mobility engaged, capillary voltage 3.2 kV, trap collision energy 4 V and sampling cone at 40 V. All comparison experiments were done under identical experimental conditions such that deuterium levels were not corrected for back-exchange and are therefore reported as relative. The error of determining the deuterium levels did not exceed ± 0.20 Da in this experimental setup.

### Data Protocol
Peptides were identified using PLGS 3.0.1 (Waters, RRID: SCR_016664, 720001408EN) using multiple replicates of undeuterated control samples. Peptides were identified by searching using non-specific cleavage of a custom FASTA database containing the sequences of all yeast 26S proteins and accessory proteins, indicated here with {protein name, UniProt code}: alpha1, P21243; alpha2, P23639; alpha3, P23638; alpha4, P40303; alpha5, P32379; alpha6, P40302; alpha7, P21242; beta1, P38624; beta2, P25043; beta3, P25451; beta4, P22141; beta5, P30656; beta6, P23724; beta7, P30657; Rpt1, P33299; Rpt2, P40327; Rpt3, P33298; Rpt4, P53549; Rpt5, P33297; Rpt6, Q01939; Rpn1, P38764; Rpn2, P32565; Rpn3, P40016; Rpn5, Q12250; Rpn6, Q12377; Rpn7, Q06103; Rpn8, Q08723; Rpn9, Q04062; Rpn10, P38886; Rpn11, P43588; Rpn12, P32496; Rpn13, O13563; Rpn14, P53196; Sem1, O94742; Hul5, P53119; Nas2, P40555; Nas6, P50086; Hsm3, P38348; Ubp6, P43593; Ubiquitin P62987.  Additional search parameters were: no missed cleavages, no PTMs, a low energy threshold of 250, an elevated energy threshold of 50 and an intensity threshold of 500. No false discovery rate (FDR) control was performed. The peptides identified in PLGS (excluding all neutral loss and in-source fragmentation identifications) were then filtered in DynamX 3.0 (Waters Corporation, 720005145EN) with the criteria shown in Supplementary Table S1 “HDX MS Data Summary and list of experimental parameters”.  Raw MS data for undeuterated controls and each labeling experiment were imported and processed automatically by DynamX followed by manual inspection of all processing. The relative amount of deuterium in each peptide was determined by subtracting the centroid mass of the undeuterated form of each peptide from the deuterated form, at each time point, for each condition.

### Publication Abstract
The proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and can also edit ubiquitin marks, allowing substrates to be rejected based on ubiquitin chain topology. In yeast, editing is mediated by deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6. The proteasome activates Ubp6, whereas Ubp6 inhibits the proteasome through deubiquitination and a noncatalytic effect. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the proteasome bound to Ubp6, based on which we identify mutants in Ubp6 and proteasome subunit Rpt1 that abrogate Ubp6 activation. The Ubp6 mutations define a conserved region that we term the ILR element. The ILR is found within the BL1 loop, which obstructs the catalytic groove in free Ubp6. Rpt1-ILR interaction opens the groove by rearranging not only BL1 but also a previously undescribed&#xa0;network of three interconnected active-site-blocking loops. Ubp6 activation and noncatalytic proteasome inhibition are linked in that they are eliminated by the same mutations. Ubp6 and ubiquitin together drive proteasomes into a unique conformation associated with proteasome inhibition. Thus, a multicomponent allosteric switch exerts simultaneous control over both Ubp6 and the proteasome.
