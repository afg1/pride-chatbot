### Title
Proteomic responses of Lentibacter algarum HYO3 to DOC amendments

### Description
The proteomic datasets were generated from Lentibacter algarum HYO3 grown with in situ DOC from bloom in mid-exponential and late stationary phase.

### Sample Protocol
Protein quantification for nano LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptide mixture was loaded onto a reverse phase trap column（Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, 100 μm×2 cm, nanoViper C18）connected to the C18-reversed phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific Easy Column, 10 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter, 3 μm resin).

### Data Protocol
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) that was coupled to Easy nLC (Proxeon Biosystems, now Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant software version1.5.3.17 (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany).
