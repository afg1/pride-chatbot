### Title
Tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)

### Description
The branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway and high levels of BCAA transaminase 1 (BCAT1) have recently been associated with aggressiveness in several cancer entities. However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely uncertain. Here, by performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem-cell and non-stem-cell populations, we find the BCAA pathway enriched and BCAT1 protein and transcripts overexpressed in leukaemia stem cells. We show that BCAT1, which transfers α-amino groups from BCAAs to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), is a critical regulator of intracellular αKG homeostasis. Further to its role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, αKG is an essential cofactor for αKG-dependent dioxygenases such as Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA demethylases. Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of αKG, leading to EGLN1-mediated HIF1α protein degradation. This resulted in a growth and survival defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. By contrast, overexpression of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular αKG levels and caused DNA hypermethylation through altered TET activity. AML with high levels of BCAT1 (BCAT1high) displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying a mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHmut), in which TET2 is inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate11,12. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with shorter overall survival in IDHWTTET2WT, but not IDHmut or TET2mutAML. Gene sets characteristic for IDHmut AML13 were enriched in samples from patients with an IDHWTTET2WTBCAT1high status. BCAT1highAML showed robust enrichment for leukaemia stem-cell signatures14,15, and paired sample analysis showed a significant increase in BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular αKG, BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1α stability and regulation of the epigenomic landscape, mimicking the effects of IDH mutations. Our results suggest the BCAA–BCAT1–αKG pathway as a therapeutic target to compromise leukaemia stem-cell function in patients with IDHWTTET2WT AML.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation for proteome analysis Cell pellets corresponding to 5x105 FACS-sorted cells were lysed with 0.1% RapiGest (Waters) in 60 µl 200 mM HEPES (pH 8), then heated at 90 ºC for 5 minutes, followed by sonication for 20 minutes and removal of cell debris by centrifugation. Cysteine disulfide bonds were reduced with 5 mM DTT for 30 minutes at 56 ºC, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and proteins were digested with Mass Spectrometry Grade Lysyl Endopeptidase (Wako) at enzyme:protein ratio 1:50, at 37 ºC overnight. Peptides were differentially labeled with Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling (TMT 6-plex, Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 0.8 mg TMT reagents were dissolved in 40 µl acetonitrile and 5 µl dissolved reagent was added to each sample. After 30 minutes, another 5 µl reagent was added and the samples were left for another 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched by adding 8 µl of 5% hydroxylamine and incubating for 15 minutes. RapiGest was precipitated by addition of 5 µl 10% TFA and incubation at 37 ºC for 45 minutes. Following centrifugation supernatants were collected and protein digests were stored at -20 ºC until further use.  High-pH reversed phase analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system equipped with a variable wavelength detector (254nm). Fractionation was performed on an XBridge BEH C18 column (1 x 100mm, 3.5 μm, 130Å, Waters) using a gradient of mobile phase A (20mM ammonium formate, pH 10) and B (acetonitrile). 32 fractions were collected across the entire gradient length and combined into 16 final samples of similar peptide amount. Fractions were dried in a SpeedVac centrifuge and reconstituted in 4%ACN/0.1% formic acid prior to MS analysis.  MS analysis MS analyses were carried out on an Orbitrap Velos Pro MS system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nanoAcquity UltraPerformance LC system (Waters). Injected peptides were trapped on a Symmetry C18 column (5µm particle size, 180 µm inner diameter x 20 mm length). After trapping, gradient elution of peptides was performed on a C18 column (nanoAcquity BEH C18, 1.7µm particle size, 75µm inner diameter x 200 mm length). The outlet of the analytical column was coupled directly to the mass spectrometer using a Proxeon nanospray source. The mobile phases for LC separation were 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in LC-MS grade water (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in ACN (solvent B). Peptides were first loaded with a constant flow of solvent A at 15 μl/min onto the trapping column. Trapping time was 2 minutes. Subsequently, peptides were eluted via the analytical column at a constant flow of 300 nl/min. During the elution step, the percentage of solvent B increased in a linear fashion from 3% to 7% in 10 minutes, then increased to 25% in 100 minutes and finally to 40% in a further 10 minutes. The peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a Pico-Tip Emitter 360 µm OD x 20 µm ID; 10 µm tip (New Objective) and a spray voltage of 2.2 kV was applied. The capillary temperature was set at 230 °C. Data acquisition was carried out using a data-dependent MS3 method. The survey scan was performed in the Orbitrap in the range of 300–1700m/z at a resolution of 30,000 (at m/z 400). The filling time was set at maximum of 500 ms with limitation of 106 ions. The survey scan was followed by the selection of the seven most intense ions (top 7) for ion trap CID-MS2 at a precursor ion isolation width of 2 m/z. Directly after each MS2 experiment, the most intense fragment ion in an m/z range 400-800 was selected for HCD-MS3. MS3 scans were acquired at a resolution of 15,000. Normalized collision energy was set to 40% and 55% for MS2 and MS3 scans, respectively. In order to improve the mass accuracy, a lock mass correction using a background ion (m/z 445.12003) was applied.

### Data Protocol
MS data analysis MS raw data files were processed with Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific). Enzyme was set to LysC and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Tandem mass tag (TMT) modifications 'TMT-K' and 'TMT N-term' were set as static modifications. The data was searched using Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) against the Uniprot human database (downloaded 2013.03.01) containing 133,512 proteins to which 247 frequently observed contaminants had been added. Maximal allowed precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm. A 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was required at both the protein level and the peptide level. Statistical analysis was performed using the Limma package in R/Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004; Smyth 2004). After fitting a linear model to the data, an empirical Bayes moderated t-test was used for the protein ratios. P-values were then adjusted for multiple testing with Benjamini and Hochberg's method.
