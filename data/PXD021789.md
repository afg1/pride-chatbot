### Title
The AMBRA1 E3 ligase adaptor regulates Cyclin D protein stability

### Description
Here we describe AMBRA1 as the main regulator of Cyclin D protein degradation. We first identify AMBRA1 as the top candidate in a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screen investigating the genetic basis of resistance to chemical CDK4/6 inhibition. AMBRA1 loss results in high protein levels of CyclinÂ D in cells and in mice. AMBRA1 loss further promotes lung cancer development in a mouse model, and low levels of AMBRA1 correlate with worse survival in lung cancer patients. Mechanistically, AMBRA1 acts as a substrate receptor for the Cullin 4 E3 ligase complex to promote ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the three CyclinÂ D family members. Thus, AMBRA1 regulates Cyclin D protein levels and contributes to the development of cancer as well as the response of cancer cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were prepared using PreOmics iST sample preparation kit (PreOmics P.O.00001) as instructed by the kitâ€™s protocol. Prepared samples were dried using a SpeedVac and resuspended in Solution A (2% ACN, 0.1% FA in UHPLC-MS grade water). Sample concentrations were quantified using Quantitative Colorimetry Peptide Assay (ThermoFischer 23275) and diluted to 100 ng/Âµl.

### Data Protocol
Bruker raw datafiles were processed using Byonic software (Protein Metrics, Inc) to identify peptides and proteins using the NCBI Homo sapiens protein database. Data were searched with 20 ppm error tolerance for presursor and 40 ppm for fragment ions using QTOF/HCD fragmentation type. Besides standard variable modifications, we searched for S/T/Y phosphorylation and set 1 % FDR for protein identifications.

### Publication Abstract
The initiation of cell division integrates a large number of intra- and extracellular inputs. D-type cyclins (hereafter, cyclin&#xa0;D) couple these inputs to the initiation of DNA replication<sup>1</sup>. Increased levels of cyclin&#xa0;D promote cell division by activating cyclin-dependent kinases&#xa0;4 and 6 (hereafter, CDK4/6), which in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor. Accordingly, increased levels and activity of cyclin&#xa0;D-CDK4/6 complexes are strongly linked to unchecked cell proliferation and cancer<sup>2,3</sup>. However, the mechanisms that regulate levels of cyclin&#xa0;D are incompletely understood<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we show that autophagy and beclin&#xa0;1 regulator&#xa0;1 (AMBRA1) is the main regulator of the degradation of cyclin&#xa0;D. We identified AMBRA1 in a genome-wide screen to investigate the genetic basis of &#xa0;the response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Loss of AMBRA1 results in high levels of cyclin&#xa0;D in cells and in mice, which promotes proliferation and decreases sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. Mechanistically, AMBRA1 mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin&#xa0;D as a substrate receptor for the cullin&#xa0;4 E3 ligase complex. Loss of AMBRA1 enhances the growth of lung adenocarcinoma in a mouse model, and low levels of AMBRA1 correlate with worse survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, AMBRA1 regulates cellular levels of cyclin&#xa0;D, and contributes to cancer development and the response of cancer cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors.
