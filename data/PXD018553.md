### Title
Proteome of "Candidatus Kuenenia Stuttgartiensis" strain CSTR1 growing planctonically in semi-CSTR reactor

### Description
The dataset provides the whole proteome of the anammox bacterium "Candidatus Kuenenia Stuttgartiensis" strain CSTR1 growing planctonically in semi-CSTR reactor. The bacteria were growing at high growth rate (0.33 d-1) (reactor HRT 3d).

### Sample Protocol
Cells were harvested from the reactor vessel in biological triplicates. Cells were then pelleted at 5000g for 10min. Cell pellets were trypsin digested, and ziptip desalted, before loaded onto nano-LC equipted with an Orbitrap-Fusion. Proteins from an average of 3e6 cells were injected per injection. MS1 and MS2 were both using Orbitrap as detector, at resolution of 120k and 60k, respectively. Ions of charges 2-4 were selected for fragmentation.

### Data Protocol
Data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 with Sequest HT as the search engine. A fasta file containing all protein sequences from the genome of strain CSTR1 was used for peptide search. Maximal 2 cleavages were allowed. Protein abundances were quantified using precursor ion intensity with the Minora node in Proteome Discoverer.
