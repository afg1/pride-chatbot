### Title
Proteomic profiling of serum extracellular vesicles identifies diagnostic markers for echinococcosis

### Description
In the present study, we employed a proteomics approach to identify parasite-derived proteins in the serum EVs from E. multilocularis-infected mice and assessed their diagnostic values. The study paves the way for the use of EVs to identify of diagnostic candidates and potentiates the applications of TER ATPase and TPx-1 in the early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of echinococcosis.

### Sample Protocol
Whole blood samples were collected for serum isolation.  Mouse sera were collected by centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 min and mixed thre separate serum pools from the 10 sera in the E. multilocularis-infected group and in the uninfected group, respectively.

### Data Protocol
Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we profiled the serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)of E. multilocularis-infected mice.
