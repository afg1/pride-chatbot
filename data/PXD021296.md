### Title
Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Antibody-Epitope Peptide Complex Dissociation: Theoretical Concept and Practical Procedure of Binding Strength Characterization

### Description
We describe theoretical concepts and explain practical procedures of an electrospray mass spectrometry method, termed “Intact Transmission Epitope Mapping – Thermodynamic Weak-force Order (ITEM-TWO)”,  by which can be determined apparent binding energies and dissociation constants of immune complex dissociation reactions in the gas phase.  The protocol was developed using natural protein-ligand complexes (myoglobin and RNAse S) and was tested with two immune complexes  (FLAG peptide - antiFLAG antibody and Troponin I epitope peptide - anti-Troponin I antibody). ITEM-TWO is a rapid method which requires very little sample consumption for identification of protein  bound ligands and for determination of the gas phase protein-ligand complex binding strength.

### Sample Protocol
For each measurement 3 ul of the 0.25 ug/ul myoglobin solution in 200 mM ammonium acetate were loaded into self-prepared gold coated nanoESI capillaries  using a microloader pipette tip (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and were electro-sprayed directly without further purification. For nanoESI mass spectrometry of RNAse S 2.5 ul of the purified protein solution were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/µl with 7.5 ul of 10 % MeOH in 200mM ammonium acetate.  For each measurement 3 uL of RNAse S-containing solution were loaded into one nanoESI capillary. 5 ul of antiFLAG antibody solution (0.2 ug/ul; 1.33 uM in 200 mM ammonium acetate) was mixed with 1.5 ul of a peptide mixture of seven peptides containing 10 uM, each, of GPI peptide, FLAG peptide,  Angiotensin II, TRIM21A peptide, TRIM21B peptide, TRIM21C peptide, and RA33 peptide in molar ratios of 2.2 : 1 of peptide to antibody; dissolved in 200mM ammonium acetate. For each measurement 3 uL  of antibody-peptide complex-containing solution were loaded into one nanoESI capillary. To obtain the immune complex of Troponin I epitope peptide - anti-Troponin I antibody 4 µl of the antiTroponin I antibody solution (0.1125 uM) in 200 mM ammonium acetate were  mixed with 1.4 uL of the Troponin I peptide solution with 0.0131 ug/uL in 200 mM ammonium acetate. The immune complex-containing mixture was incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h.  For each measurement 3 uL of antibody-peptide complex-containing solution were loaded into one nanoESI capillary. When using a Q-TOF 2 instrument (Waters MS-Technologies, Manchester, UK) ITEM-TWO measurements were performed with the following instrumental settings: source temperature, 50C; capillary voltage,  1.3kV; sample cone voltage, 30V; extractor cone voltage, 3V; collision voltage, 4V; pusher time, 124us. The Quadrupole and ToF analyzer pressures were typically between ca. 2.0x10E–5mbar and 2.50x10E–7mbar,  respectively. When using a Synapt G2S instrument (Waters MS-Technologies, Manchester, UK) ITEM-TWO measurements were performed with the following instrumental settings: source temperature, 50C;  capillary voltage, 1.8 kV; sample cone voltage, 110 V; source off set voltage, 110 V; trap gas flow, 8.0 mL/min; cone gas flow, 100 L/h. All mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode  applying a mass window of m/z 200–8000. The quadrupole analyzer was used to block transmission of lower molecular weight ions: M1 = 4000 with dwell time of 25% and ramp time of 25%; M2 = 5000 with dwell  time of 25% and ramp time of 25%; M3 = 6000. The surviving antibody-peptide complexes were dissociated in the first collision cell (TRAP).

### Data Protocol
For nano ESI mass spectra of holo-myoglobin and RNAse S the Savitzky-Golay method was used for smoothing in 5 cycles with a window of 10 for the high mass range and in 3 cycles  with a window of 5 for the low mass range. Three myoglobin raw datasets were acquired with the Q-TOF 2 instrument. The collision cell voltage difference was increased as follows  in the first data set (04122017_MYOGLOBIN_NATIVE_DIL_1); 4V: 0-2 min, 20V: 2-3 min, 30V: 4-6 min, 40V: 6-8 min, 45V: 8-10 min, 50V: 10-12 min, 60V: 12-14 min, 80V: 14-16 min, 100V:  16-18 min, 120V: 18-21 min, 150V: 21-23 min, 170V: 23-25 min, 200V: 25-27 min. In the second data set (04122017_MYOGLOBIN_NATIVE_DIL), the collision cell voltage difference was  increased as follows; 20V: 9-12 min, 30V: 12-15 min, 40V: 15-18 min, 45V: 18-21 min, 50V: 21-24 min, 55V: 24-27 min, 60V: 27-30 min, 80V: 30-33 min, 100V: 33-36 min, 120V: 36-39 min,  150V: 39-42 min, 170V: 42-45 min, 200V: 45-48 min. The third set (04122017_MYOGLOBIN_NATIVE_DIL_2) was acquired with the following collision cell voltage difference time windows; 4V: 0-2 min,  20V: 2-4 min, 30V: 4-6 min, 40V: 6-8 min, 45V: 8-10 min, 50V: 10-12 min, 55V: 12-14 min, 60V: 14-16 min, 80V: 16-18 min, 100V: 18-20 min, 120V: 20-22 min, 150V: 22-24 min, 170V: 24-26 min, 200V: 26-28 min. Three RNAse S datasets were acquired and individual scans were accumulated to generate spectra at the respective collisional cell voltage differences: first set (081018_RNAse_S_2):  scans 878-1053, 3V; 1087-1176, 8V; 1245-1380, 11V; 1395-1574, 13V; 1558-1747, 15V; 1766-1908, 17V; 1926-2065, 20V; 2077-2239, 30V; 2318-2442, 50V. Second set (091018_RNAse_S_2):  scans 1128-1313, 3V; 1343-1521, 8V; 1553-1734, 11V; 1768-1907, 13V; 1926-2069, 15V; 2077-2223, 17V; 2239-2381, 20V; 2395-2545, 30V; 2560-2701, 50V. Third set (091018_RNAse_S_3):  scans 660-771, 3V; 802-941, 8V; 950-1102, 11V; 1126-1262, 13V; 1279-1430, 15V; 1441-1593, 17V; 1607-1850, 20V; 1874-2004, 30V; 2040-2173, 50V. The nano ESI mass spectra of FLAG-peptide–antiFLAG antibody complex were processed using the same procedure. The collision cell voltage difference was increased as follows in the  first data set (21032017_FLAG_PEPTIDE MIXTURE 1); 20V: 5-8 min, 40V: 8-11 min, 60V: 11-14 min, 80V: 14-17 min, 100V: 17-20 min, 120V: 20-23 min, 140V: 23-26 min, 150V: 26-29 min, 170V:  29-32 min, 200V: 32-35 min. In the second data set (21032017_FLAG_PEPTIDE MIXTURE 3), the collision cell voltage difference was increased as follows; 20V: 4-6 min, 40V: 6-16 min,  60V: 16-26 min, 70V: 26-36 min, 80V: 36-46 min, 100V: 46-56 min, 120V: 56-66 min, 150V: 66-72 min. The third set (21032017_FLAG_PEPTIDE MIXTURE 4) was acquired with the following collision cell voltage  difference increments; 40V: 13-18 min, 60V: 18-23 min, 70V: 23-28 min, 80V: 28-33 min, 100V: 33-38 min, 120V: 38-43 min, 150V: 43-48 min. For processing the nano ESI datasets of the Troponin I epitope peptide - anti-Troponin I antibody with MassLynx software version 4.1 (Waters MS-Technologies, Manchester, UK) the Savitzky-Golay method  was used for smoothing in 10 cycles with a window of 20. Scans of the following time windows were accumulated to obtain spectra for the single collision voltage differences: min 0-1: 2 V, min 1-2: 4 V,  min 2-3: 6 V, min 3-4: 8 V, min 4-5: 12 V, min 5-6: 16 V, min 6-7: 20 V, min 7-8: 30 V, min 8-9: 40 V, min 9-10: 50 V, min 10-11: 60 V, min 11-12: 70 V, min 12-13: 80 V, min 13-14: 100 V, min 14-15: 120 V.  Time windows were the same for both, the first (10012019_TroponinI_dataset_01) and the second (10012019_TroponinI_dataset_02) raw data set.  The heights of the ion signals (in arbitrary units) were obtained from the mass spectra at all applied collision cell voltage differences, separately for each setting using MassLynx.  These ion intensities were plotted against their respective m/z values and fitted to a Gaussian curve using Origin version 8.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA).  Intensities for each molecular species or complex were determined from the heights of the apexes as well as the average charge states.

### Publication Abstract
Electrospray mass spectrometry is applied to determine apparent binding energies and quasi equilibrium dissociation constants of immune complex dissociation reactions in the gas phase. Myoglobin, a natural protein-ligand complex, has been used to develop the procedure which starts from determining mean charge states and normalized and averaged ion intensities. The apparent dissociation constant KD&amp;nbsp;m0g#= 3.60 &#xd7; 10<sup>-12</sup> for the gas phase heme dissociation process was calculated from the mass spectrometry data and by subsequent extrapolation to room temperature to mimic collision conditions for neutral and resting myoglobin. Similarly, for RNAse S dissociation at room temperature a KD&amp;nbsp;m0g#= 4.03 &#xd7; 10<sup>-12</sup> was determined. The protocol was tested with two immune complexes consisting of epitope peptides and monoclonal antibodies. For the epitope peptide dissociation reaction of the FLAG peptide from the antiFLAG antibody complex an apparent gas phase dissociation constant KD&amp;nbsp;m0g#= 4.04 &#xd7; 10<sup>-12</sup> was calculated. Likewise, an apparent KD&amp;nbsp;m0g#= 4.58 &#xd7; 10<sup>-12</sup> was calculated for the troponin I epitope peptide-antiTroponin I antibody immune complex dissociation. Electrospray mass spectrometry is a rapid method, which requires small sample amounts for either identification of protein-bound ligands or for determination of the apparent gas phase protein-ligand complex binding strengths.
