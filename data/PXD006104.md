### Title
pepper stamen LC-MSMS -  Proteomic analysis reveals strong mitochondrial involvement in cytoplasmic male sterility of pepper (Capsicum annuum L

### Description
We used a high-throughput proteomics method called label-free to compare protein abundance across a pepper CMS line and its isogenic maintainer line.This study explained the mechanisms of cytoplasmic male sterility and contribute to the improvement of pepper hybrid breeding.

### Sample Protocol
Digested peptides were separated with chromatography using an Easy-nLC1000 system (Thermo Scientific) autosampler. Peptide mixture were loaded on a self-made C18 trap column (C18 3mm 0.10×20mm) in solution A (0.1% formic acid), then separated with a self-made Capillary C18 column (1.9mm, 0.15×120mm) with a gradient solution B (100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 600nl/min. Separated peptides were examined in the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a Michrom captive spray nano-electrospray ionization (NSI) source.

### Data Protocol
For protein identification, the protein false discovery rate (FDR) was set to ≤ 1.0% and the minimum number of peptides to identify a protein was set to 1.A fold-change of more than 1.5 and P-value less than 0.05 in at least two replicates was used as the thresholds to define differently expressed proteins.
