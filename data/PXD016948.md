### Title
A highly conserved luminal ER exit motif in the pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2 is indispensable for TNF������ and EGF receptor ligand release

### Description
Membrane-tethered signalling proteins such as TNF������ and many EGF receptor ligands undergo shedding by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 to get released. The pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2 are important for the ER exit and activity of ADAM17. Yet, their structural requirements to promote ER exit remained unexplored. Utilising in silico and in vitro methods, we here map the conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD) and provide insights into its structure and function. We identified a highly conserved motif within the IRHD, which is indispensable for the ER exit of iRhoms and termed it CERES (conserved ER exit sequence). Strikingly, single point mutations in CERES abrogate the ER exit without disrupting other iRhom functions. We confirmed the physiological significance of CERES by inactivating it in mice which abrogates ADAM17-mediated shedding ex vivo and in vivo. This demonstrates a crucial role of CERES in the ADAM17-dependent release of various growth factor and cytokine signals.

### Sample Protocol
Transfected cells (iRhom2 wt-3xHA, iRhom 2 mutant-3xHA and empty GFP (as the control)) were lysed and the protein lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an ������-HA antibody, employing a standard IP protocol. Bound proteins were digested on bead with trypsin a for one hour (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 5 ������g/mL Trypsin), followed by two washes (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM DTT). All the obtained supernatants were combined and left to digest o/n at room temperature. After iodoacetamide modification and acidification of the samples, the peptides were desalted using homemade C18-tips and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS (Q Exactive Plus).

### Data Protocol
The resulting raw data was analysed using MaxQuant (1.6.3.3) and the built-in Andromeda search engine. The spectra were searched against the human UniProt database version 06/2018 (canonical and reviewed only), with the addition of the mouse iRhom2 wt-3xHA and mouse iRhom 2 mutant-3xHA sequences. The search settings for MaxQuant were: Trypsin as the protease, two missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation (Cys) as the fixed modification; oxidation (Met) and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. The FDR was set to 0.01% on protein, peptide and PTM level. All samples (3 biologcal replicates each) were measured in technical duplicates (18 runs in total, 6 per condition). The resulting data was filtered (min 2 peptides per protein, min 1 unique peptide), no ���������reverse��������� hits, no ���������only identified by site��������� hits, no ���������potential contaminats���������. Proteins were required to be quantified in all six measurement of at least one condition to be included in the final list.

### Publication Abstract
Membrane-tethered signalling proteins such as TNF&#x3b1; and many EGF receptor ligands undergo shedding by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 to get released. The pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2 are important for the transport, maturation and activity of ADAM17. Yet, the structural and functional requirements to promote the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Utilising in silico and in vitro methods, we here map the conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD) and provide first insights into its structure and function. By focusing on iRhom2, we identified different structural and functional factors within the IRHD. We found that the structural integrity of the IRHD is a key factor for ADAM17 binding. In addition, we identified a highly conserved motif within an unstructured region of the IRHD, that, when mutated, restricts the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex through the secretory pathway in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo systems and also increases the half-life of iRhom2 and ADAM17. Furthermore, the disruption of this IRHD motif was also reflected by changes in the yet undescribed interaction profile of iRhom2 with proteins involved in intracellular vesicle transport. Overall, we provide the first insights into the forward trafficking of iRhoms which is critical for TNF&#x3b1; and EGF receptor signalling.
