### Title
Abscisic acid enhance cold tolerance in barley

### Description
ABA deficiency reduced low temperature responses via disturbing stability of chloro-plast ultrastructure, modifying the starch and sucrose metabolisms, and affecting an-tioxidant enzyme activities in barley.

### Sample Protocol
Total protein was extracted from barley leaves and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The protein was precipitated with 20% TCA for 2 h at -20 °C. The pellet was washed three times with cold acetone and then the pellet was dissolved in 8 M urea and the protein concentration was determined with BCA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After that, the sample was digested with trypsin. The protein solution was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 11 mM io-doacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in darkness. Then, the protein sample was diluted by adding 100 mM TEAB to urea concentration less than 2M. Trypsin was added at 1:50 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for the first digestion overnight and 1:100 trypsin-to-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h-digestion. The tryptic peptides were loaded onto a reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm length and 75 µm inner diam-eter) coupled to the NanoElute ultra-high performance liquid system. The peptides were subjected to nanospay ionisation followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in a Q ExactiveTM Plus coupled online to a NanoElute UPLC.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.6.6.0). Uniprot Hordeum vulgare (Version 2019-12, 189,799 entries) was added to the database to calculate the false positive rate (FDR) caused by random matching and a common contamination library was added to the database to eliminate the influence of contaminated proteins in the identification results. Trypsin was specified as cleavage enzyme, allowing up to 2 missing cleavages. The minimum length of the peptide segment was set as 7 amino acid residues. The missing match tolerance of the primary parent ion of First match and Main match is set as 40 ppm and 40 ppm respectively, and the missing match tolerance of the secondary fragment ion is 0.04 Da. The alkylation of cysteine was defined as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation of protein were defined as variable modifications. Peptide-to-spectrum (PSM) matches and protein identification with false discovery rate (FDR) smaller than 1%. The proteins were identified with the software MoMo (V5.0.2 http://meme-suite.org/tools/momo) and annotated using GO annotation (v.5.14-53.0 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/); Domain annotation (v.5.14-53.0 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/); Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation with software KAAS (v.2.0 http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas-main) and KEGG Mapper (V2.5 http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/mapper.html); subcellular locali-zation with Wolfpsort (v.0.2 http://www.genscript.com/psort/wolf_psort.html) and CELLO (v.2.5 http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/). Enrichment analysis was performed with a Perl module (v.1.31 https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::NSP::Measures::2D::Fisher) and expression profiles were clustered with the R Package pheatmap (v.2.0.3 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/).
