### Title
LC-MS/MS analysis of Aedes aegypti

### Description
TMT10plex-based shotgun quantitative proteomics of three species of Aedes aegypti.

### Sample Protocol
After protein extraction from Aedes aegypti, proteins were reduced, alkylated and digested. The 10 digests were labeled by TMT10plex and the labeled samples were pooled together for subsequent fractionation using high pH reverse phase chromatograph. The fractions were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis on Orbitrap Fusion.

### Data Protocol
The acquired raw data files were searched using Proteomer Discoverer 2.2 against the Aedes_Reduced 97.fasta database containing a total of 22,036 entries.
