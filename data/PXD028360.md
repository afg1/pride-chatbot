### Title
Investigating pHis in human systems

### Description
We tried to investigate the presence of phosphohistidine in mammalian systems. We investigated this by measuring the presence in multiple cell types, performing kinase assays and dephosphorylating it by acidification

### Sample Protocol
The proteome was digested by trypsin and desalted after which the phosphopeptides were enriched using iron IMAC. Phosphopeptides were measured using mass spectrometry. For the kinase assay, peptides were enzymatically dephosphorylated before they were phosphorylated again by NME.

### Data Protocol
Samples were processed using MaxQuant using the following parameters:digestion by trypsin/P with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. As fixed modification carbamidomethylation of cysteine was chosen, as variable modification pHSTY, oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were chosen. The mass tolerance of precursor ions was chosen as ±5 ppm and the mass tolerance of MS/MS was chosen as ±20 ppm. Results were adjusted to 1% PSM and 1% FDR using a target-decoy approach using reverted protein sequences
