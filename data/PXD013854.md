### Title
Noncoding dsRNA induces Retinoic Acid synthesis to stimulate regeneration

### Description
We uncover a novel mechanism whereby developmental pathways are reactivated in adults to promote regeneration.

### Sample Protocol
Wild-type and Tlr3-/- unwounded and wounded skin where wound regions (center and edge area) were analyzed by Waters nano-ACQUITY UPLC system coupled Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched against UniProt reference proteome using MS Amanda algorithm. Resulting hits were validated at a maximum false discovery rate of 0.01 using Percolator algorithm. Protein abundance ratios were measured by label-free quantification.

### Publication Abstract
How developmental programs reactivate in regeneration is a fundamental question in biology. We addressed this question through the study of Wound Induced Hair follicle Neogenesis (WIHN), an adult organogenesis model where stem cells regenerate de novo hair follicles following deep wounding. The exact mechanism is uncertain. Here we show that self-noncoding dsRNA activates the anti-viral receptor toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) to induce intrinsic retinoic acid (RA) synthesis in a pattern that predicts new hair follicle formation after wounding in mice. Additionally, in humans, rejuvenation lasers induce gene expression signatures for dsRNA and RA, with measurable increases in intrinsic RA synthesis. These results demonstrate a potent stimulus for RA synthesis by non-coding dsRNA, relevant to their broad functions in development and immunity.
