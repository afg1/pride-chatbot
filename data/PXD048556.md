### Title
WT and RNF20 heterozygous-null mice BAT proteome

### Description
Experiments were performed to investigate the BAT proteome of RNF20 WT and heterozygous-null mice.

### Sample Protocol
BAT from WT and RNF20 heterozygous-null male mice (n = 3) raised under room temperature conditions was incubated with RIPA (Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40, 0.25% Homogenize in 500 ul of sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (P3100; GenDEPOT), and MG132 (BML-PI102; Enzo Life Sciences)]). Protein extracts were acetone-precipitated overnight at -20°C, following which a tandem mass tag (TMT) was performed (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Raw spectra were acquired using Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ (Thermo Fisher) and EASY-nLC™ 1200 (Thermo Fisher). Raw MS spectra were processed using MaxQuant software (v1.6.2.2) at default settings with the UniProt Mus musculus database (16,987 reviewed protein sequences). Output files generated by MaxQuant were subjected to Perseus software (Proteome Software Inc.) to quantify TMT peptide and protein identification.

### Publication Abstract
In mammals, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) execute sequential thermogenesis to maintain body temperature during cold stimuli. BAT rapidly generates heat through brown adipocyte activation, and further iWAT gradually stimulates beige fat cell differentiation upon prolonged cold challenges. However, fat depot-specific regulatory mechanisms for thermogenic activation of two fat depots are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20 orchestrates adipose thermogenesis with BAT- and iWAT-specific substrates. Upon cold stimuli, BAT RNF20 is rapidly downregulated, resulting in GABP&#x3b1; protein elevation by controlling protein stability, which stimulates thermogenic gene expression. Accordingly, BAT-specific Rnf20 suppression potentiates BAT thermogenic activity via GABP&#x3b1; upregulation. Moreover, upon prolonged cold stimuli, iWAT RNF20 is gradually upregulated to promote de novo beige adipogenesis. Mechanistically, iWAT RNF20 mediates NCoR1 protein degradation, rather than GABP&#x3b1;, to activate PPAR&#x3b3;. Together, current findings propose fat depot-specific regulatory mechanisms for temporal activation of adipose thermogenesis.
