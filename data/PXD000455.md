### Title
Drosophila melanogaster proteome dataset with high coverage of the genome based on the LC-MS/MS platform

### Description
Here we describe a high coverage dataset of whole fly through a one-dimensional gel electrophoresis LC-MS/MS approach. By combining the datasets of two kinds of SDS-PAGE and two kinds of tagmata, the high coverage analysis resulted in the identification of 5,262 genes, corresponding to 38.23% of the whole encoding genes. Sample info: 4-day adult male Canton-S Drosophila melanogaster was used in this study. To reduce sample complexity, fly heads and bodies (including reproductive system, genitalia and gonad) were sequenced separately. Protein extraction and analysis: Fly heads and bodies were isolated using prechilled size-exclusion sieves and distributed into 1.5-mL tubes separately. Approximately 120 ug of each sample were lysed in 200 ul lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 10% glycine, 1% bromophenol blue, 10 mM DTT, and 0.01% protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 0.5-mm glass beads by vortexing at the highest speed for 5 min. After boiling for 5min, 20 mM iodoacetamide was used to alkylate the proteins. Samples prepared as described above were separated by 1D SDS-PAGE, and the lanes were excised into fractions, followed by in-gel tryptic digestion. All prepared peptides were further analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) coupled with UPLC (nano Acquity Ultra Performance LC, Waters). Protein search:The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against the flybase database (http://flybase.org/, release 5.4, 24,043 entries) using Mascot (version 2.3, Matrix Science). The results were filtered by PepDistiller (v. 1.26) with a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1% at the peptide spectrum match level using the target-decoy strategy.

### Publication Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used model organisms in life sciences. Mapping its proteome is of great significance for understanding the biological characteristics and tissue functions of this species. However, the comprehensive coverage of its proteome remains a challenge. Here, we describe a high-coverage analysis of whole fly through a 1D gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS approach. By combining the datasets of two types of SDS-PAGE and two kinds of tagmata, the high-coverage analysis resulted in the identification of 5262 genes, which correspond to 38.23% of the entire coding genes. Moreover, we found that the fly head and body have different molecular weight distributions of their proteomes when the proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and image analysis of the stained gel. This phenomenon was further confirmed by both label-free and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based quantitative approaches. The consistent results of the two different quantitation methods also demonstrated the stability and accuracy of the LC-MS/MS platform. The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD000454 and PXD000455 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000454; (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000455).
