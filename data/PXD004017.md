### Title
Extracellular citrullination in synovial fluid

### Description
Citrullination of the proteins found in synovial fluid patient samples

### Sample Protocol
The synovial fluid (SF) samples and the fibronectin (FN) samples with or without protein arginine deiminase treatment were precipitated with six volumes of acetone at -20Ã‚Â°C overnight. The precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 20 000 x g and +2Ã‚Â°C for 15 min and dissolved in 6 M urea and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The cysteines were reduced in dithiotreitol to 10 mM and incubation at 37Ã‚Â°C for 1 h and alkylated in 40 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 1 h. After the remaining iodoacetamide was allowed to react with equal amount of dithiotreitol and the solution was diluted to 0.6 M urea with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, the proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) at 37Ã‚Â°C overnight. The peptides were acidified and desalted by binding them to C18 resin (3MM) activated by acetonitrile and equilibrated in a solution containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid and 0.2% acetonitrile, washing three times with equilibration solution, and subsequently eluting them with 65% acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid. After the eluted peptides were dried and dissolved in 1 % formic acid, they were loaded on a nanoflow HPLC system (Easy-nLC1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. Peptides were first loaded on a trapping column and subsequently separated inline on a 15 cm C18 column (75 Ã‚Âµm x 15 cm, Magic 5 Ã‚Âµm 200 Ãƒâ€¦ C18, Michrom BioResources Inc., Sacramento, CA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of water/acetonitrile (98:2 (v/v)) with 0.2% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile/water (95:5 (v/v)) with 0.2% formic acid (solvent B). Peptides from SF samples were separated with a 35 min gradient from 2 to 20 % of solvent B followed by 15 min gradient from 20 to 40 % of solvent B. Peptides from FN samples were separated with 10 min gradient from 5 to 35 % of solvent B. Data dependent acquisition was enabled and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of the top 10 ions from the survey scan over the mass-to-charge (m/z) range 300-2000  with dynamic exclusion time of 10 s was performed in each cycle.

### Data Protocol
Tandem mass spectra were searched against Human UniProtKB sequences (releases 2014_01 and 2014_08) with Proteome Discoverer software, version 1.4. (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, version 2.4) allowing for 5 ppm peptide mass tolerance and a fragment tolerance of 0.02 and 0.015 for SF and FN samples, respectively. Carbamidomethyl (C) as a fixed modification, and citrullination (R), deamidation (N, Q) and oxidation (M) as dynamic modifications were included. To find additional post-translational modifications in SF samples, two separate searches of the tandem mass spectra were performed.  The first search included carbamidomethyl (C) as a fixed modification, and citrullination (R), deamidation (N, Q), oxidation (M), hydroxylation (K, P) and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) as dynamic modifications. The second search included carbamidomethyl (C) as a fixed modification, and oxidation (M), carbamylation (K, peptide N-terminus), acetylation (K, protein N-terminus) and methylation (K, R) as dynamic modifications. Both searches used reviewed (SwissProt) Human UniProtKB sequences (release 2015_08). For all searches, maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Percolator (Spivak et al. 2009, J. Proteome Res. 8:3737-3745) was used to validate the identified peptides. The peptides that were identified when the false discovery rate was set to <0.01 (SF and PAD2-treated FN samples) or <0.05 (PAD4-treated FN samples) were accepted for further analysis. At least two peptide identifications were required for protein identification. The peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) of post-translationally modified peptides were further filtered so that only the PSMs of peptides derived from reviewed proteins and that were determined as “rank 1” and unambiguously identified by Proteome Discoverer software were selected. In addition, the PSMs of peptides having N-terminal carbamylation or modified C-terminal K/R were omitted. The deamidated peptide was defined as citrullinated if it had deamidated R. Otherwise it was defined N/Q-deamidated. If the N/Q-deamidated peptide contained Q, it was defined as N-deamidated. To avoid false positives rising from the multiplicity of peptide-spectrum matching options due to several different theroretical modifications in one peptide, the P/K-hydroxylated peptides were selected only if they did not contain deamidations or phosphorylations. For the same reason, the acetylated, methylated and carbamylated peptides were selected only if they did not contain any other dynamic modifications used in the search. To minimize the number of false positives among the PSMs of citrullinated peptides, the spectra leading to identification of citrullinated peptide (excluding those with C-terminal citrulline) were manually examined with Proteome Discoverer software. Only the citrullinations that were visible in the b or y fragment ion or in the subsequent b or y ion series were accepted. The citrullinations that could not be reliably distinguished from deamidations of N or Q were omitted. Citrullination in SF samples was quantified by counting the number of unique spectra matching to citrullinated peptide and comparing that to the total number of spectra leading to protein identification. Similarly, citrullination of a particular peptide or protein was quantified by comparing the number of spectra matching to citrullinated peptide(s) to the total number of spectra matching to the corresponding peptide or protein.

### Publication Abstract
We report the extent, specific sites and structural requirements of joint inflammation related citrullination in extracellular proteins. A total of 40 synovial fluid samples derived from chronically inflamed human joints were analysed by heparin-agarose fractionation and LC-MS/MS. Citrullination of 55 arginines in extracellular proteins was detected. Importantly, 20% of the sites have a characterized function related to the hallmarks of destructive joint inflammation. E.g. four arginine residues, shown here to be citrullinated, are also affected by mutations in inherited diseases causing haemolysis or blood clotting dysfunction. Citrullination of integrin ligands was selected for further studies since fibronectin R234 in isoDGR was among the most frequently citrullinated arginines in synovial fluid. Assays with synovial fibroblasts and integrin &#x3b1;V&#x3b2;3 indicated decreased affinity to the enzymatically citrullinated integrin binding sites. To conclude, our data indicate that in inflamed joints extensive citrullination affects the functional arginine residues in extracellular proteins.
