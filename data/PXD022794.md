### Title
Dimethyl labeling-based quantitative PTM proteomic analysis of drought-regulated phosphoproteomes in soybean drought-tolerant cultivar

### Description
The isotopic dimethyl labeling-based quantitative post-translational modification proteomics was applied to study the phosphoproteomic changes associated with the drought responses of two contrasting soybean cultivars. A total of 9,457 non-redundant, unambiguous, label-independent and repeatable phosphopeptides were subsequently identified from six experimental replicates, corresponding to 9,234 of deduced unique phosphoproteins. These soybean proteins contain a total of  20,880 phosphosites, 84.9% of which were found to be novel phosphosites of the soybean phosphoproteome. The overly post-translationally modified proteins is 2.05% of the phosphoproteins identified. Most of these extensively phosphorylated proteins are photoreceptors, mRNA-, histone- and phospholipid-binding as well as  serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase/phosphatases. The subgroup population distribution of phosphoproteins over the number of the phosphosite of phosphoprotein follows the exponential decay law, Y=4.13e^(-0.098X)-0.04. From 218 significantly regulated unique phosphopeptide groups, 188 significantly regulated phosphoproteins were found, and they are  enriched in biological functions of water transport and deprivation, methionine metabolic process, photosynthesis/light reaction, and response to cadmium ion, osmotic stress and ABA  under drought treatment. A total of 15 and 20 drought-tolerant cultivar significantly regulated phosphoproteins are transcription factors and protein kinases/phosphatases, respectively. More than 50% of these phosphoproteins are considered to be novel regulatory components, presumably mediating the development of the soybean drought tolerance under water deprivation process. The association of five randomly selected phosphoproteins with the drought response was corroborated with the qRT-PCR method.

### Sample Protocol
Urea-based protein extraction, In-Solution Trypsin Digestion and Dimethyl Labeling, TiO2/Fe3+IMAC Phosphopeptide Enrichment, Fractionation of Phosphopeptides on both WAX and SCX Columns and LC-MS/MS. The phosphopeptides were resuspended with solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and analyzed on an Easy nLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled to an Orbitrap FusionÃ¢â€žÂ¢ LumosÃ¢â€žÂ¢ TribridÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For each LC-MS/MS run, phosphopeptide sample was loaded onto an analytic column (Thermo Scientific EasySpray C18 column, 3 um, 15cm x 75 um) with a flow of 0.6 or 0.3 ÃŽÂ¼L/min. The phosphopeptides were separated on a 95-min gradient of 2 to 50% solvent B ( ACN mix with 0.1% formic acid): 0 to 2 % solvent B, 0 -10 min, 0.6 ul/min ; 2 - 5 % solvent B, 10 -13 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min; 5 - 30 % solvent B, 13 - 85 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min; 30 - 50% solvent B, 85 - 87 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min; 50 - 5 % solvent B, 87 - 89 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min; 5 - 5% solvent B, 89 - 94 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min ; 5 - 2 % solvent B, 94 - 95 min, 0.6 Ã¯ï¿½Â­L/min. MS1 mass resolution was set at 120 K with m/z of 375 -1500 for a maximum injection time of 50  ms while MS2 resolution at 30 K under HCD collision mode with a normalized collision energy at 30% for a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Filter type has an intensity threshold of 2.0e-4,  while the isolation mode was set as quadrupole and isolation window (m/z) as 1.6.

### Data Protocol
The raw data files from LC-MS/MS analysis were firstly converted into the mzXML and MGF format using MS convert GUI (version: 3.0.18353 64-bit, Supplemental Fig. S2, Chambers et al., 2012). The MGF files were searched against the soybean NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using a Mascot Daemon (Version 2.6.0 64-bit, Matrix Science, Supplemental Fig. S2, Chambers et al. 2012) with a target-decoy strategy as previously described (Elias et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2013).  The parameters were set as followings: protease was trypsin, the maximum missed cleavage two, the peptide tolerance   Ã‚Â±10 ppm, the MS/MS tolerance Ã‚Â± 0.02 Da, the variable modifications were oxidation on Methionine, light dimethyl labeling was on lysine residue and N terminus of a peptide, heavy dimethyl labeling on lysine residue and N terminus of a peptide, phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues of a peptide, and finally the fixed modification carbamidomethyl on cysteine. The output of the Mascot was consequently subjected to SQUA-D software (Stable isotope-based Quantitation-Dimethyl labeling, Version 1.0, Liu et al., 2018a) for further XIC-based quantification.  The MascotPercolator (Version 3, Supplemental Fig. S2) was used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of PSMs, which was subsequently converted into q-value. All PSMs of a q-value Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.01 would be considered for a further selection for quantification. The selection criteria for quantifiable phosphopeptides to be processed by SQUA-D software was the followings: the PSM number of heavy dimethyl-labelled PTM peptides was >=1, the PSM number of light dimethyl labelled PTM peptides PSMs >=1, the number of different experimental replicates >=4, the number of PSMs identified from either  forward or reciprocal experiment divided by the total number of PSMs >= 0.2,  the Mascot delta score >=10 and  the MS1 tolerance < 0.05 Da.

### Publication Abstract
Isotopically dimethyl labeling was applied in a quantitative post-translational modification (PTM) proteomic study of phosphoproteomic changes in the drought responses of two contrasting soybean cultivars. A total of 9457 phosphopeptides were identified subsequently, corresponding to 4571 phosphoprotein groups and 3889 leading phosphoproteins, which contained nine kinase families consisting of 279 kinases. These phosphoproteins contained a total of 8087 phosphosites, 6106 of which were newly identified and constituted 54% of the current soybean phosphosite repository. These phosphosites were converted into the highly conserved kinase docking sites by bioinformatics analysis, which predicted six kinase families that matched with those newly found nine kinase families. The overly post-translationally modified proteins (OPP) occupies 2.1% of these leading phosphoproteins. Most of these OPPs are photoreceptors, mRNA-, histone-, and phospholipid-binding proteins, as well as protein kinase/phosphatases. The subgroup population distribution of phosphoproteins over the number of phosphosites of phosphoproteins follows the exponential decay law, Y = 4.13e<sup>-0.098X</sup> - 0.04. Out of 218 significantly regulated unique phosphopeptide groups, 188 phosphoproteins were regulated by the drought-tolerant cultivar under the water loss condition. These significantly regulated phosphoproteins (SRP) are mainly enriched in the biological functions of water transport and deprivation, methionine metabolic processes, photosynthesis/light reaction, and response to cadmium ion, osmotic stress, and ABA response. Seventeen and 15 SRPs are protein kinases/phosphatases and transcription factors, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis again revealed that three members of the calcium dependent protein kinase family (CAMK family), GmSRK2I, GmCIPK25, and GmAKIN&#x3b2;1 kinases, constitute a phosphor-relay-mediated signal transduction network, regulating ion channel activities and many nuclear events in this drought-tolerant cultivar, which presumably contributes to the development of the soybean drought tolerance under water deprivation process.
