### Title
Human “free-N-terminome” analysis

### Description
The high throughput characterization of protein N-termini is becoming an emerging challenge in the proteomics and proteogenomics fields. The present study describes the N-terminal oriented analysis of human mitochondria enriched samples by the trimethoxyphenyl phosphonium (TMPP) labeling approach (N-TOP and dN-TOP approaches (Gallien et al, 2009, Bertaccini et al. 2013)). The dN-TOP strategy based on a double light/heavy TMPP labeling has been optimized in order to  improve and automate the workflow for efficient, fast and reliable high throughput N-terminome analysis.

### Sample Protocol
Mitochondria were enriched and purified from cultured U-937 human monocytic cells. Proteins were extracted and derivatized on their N-terminal free amino acid by light and heavy TMPP. Then separated by SDS-PAGE and gels bands were systematically cut, reduced, alkylated and enzymatically digested overnight. Resulting peptides were extracted and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS.

### Data Protocol
A first search round was done using a classical proteomics identification strategy for protein identification. During this search round interesting PTMs such as N-terminal acetylation are also identified. For N-terminal peptide identification, a second search round was performed. The fragmentation spectra of all putative labeled N-terminal peptides were manually inspected, taking into account the contribution of the N-terminal TMPP group (chromatographic retention time shift, particular fragmentation pathways, and charge states of the peptides). A peptide sequence was considered as unique if it belonged to only one protein in the canonical human protein database used for the searches. Only TMPP-labelled peptides that met all these criteria were validated.

### Publication Abstract
The high throughput characterization of protein N-termini is becoming an emerging challenge in the proteomics and proteogenomics fields. The present study describes the free N-terminome analysis of human mitochondria-enriched samples using trimethoxyphenyl phosphonium (TMPP) labelling approaches. Owing to the extent of protein import and cleavage for mitochondrial proteins, determining the new N-termini generated after translocation/processing events for mitochondrial proteins is crucial to understand the transformation of precursors to mature proteins. The doublet N-terminal oriented proteomics (dN-TOP) strategy based on a double light/heavy TMPP labelling has been optimized in order to improve and automate the workflow for efficient, fast and reliable high throughput N-terminome analysis. A total of 2714 proteins were identified and 897 N-terminal peptides were characterized (424 N-&#x3b1;-acetylated and 473 TMPP-labelled peptides). These results allowed the precise identification of the N-terminus of 693 unique proteins corresponding to 26% of all identified proteins. Overall, 120 already annotated processing cleavage sites were confirmed while 302 new cleavage sites were characterized. The accumulation of experimental evidence of mature N-termini should allow increasing the knowledge of processing mechanisms and consequently also enhance cleavage sites prediction algorithms. Complete datasets have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifiers PXD001521, PXD001522 and PXD001523 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001521, http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD0001522 and http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001523, respectively).
