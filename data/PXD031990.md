### Title
Salmonella infected human Hela LC-MSMS

### Description
To explore the influence of IpaJ on host cell signaling pathways, a quantitative phosphorylation proteomic analysis was carried out in this project

### Sample Protocol
The samples come from two groups of Hela cells infected with the Salmonella strains, namely C79-13-infected group and Î”ipaJ-infected group.

### Data Protocol
The resulting MS/MS data were processed using Maxquant search engine (v.1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy database.
