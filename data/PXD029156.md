### Title
CLUH controls astrin-1 expression to couple mitochondrial metabolism to cell cycle progression

### Description
Proliferating cells undergo metabolic changes in synchrony with cell cycle progression and cell division. Mitochondria provide fuel, metabolites, and ATP during different phases of the cell cycle, however it is not completely understood how mitochondrial function and the cell cycle are coordinated. CLUH is a post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and several metabolic pathways. Here, we show a role of CLUH in regulating the expression of astrin, which is involved in metaphase to anaphase progression, centrosome integrity, and mTORC1 inhibition. We find that CLUH binds both the SPAG5 mRNA and its product astrin, and controls the synthesis and the stability of the full-length astrin-1 isoform. We show that CLUH interacts with astrin-1 specifically during interphase. Astrin-depleted cells show mislocalized CLUH at focal adhesions, mTORC1 hyperactivation and enhanced anabolism. On the other hand, cells lacking CLUH show decreased astrin levels and increased mTORC1 signaling, but cannot sustain anaplerotic and anabolic pathways. In absence of CLUH, cells fail to grow during G1, and progress faster through the cell cycle, indicating dysregulated matching of growth, metabolism and cell cycling. Our data reveal a role of CLUH in coupling growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression.

### Sample Protocol
After knock-out induction, HeLa WT ind, SPAG5 and KNSTRN ind KO cells were collected by scraping, pelleted and resuspended in appropriate amount of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH8; 1% IGEPAL CA-630; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate freshly supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)]. Lysates were passed 3x through syringe (30G x 1/2”, B. Braun Sterican) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 x g at 4°C, protein amounts were determined using standard Bradford assay (Biorad) and 30 µg of protein lysate were precipitated with acetone. Briefly, 4x volume of ice-cold acetone were added to lysates, incubated for 15 min at -80°C followed by 90 min incubation at -20°C and centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 x g. Pellets were washed in ice-cold acetone, air-dried and resuspended in 50 µl of 8 M urea in 50 mM triethylammoniumbicarbonate including protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Afterwards proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1h at 25°C and alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Next, proteins were digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:75 at 25°C for 4h. Samples were diluted with 50 mM triethylammoniumbicarbonate to reach a final urea concentration of 2 M. Then proteins were digested with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:75 and incubation at 25°C for 16 h. Next day, samples were acidified with formic acid to stop enzymatic digestion, purified with and loaded on StageTips as described before (Rappsilber et al, 2007). Samples were stored in dried StageTips at 4°C until mass spectrometry was performed. Peptide digests were analyzed on a Q Exactive plus Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer that was coupled to an EASY nLC (Thermo Scientific). Samples were loaded onto an in-house packed analytical column (50 cm x 75 µm I.D., filled with 2.7 µm Poroshell EC120 C18, Agilent). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 250 nL/min and the following gradient: 3-5% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80 % acetonitrile) within 1.0 min, 5-30% solvent B within 91.0 min, 30-50% solvent B within 17.0 min, 50-95% solvent B within 1.0 min, followed by washing with 95 % solvent B for 10 min. DDA runs for spectrum library generation were acquired from distinct pools of the sample groups and Hek293 cell digests fractionated high pH HPLC. MS1 survey scan were acquired at a resolution of 70,000. The top 10 most abundant peptides were isolated within a 2.0 Th window and subjected to HCD fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 27%. The AGC target was set to 5e5 charges, allowing a maximum injection time of 105 ms. Product ions were detected in the orbitrap at a resolution of 35,000. Precursors were dynamically excluded for 20.0 s. Sample runs were acquired in data-independent mode using 10 variable windows covering the mass range from m/z 450 to m/z 1200. MS1 scans were acquired at 140,000 resolution, maximum IT restricted to 120 ms and an AGC target set to 5e6 charges. The settings for MS2 scans were 17,500 resolution, maximum IT restricted to 60 ms and AGC target set to 5e6 charges. The default charge state for the MS2 was set to 4. Stepped normalized collision energy was set to 23.5, 26 and 28.5.

Stepped normalized collision energy was set to 23.5, 26 and 28.5. All spectra were acquired in profile mode. A hybrid spectrum library was generated in Spectronaut 13 using DDA library runs, DIA sample runs and a canonical human sequence file (SwissProt, 20416 entries) downloaded from Uniprot. Spectronaut default settings were used for the analysis of the DIA runs. Protein identifications were filtered for q-values below 0.01 and normalized intensities were exported for subsequent statistical analysis in Perseus  1.6.1.1. Intensities were transformed to log2 values and the dataset was filtered for at least 4 out of 4 values in at least one condition. Remaining missing values were imputed with random values from the left end of the intensity distribution (with 0.3 sd, downshift 2 sd). Two sample Student´s T-tests were calculated using permutation based FDR estimation.
