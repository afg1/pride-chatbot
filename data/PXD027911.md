### Title
PSCK9 knockdown in EndoC-bH1 cells at 72 h (DIA proteomics experiment)

### Description
EndoC-bH1 cells were incubated with control siRNA or PCSK9 siRNA for 72 hours. The experiment was powered based PCSK9 knockdown in a pilot experiment. Sample size: 12x12.

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were lysed using PreOmics iST lysis buffer (PreOmics, Planegg, Germany) at 95*C for 10min. Lysate was normalized using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equivalent amounts of each condition was subjected to enzymatic cleavage for 3 hours by adding equal amounts of endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin in a 1:50 (wt/wt) enzyme:protein ratio. De-salting and purification were performed according to the PreOmics iST protocol on a styrene divinylbenzene reversed-phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) sorbent. Peptides were loaded onto a 25cm IonOpticks Aurora Series emitter Column (25cm x 75u ID, 1.6um C18; IonOpticks, Australia) performed by a Dionex Ultimate 3000 coupled online to an Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source, integrated with a column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach, Germany) maintained at 50°C. Peptides were separated using a non-linear gradient. Orbitrap Exploris 480 was operated in BoxCar Data Independent Acquistion positive mode. BoxCar windows spanned 400-1200m/z space and a total of 48 MS2 DIA variable windows were used.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were processed using SpectronautTM V14.10 with parameters in PE273.setup.
