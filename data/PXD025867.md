### Title
Identification of SUMO targets required to maintain human stem cells in the pluripotent state. - Total protein level changes in response to ML792 treatment

### Description
To determine the role of SUMO modification in the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells we used ML792, a potent and selective inhibitor of SUMO Activating Enzyme. Treatment of human induced pluripotent stem cells with ML792 initiated changes associated with loss of pluripotency such as reduced expression of key pluripotency markers. To identify putative effector proteins and establish sites of SUMO modification, cells were engineered to stably express either SUMO1 or SUMO2 with TGG to KGG mutations that facilitate GlyGly-K peptide immunoprecipitation and identification. A total of 976 SUMO sites were identified in 427 proteins. STRING enrichment created 3 networks of proteins with functions in regulation of gene expression, ribosome biogenesis and RNA splicing, although the latter two categories represented only 5% of the total GGK peptide intensity. The remainder have roles in transcription and chromatin structure regulation. Many of the most heavily SUMOylated proteins form a network of zinc-finger transcription factors centred on TRIM28 and associated with silencing of retroviral elements. At the level of whole proteins there was only limited evidence for SUMO paralogue-specific modification, although at the site level there appears to be a preference for SUMO2 modification over SUMO1 in acidic domains. We show that SUMO is involved in the maintenance of the pluripotent state in hiPSCs and identify many chromatin-associated proteins as bona fide SUMO substrates in human induced pluripotent stem cells.

### Sample Protocol
ChiPS4 cells were either DMSO treated (0 hours condition), or treated with 400nM ML792 for 24 hours or 48 hours. Four replicates of each condition were prepared. Crude cell extracts were made to a protein concentration of between 1 and 2 mg.ml-1 by addition of 1.2x LDS sample buffer containing 60mM DTT (NuPAGETM ThermoFisher Scientific) to PBS washed cells followed by sonication. For each replicate 25ug protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (NuPage 10% polyacrylamide, Bis-Tris with MOPS buffer— Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie blue. Each lane was excised into four roughly equally sized slices and peptides were extracted by tryptic digestion (Nat Protoc. 2006;1(6):2856-60. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes. Shevchenko A, Tomas H, Havlis J, Olsen JV, Mann M.) including alkylation with chloroacetamide. Peptides were resuspended in 35 uL 0.1% TFA 0.5% acetic acid and 10uL of each analysed by LC-MS/MS. This was performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific), using an EASY-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific) running a 75 μm x 500 mm EASY-Spray column at 45ºC. A 240 minute elution gradient with a top 10 data-dependent method was applied. Full scan spectra (m/z 300–1800) were acquired with resolution R = 70,000 at m/z 200 (after accumulation to a target value of 1,000,000 ions with maximum injection time of 20 ms). The 10 most intense ions were fragmented by HCD and measured with a resolution of R = 17,500 at m/z 200 (target value of 500,000 ions and maximum injection time of 60 ms) and intensity threshold of 2.1x104. Peptide match was set to ‘preferred’, a 40 second dynamic exclusion list was applied and ions were ignored if they had unassigned charge state 1, 8 or >8.

### Data Protocol
Data analysis used MaxQuant version 1.6.1.0 (Cox, J. and Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification. Nat Biotechnol, 2008, 26, pp 1367-72.). Default setting were used except the match between runs option was enabled, which matched identified peaks among slices from the same position in the gel as well as one slice higher or lower. The uniport human proteome database (downloaded 24/02/2015 - 73920 entries) digested with Trypsin/P was used as search space. LFQ intensities were required for each slice but LFQ normalization was switched off.
