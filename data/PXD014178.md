### Title
Ancient human brain LC-MS proteomic analysys

### Description
LC-MS proteomic analysis of a 2,400-year old human brain.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extracts from cortex and white matter were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by LC-MS. 5 µl 4 x LDS buffer (5 µl) were added to protein extracts (15 µl) and the samples were incubated at 70°C for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To preclude contamination of the samples with proteins from the laboratory environment, the gel chamber was cleaned prior to use, and pre-cast gels (NuPAGE, Thermo Fischer) were used that were not exposed to any other samples.  Following Coomassie blue staining, the gel lanes were sliced in eight equal-size pieces, which were subjected to reduction and alkylation of cysteine-disulfides and tryptic digestion. The samples were reconstituted in 6 µl 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA. Aliquots of 5 µl were loaded on a nanoflow-LC (RSLC nano, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a C18 trap column (PepMap Acclaim 75 µm *20 mm, Thermo Scientific), and a C18 separation column (PepMap Acclaim 75 µm * 500 mm, Thermo Scientific), coupled to a Q-Exactive electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a FlexiSpray ion source. Prior to analyzing the samples, several blank LC injections (loading buffer) were performed to ensure the absence of contaminating proteins from previous analyses. The loading buffer was 2% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA; Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid; and Buffer B was 84% ACN, 0.1% formic acid. The following gradient was used: t=0 min, B=3%; 140 min, B=30%; 160 min, B=45%; 165 min, B=80%. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode. Data-dependent acquisition was used, acquiring one full MS scan (R 140k, AGC target 3e6, max IT 250 ms, scan range 400 to 1600 m/z, ) and up to 10 consecutive HCD MS/MS scans (R=70k, AGC target=1e6, max IT=250 ms, isolation window 1.2 m/z, NCE 32.0, charge exclusion: unassigned, >6). Samples were analysed in duplicate.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification was performed using the software PEAKS Studio 8.5, which is based on automatic de novo peptide sequencing. The human subset of the SwissProt database was searched using the following settings: Parent Mass Error Tolerance: 15 ppm; Fragment Mass Error Tolerance: 0.05 Da; Enzyme: Trypsin; Max Missed Cleavages: 3; Non-specific Cleavage: one; Fixed Modification: Carbamidomethylation. Validation of peptide identifications was performed using the target-decoy approach. Proteins are reported that had at least one unique peptide hit with a score corresponding to <1% FDR.

### Publication Abstract
Human proteins have not been reported to survive in free nature, at ambient temperature, for long periods. Particularly, the human brain rapidly dissolves after death due to auto-proteolysis and putrefaction. The here presented discovery of 2600-year-old brain proteins from a radiocarbon dated human brain provides new evidence for extraordinary long-term stability of non-amyloid protein aggregates. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the preservation of neurocytoarchitecture in the ancient brain, which appeared shrunken and compact compared to a modern brain. Resolution of intermediate filaments (IFs) from protein aggregates took 2-12 months. Immunoassays on micro-dissected brain tissue homogenates revealed the preservation of the known protein topography for grey and white matter for type III (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and IV (neurofilaments, Nfs) IFs. Mass spectrometry data could be matched to a number of peptide sequences, notably for GFAP and Nfs. Preserved immunogenicity of the prehistoric human brain proteins was demonstrated by antibody generation (GFAP, Nfs, myelin basic protein). Unlike brain proteins, DNA was of poor quality preventing reliable sequencing. These long-term data from a unique ancient human brain demonstrate that aggregate formation permits for the preservation of brain proteins for millennia.
