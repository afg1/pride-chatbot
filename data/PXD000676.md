### Title
Metallosphaera cuprina cultivation on sulfur or yeast extract

### Description
By using heterotrophic proteome as reference, 169 proteins were found to change their abundance during autotrophic growth. The up-regulated proteins indicated that M. cuprina fixed CO2 through the previously identified 3-HB-CoA/4-HB-CoA cycle and obtained energy by oxidation of elemental sulfur as energy source under autotrophic growth. Enzymes/proteins involved in semi- and non-phosphorylating Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway were down-regulated. We also found that some transporter proteins changed their abundances, suggest that they were likely playing pivotal roles for growth under the respective conditions.

### Sample Protocol
Metallosphaera cuprina is able to grow under either heterotrophic or autotrophic growth. In order to obtain a global overview of physiological adaptations at proteome level, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions from cells grown autotrophically on CO2 plus sulfur or heterotrophically on yeast extract were compared.

### Data Protocol
All database searches were performed using SEQUEST algorithm, embedded in BioworksTM (Rev. 3.3, Thermo Electron & 1998–2006), with a M. cuprina Ar-4 genomic database obtained from EBI proteomes containing 2029 protein entries. The selected enzyme specificities were different for predigest and the SIMPLE samples. For predigest samples only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavages were accepted, while for SIMPLE samples no enzyme specificity was considered. All other search parameters were: cysteine alkylation for cytoplasmic proteins/no fixed modifications for membrane proteins, and oxidation of methionine was permitted as variable modification. The mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to 10 ppm; the mass tolerance for fragment ions was set to 1 amu. For protein identification, a threshold for both protein and peptide probability was set to 0.001, and at least two different peptides per protein were required. Estimation of the false discovery rate (FDR) was done with a reversed database generated in BioworksTM as described. The FDR for protein identification was below 1% for all predigest, SIMPLE and cytoplasmic proteins measurements.
