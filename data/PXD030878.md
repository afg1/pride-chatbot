### Title
In-depth quantitative proteomic analysis of rat cardiac tissue for exploring potential mediators of early cardiac reaioablation effect

### Description
Recently, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is adopted to noninvasively treat catheter ablation-refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT episodes were dramatically reduced after SABR within few weeks, but underlying mechanisms of these clinical effects as well as potential mediator of early antiarrhythmic effects were unknown

### Sample Protocol
We divided experimental rats into three groups as follows: non-irradiated control 0 Gy, conventional irradiated control 2 Gy, and radioablative group 25 Gy. Harvesting cardiac tissue was performed 3 days and 7 days after irradiation, respectively. Tissue samples were processed using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) procedure.

### Data Protocol
After the MS analysis, all raw files were processed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software based on the SEQUEST-HT search engine against the RAT Uniprot FASTA database. Parameters were as follows: enzyme, full-trypsin; precursor ion tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS ion tolerance, 20 ppm; fixed modifications, TMT tags (N-term and Lys, +229.163 Da) and carbamidomethylation (Cys, +57.021 Da); and variable modifications, oxidation (Met, +15.995 Da). The false discovery rate (FDR) for all peptide-spectrum match (PSM) were adjusted to a 1%, and protein assignments were performed by the Percolator software package. Only the PSMs that contained all six reporter ions. Protein quantitation values were exported for further analysis in Microsoft Excel. Each reporter ion channel was summed across all quantified proteins and normalized assuming equal protein loading of all ten samples
