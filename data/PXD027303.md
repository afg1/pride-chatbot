### Title
Protein-SIP of cellulose-fed reactors

### Description
In this study we examined an anaerobic digester reactor fed with cellulose in order to identify cellulose degrading microorganisms using a culture independent approach. A metagenome was linked to the newly synthesized proteins involved by cellulose, by investigation of labelled proteins (Protein-SIP). The study aims at identifying microorganisms involved in the degradation of plant-based biomass.

### Sample Protocol
Protein extraction was performed using liquid-liquid extraction using TEAB (0.05 M TEAB buffer stock, 1.0 mg/L NaDOC, pH â‰¤ 8) as resuspension buffer. Extracted proteins were digested using in-gel digestion protocol, following desalting and analysis of tryptic peptides by automated liquid chromatograph-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

### Data Protocol
To identify the peptides/proteins a search using OMSSA in an OpenMS pipeline, with the precursor mass tolerance set to 5 ppm, the fragment mass tolerance to 0.01 Da, and false discovery rate (FDR) to 1%. RIA and the labelling ratio (LR) were determined using OpenMS and the MetaProSIP tool with a minimum correlation of 0.7 and a mass window of 10 ppm.
