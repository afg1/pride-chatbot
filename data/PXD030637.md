### Title
Activity-dependent changes in the nuclear proteome and transcriptome of forebrain excitatory neurons during Pilocarpine-induced seizures

### Description
LC-MS/MS-based proteomics method was used to study activity-dependent changes in the nuclear proteome and transcriptome of forebrain excitatory neurons during Pilocarpine-induced seizures.

### Sample Protocol
Nucleus of mouse brain tissues of CaMKIIÎ±-Cre:SUN1-sfGFP mice were pull down. Three independent biological replicates were performed in the project. Nucleus proteome were purified, digested and labelled with TMT-6plex tags. The sample was used for proteomic experiment using Q-Exactive MS.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were analysed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 (PD2.2) software. The MS/MS spectra were searched using Sequest algorithm for peptide-spectrum match. The identified proteins were exported from PD2.2 to Excel file format for further analysis.
