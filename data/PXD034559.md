### Title
P-body proteome

### Description
LC-MS/MS was conducted to characterize the proteome of P-bodies in HeLa cells.

### Sample Protocol
P-bodies in HeLa cells were purified by fluorescence-activated particle sorting (FAPS). The P-body and the input (Total) samples were examined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The experiments were performed in two replicates.

### Data Protocol
The search engine was Proteome Discoverer (Version 2.1) based on the UniProt Homo sapiens database.
