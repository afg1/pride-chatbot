### Title
Genetic deletion of MMP12 ameliorates cardiometabolic disease by improving insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation, and atherosclerotic features in mice

### Description
Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) is a macrophage-secreted protein that is massively upregulated as a pro-inflammatory factor in metabolic and vascular tissues of mice and humans suffering from cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). However, the molecular mechanisms explaining the contributions of MMP12 to CMDs are still unclear.

### Sample Protocol
We investigated the impact of MMP12 deficiency on CMDs in a mouse model that mimics human disease by simultaneously developing adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. To this end, we generated and characterized low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)/Mmp12-double knockout (DKO) mice fed a high-fat sucrose- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 16-20 weeks.We investigated the impact of MMP12 deficiency on CMDs in a mouse model that mimics human disease by simultaneously developing adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. To this end, we generated and characterized low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)/Mmp12-double knockout (DKO) mice fed a high-fat sucrose- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 16-20 weeks and shotgun proteomics was performed in aorta and visceral adipose tissue.

### Data Protocol
The MS raw data files, obtained from Orbitrap FusionTM Tribrid™ Mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano electrospray ion source, were converted to mzML format for proteomics using the MSconvert tool of the ProteoWizard software (version 3.0.). Converted mzML files were analyzed afterwards with OpenMS ver. 2.8, which was operating on the open-source software platform KNIME® version 4.6. The peptide identification was done using an approach combining the search engines as previously described in project PXD030365.
