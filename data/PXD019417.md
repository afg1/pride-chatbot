### Title
MceC affinity purification and interactome analysis

### Description
Anti-FLAG affinty purification of mitochondria isolated from tetracycline inducible HEK293 cells expressing MceC-3XFLAG or control (EV) cells. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were solubilised and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation performed.

### Sample Protocol
Mitochondria were isolated in 3 independent biological replicates from each MceC-3XFLAG expressing or control (EV) cells were analysed. Following immunoprecipitation, elution fractions were acetone precipitated, solubilised in 6M urea, 2M thiourea, reduced with 10mM DTT for 1 hour followed by alkylation with 40mM CAA for one hour. Samples were digestedwith trypisin and peptides cleaned up using C18 stage tips.

### Data Protocol
Data was processed using MaxQuant (version 10.6.10.43) and further analysis was undertaken in Perseus (version 1.6.7.0).
