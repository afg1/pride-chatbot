### Title
PRM analysis of serum samples obtained from PCa and BPH patients

### Description
The aim of this project was the development of a predicitive model combining clinical variables and a panel of proteins measured by targeted-MS able to distinguish PCa from BPH. In particular, a total of 32 formerly N-glycosylated peptides were quantified by PRM.

### Sample Protocol
Serum samples were digested by tryptic in-solution digestion. Glycopeptides were enriched by titanium dioxide protocol, then de-glycosylated by PNGase F. Before being purified from salts and other contaminants, samples were added of isotopically labelled internal standards.  After reversed phase StageTip purification, samples were analyzed by targeted LC-MS/MS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Raw files were imported into Skyline v 19.1 and peaks were automatically integrated and manually inspected. Parameters: charge state was set to 2, 3 and 4; the product ions were 1-, 2-, 3- charged (ion types y, b, p) with a up to 6 product ions. The ion match tolerance was set to 0.05 m/z.
