### Title
A Proteome-Wide Atlas of Lysine-Reactive Chemistry

### Description
Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun to characterize the reactivity and ligandability of lysines on a global scale. Yet, only a limited diversity of aminophilic electrophiles have been evaluated for interactions with the lysine proteome. Here, we report an in-depth profiling of >30 uncharted aminophilic chemotypes that greatly expands the content of ligandable lysines in human proteins. Aminophilic electrophiles showed disparate proteomic reactivities that range from selective interactions with a handful of lysines to, for a set of dicarboxaldehyde fragments, remarkably broad engagement of the covalent small molecule-lysine interactions captured by the entire library. We used these latter â€œscoutâ€� electrophiles to efficiently map ligandable lysines in primary human immune cells under stimulatory conditions. Finally, we show that aminophilic compounds perturb diverse biochemical functions through site-selective modification of lysines in proteins, including protein-RNA interactions implicated in innate immune responses. These findings support the broad potential of covalent chemistry for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were treated and processed as described in the methods section.

### Data Protocol
RAW files were convereted to MS1/MS2 files as necessary using Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2) and searched using ProLuCID. All downstream processing are described in methods section.

### Publication Abstract
Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun to characterize the reactivity and ligandability of lysines on a global scale. Yet, only a limited diversity of aminophilic electrophiles have been evaluated for interactions with the lysine proteome. Here, we report an in-depth profiling of &gt;30 uncharted aminophilic chemotypes that greatly expands the content of ligandable lysines in human proteins. Aminophilic electrophiles showed disparate proteomic reactivities that range from selective interactions with a handful of lysines to, for a set of dicarboxaldehyde fragments, remarkably broad engagement of the covalent small-molecule-lysine interactions captured by the entire library. We used these latter 'scout' electrophiles to efficiently map ligandable lysines in primary human immune cells under stimulatory conditions. Finally, we show that aminophilic compounds perturb diverse biochemical functions through site-selective modification of lysines in proteins, including protein-RNA interactions implicated in innate immune responses. These findings support the broad potential of covalent chemistry for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome.
