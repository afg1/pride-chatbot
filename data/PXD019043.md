### Title
Rab1b-AMPylation by Legionella DrrA is allosterically activated by Rab1

### Description
Legionella pneumophila infect eukaryotic cells by forming a replicative organelle – the Legionella containing vacuole. During this process, the bacterial protein DrrA/SidM is secreted and manipulates the activity and posttranslational modification (PTM) states of the vesicular trafficking regulator Rab1. As a result, Rab1 is modified with an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) – a process referred to as AMPylation. Here, we used a chemical approach for stabilizing low affinity Rab:DrrA complexes in a site-specific manner to gain insights into the molecular basis of the interaction between the Rab protein and the AMPylation domain of DrrA. The X-ray crystal structure of the Rab:DrrA complex revealed a previously unrecognized non-conventional Rab binding site (NC-RBS). Biochemical characterizations demonstrated allosteric stimulation of DrrA’s AMPylation activity via Rab-binding to the NC-RBS. We propose that allosteric control of DrrA not only prevents random and potentially cytotoxic AMPylation in the host, thereby ensuring an efficient infection process by Legionella, but also represents an unprecedented AMPylation activation mechanism.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 200 µL buffer X (7 M urea, 2 M Thiourea) for denaturation. To dissolve the proteins completely sonicate the samples were sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath. 0.2 µL of 1 M DTT were added to each sample, mixed and incubated for 45 min at rt and 450 rpm to reduce proteins. For alkylation 2 µL of 550 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) were supplemented, mixed and incubated at rt, 450 rpm for 30 min in the dark. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.8 µL of 1 M DTT and incubation at rt for 30 min at 450 rpm. 600 µL of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) were added so that the pH should bewas around 8. Finally, 1.0 µL trypsin (0.5 (µg)/(µL)) werewas added and the digest occurredincubated at 37 °C overnight at 450 rpm. The reaction was stopped by the addition of formic acid, (pH should be 3 or below, if not more formic acid was added). For desalting Stage-Tipping with double C18-membran (Octadecyl C18 47 mm Extraction disks, Empore Products, USA) waswere used. The membrane was washed with 70 µL MeOH, 70 µL buffer E (80 % (v/v) ACN, 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid) and three times with 70 µL 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid before the digested protein sample was loaded. The membrane was washed again three times with 70 µL 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid before eluting with two times 30 µL buffer E into a LoBind tube. Samples were lyophilized using a SpeedVac and were stored at -80 °C until measurement. Before applying the samples on the instrumentmass spectrometer, they were dissolved in 30 µL 1 % (v/v) formic acid and filtered using Ultrafree-MC-GV centrifugal filters. The filter was washed with 300 µL 1 % (v/v) formic acid by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 2 min before the dissolved sample was filtered (13 000 rpm; 2 min) and collected into a new LoBind tube. MS analysis of digested protein samples was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion instrument coupled to an Ultimate3000 Nano-HPLC via an electrospray easy source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). 7 µL of the sample were loaded on a 2 cm PepMap RSLC C18 trap column (particles 2 μm, 100A, inner diameter 75 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 0.1 % TFA and separated on a 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 column (particles 2 μm, 100A, inner diameter 75 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) constantly heated at 50 °C. The gradient was run from 5-32% acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid (7 min 5%, 105 min to 22%, 10 min to 32%, 10 min to 90%, 10 min wash at 90%, 10 min equilibration at 5 %) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Survey scans (m/z 300-1500) were acquired in the orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms with an AGC target of 4e5. Most intense ions with charge states 4-8 and an intensity threshold of 5e3 were selected for fragmentation by high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 30%. Fragment spectra were again recorded in the orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and an AGC target of 5e4. The option “inject ions for all available parallelizable time” was enabled. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with an exclusion duration of 120 s. The overall cycle time was 5 s.

### Data Protocol
Raw mass data files were converted into mzML files using MSConvert from ProteoWizard (Chambers et al., 2012). Crosslink searches were then performed with the software Kojak, version 1.5.5 (http://www.kojak-ms.org) (Hoopmann et al., 2015) against a database consisting of Rab1b_Q67A_R69K-DrrA1-339, common contaminant proteins downloaded from the Andromeda configuration in the MaxQuant software package (Cox and Mann, 2008) and all of teh reverse sequences. The MS1 and MS2 resolution were set to 120,000 and 30,000, respectively. Variable modifications: Oxidation on methionine (+15.9949) and AMPylation on tyrosine (+329.0525). Static modifications: Carbamidomethylation (+57.02146) on cysteine. Three modifications were allowed per peptide. The fragment bin offset was set to 0 and the size to 0.03. A maximum of three missed cleavages were allowed. The minimum peptide mass was set to 300 Da. The precursor mass tolerance was fixed to 10. The unnatural amino acid was encoded as lysine in our database, thus we searched for crosslinks (+96.0575) between lysines and cysteines, serines, threonines, aspartates, glutamates, and the protein N-termini. Additionally, we searched for the monolink (+175.9837). Annotated spectra were visualized with the Kojak Spectrum viewer (Hoopmann et al., 2016).
