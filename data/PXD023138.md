### Title
SARS-CoV-2 S protein ACE2 interaction reveals novel allosteric targets

### Description
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to receptor ACE2 allosterically enhances furin proteolysisat distal S1/S2 cleavage sites

### Sample Protocol
Deuterium labelling for free proteins and protein complexes: Recombinant purified S protein, ACE2 receptor and recptor binding domain (RBD) solubilized in phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) were incubated at 37°C in PBS buffer reconstituted in D2O (99.90%) resulting in a final D2O concentration of 90%. In the case of complexeses, S:ACE2 and RBD:ACE2 complexes were pre-incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a molar ratio of 1:1 to achieve >90% binding prior to each hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction. Deuterium labeling was performed for 1 min, 10 min and 100 min for isolated construct of RBD, free ACE2, and RBDisolated:ACE2 complex. For isolated S protein and S:ACE2 complex 1 min and 10 min labelling timescales were used.  Quench: Pre-chilled quench solution 1.5 M GnHCl and 0.25 M Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine-hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) was added to deuterium exchange reaction mixture to lower the pHread to ~2.5 and lower temperature to ~ 4 °C. Next, the quenched reaction was incubated at 4 °C on ice for 1 min followed by pepsin digestion. LC-MS: After pepsin digestion, the proteolyzed peptides were eluted using acetonitrile gradient of 8 to 40 % in 0.1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 40 μl min-1 into reverse phase column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column, 1.0 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters)pumped by nanoACQUITY Binary Solvent Manager. Electrospray ionization mode was used to ionize peptides sprayed onto SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer  acquired in HDMSE mode of detection and measurement. A flow rate of 5 μl/min was used to inject 200 fmol μl-1 of [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B ([Glu1]-Fib) into mass spectrometer for lockspray correction.

### Data Protocol
Undeuterated protein samples were used to identify sequences from mass spectra data (in HDMSE mode) using Protein Lynx Global Server (PLGS) v3.0. Peptide identification search was performed against a separate sequence database of each protein sequence along with its respective affinity purification tag sequences. In the PLGS search parameters, i) no specific protease and ii) variable N-linked glycosylation modification options were selected for sequence identification. The identified peptides were further filtered using a minimum intensity cutoff of 2500 for product and precursor ions, minimum products per amino acids of 0.2 and a precursor ion mass tolerance of <10 ppm using DynamX v.3.0 and tested for pepsin cleavage specificity. Peptides independently identified under the specified condition and present in at least in two out of three undeuterated samples were retained for HDXMS analysis.Deuterium exchange plots, relative deuterium exchange and difference plots were obtained from DynamX 3.0. N-terminus and prolines were excluded for estimation of exchangeable amides per peptide
