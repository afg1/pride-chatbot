### Title
Protein profile of mouse ovarian follicles grown in vitro

### Description
This project presents a protein catalog of the in vitro growing mouse ovarian follicle and it provides insights about proteomics throughout in vitro follicle development.

### Sample Protocol
Individually in-vitro culturing ovarian follicles of mice were selected at 3 developmental stage. Total proteins extacts were fractionated using in-gel IEF and proteins fractions were analyzed by 1DLC-MS/MS (Reversed Phase) or 2DLC-MS/MS (SCX followed by Reversed Phase).

### Data Protocol
1D- and 2DLC-MS/MS data were processed by X!Tandem pipeline (version 3.3.2) for protein identification taking into consideration trypsin as the cleavage enzyme, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation as a variable modification, a peptide mass tolerance of 0.5 Da and a charge of + 2 or + 3.  Quantitative analysis were performed on 1DLC-MS/MS data only using Progenesis LC-MS software (version 4.1.4832.42146) and local Mascot server (version 2.2.07) with the same parameters as above for protein identification.
