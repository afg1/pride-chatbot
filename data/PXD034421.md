### Title
microbial metaproteome from global ocean

### Description
This project contains metaproteome for marine planktonic communities including eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea and viruses

### Sample Protocol
About 100 - 400 liters of seawater were sequentially filtered through 0.8um and 0.22 um pore-size polycarbonate membranes (142 mm diameter) at 22 stations from the Pacific, Atlantic and Southern Ocean . The filtrates were further concentrated using tangential flow filtration at a molecular weight cutoff of 5000 Da to a final volume of 50 ml to collect viral and dissolved proteins.

### Data Protocol
rotein pellet of each sample was digested using filter-aided in-solution trypsin digestion method (1:100, w/w). The peptides were sequenced on a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) after desalting.
