### Title
MEF cell proteome quantification

### Description
Global quantification of the dynamics of proteome and lysine succinylation proteome upon the loss of SDH in MEF cells.

### Sample Protocol
WT and SDH-KO MEF cells were labeled with light and heavy isotope-encoded Lys and Arg in SILAC workflow. The cells were lysed and equal amount of proteins were mixed. Proteins were digested by trypsin. One fraction of peptides were fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography and analyzed by nanoHPLC-Orbitrap MS analysis and the other fraction of peptides were subject to immunoaffinity purification by pan-succinyl lysine antibody and LCMS analysis.

### Data Protocol
Identification and quantification of proteins and lysine succinylated peptides were achieved by Maxquant software by searching tandem MS data against the Uniprot mouse database.
