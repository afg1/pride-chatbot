### Title
Glycosylation analysis of BCAL2737A

### Description
Glycosylation analysis of BCAL2737A constructs using HCD, CID and ETD to confirm glycosylation sites

### Sample Protocol
In gel samples were destained, reduced and akylated then digest overnight with trypsin. Peptides were collected and cleaned up using C18 stage tips. Cleaned up samples were eluted, dried down and stored at -20C

### Data Protocol
Samples were processed using Maxquant 1.5.3.30 The bukholderia glycans were included as varible modifications and the data searched against sequences of the BCAL2737A constructs

### Publication Abstract
None

### Keywords
