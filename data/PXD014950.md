### Title
medulloblastoma label free proteome analysis from an Indian subpopulation

### Description
The label free tissue proteomic analysis of medulloblastoma proteome was perfomed for the identification of protein markers for the developinment of IHC markers for the diagnostic purpose. The pathway al;tyerations and protein signatures of G3 tumor is the major focus.

### Sample Protocol
Tg eurea lysis buffer and Benzonse for the endogenous prtienase inhibitors are containg buffer used for the extraction. Then trypsin based enzynaitic digestion follwed byziptiiping

### Data Protocol
The proteome Discoverer 2.2 has implemented for the raw data processing with high stringent FDR of !%. The human uniprot data base was down loaded from the uniprot site. The contaminant data base was incorporated. The mascot and Sequest were used as search engines.
