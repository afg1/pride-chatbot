### Title
Chronic p53-independent p21 expression deregulates replication licensing, leading to genomic instability

### Description
P53 independent P21 expression deregulates replication licensing , leading to genomic instability

### Sample Protocol
Cell pellets were suspended in TEAB, SDS and subjected to tip sonication. Protein lysates were quantified for their protein content using the Bradford essay. 100ug of protein per sample was subjected to reduction, alkylation, trypsin proteolysis and iTRAQ labelling.

### Data Protocol
Raw data files were submittes to Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for target decoy search using Sequest
