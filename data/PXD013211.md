### Sample Protocol
Cells were grown to near confluency in a 10 cm tissue culture dish before being harvested by centrifugation at 800×g for three minutes at room temperature. The resulting pellet was then washed twice with PBS and then twice in ice cold permeabilization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM DTT), before incubation in digitonin solution (0.1% digitonin in permeabilization buffer) at 4°C with rotation for 30 minutes. Subsequently the total cell membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 800×g, 4°C . The membrane pellet was then resuspended in urea lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 9 M urea, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, β.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM b-glycerophosphate) and lysed with a sonic probe, before clearing the lysate through centrifugation at 20,000×g for 15 minutes and transferring the supernatant into a LoBind microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf). Proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol and incubation at 55°C for 30 mins before alkylating with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Solutions were diluted to 2 M urea with aqueous 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate before digesting with the addition of 1 mg of trypsin/Lys-C protease mixture (Promega) and incubation at 37°C. Digestion was stopped after 16 h with addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to 0.1% (v:v). Peptides were desalted using Strata 50 mg C18 cartridges (Phenomenex). Cartridges were prepared by passing through 3 mL acetonitrile, 2 mL aqueous 80% (v:v) acetonitrile 0.1% (v:v) TFA and 2 mL aqueous 0.1% (v:v) TFA. Peptides were loaded and cartridges washed with 2×2.5 mL aqueous 0.1% (v:v) TFA. Peptides were eluted with aqueous 80% (v:v) acetonitrile 0.1% (v:v) TFA before drying in a vacuum concentrator and reconstituting in aqueous 0.1% (v:v) TFA. A common sample pool was created by taking equal aliquots of all samples. Samples were loaded onto an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo) equipped with a PepMap 100 Å C18, 5 µm trap column (300 µm x 5 mm Thermo) and a PepMap, 2 µm, 100 Å, C18 EasyNano nanocapillary column (75 µm x 500 mm, Thermo). The trap wash solvent was aqueous 0.05% (v:v) trifluoroacetic acid and the trapping flow rate was 15 µL/min. The trap was washed for 3 min before switching flow to the capillary column. Separation used gradient elution of two solvents: solvent A, aqueous 1% (v:v) formic acid; solvent B, aqueous 80% (v:v) acetonitrile containing 1% (v:v) formic acid. The flow rate for the capillary column was 300 nL/min and the column temperature was 40°C. The linear multi-step gradient profi le was: 3-10% B over 8 mins, 10-35% B over 115 mins, 35-65% B over 30 mins, 65-99% B over 7 mins and then proceeded to wash with 99% solvent B for 4 min. The column was returned to initial conditions and re-equilibrated for 15 min before subsequent injections. The nanoLC system was interfaced with an Orbitrap Fusion hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo) with an EasyNano ionisation source (Thermo). Positive ESI-MS and MS2 spectra were acquired using Xcalibur software (version 4.0, Thermo). Instrument source settings were: ion spray voltage, 1,900 V; sweep gas, 0 Arb; ion transfer tube temperature; 275°C. MS 1 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with: 120,000 resolution, scan range: m/z 375-1,500; AGC target, 4e5; max fill time, 100 ms. Data-dependent acquisition was performed in top speed mode using a fixed 1 s cycle, selecting the most intense precursors with charge states 2-5. Easy-IC was used for internal calibration. Dynamic exclusion was performed for 50 s post precursor selection and a minimum threshold for fragmentation was set at 5e3. MS2 spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap with: scan rate, turbo; quadrupole isolation, 1.6 m/z; activation type, HCD; activation energy: 32%; AGC target, 5e3; first mass, 110 m/z; max fill time, 100 ms. Acquisitions were arranged by Xcalibur to inject ions for all available parallelizable time.

### Data Protocol
Peak lists in .raw format were imported into Progenesis QI (Version 2.2., Waters) and LC-MS runs aligned to the common sample pool. Precursor ion intensities were normalised against total intensity for each acquisition. A combined peak list was exported in .mgf format for database searching against the human subset of the UniProt database. Mascot Daemon (version 2.6.1, Matrix Science) was used to submit the search to a locally-running copy of the Mascot program (Matrix Science Ltd., version 2.6.1). Search criteria specified: Enzyme, trypsin; Max missed cleavages, 2; Fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl (C); Variable modifications, oxidation (M); Peptide tolerance, 3 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.5 Da; Instrument, ESI-TRAP. Peptide identifications were passed through the percolator algorithm to achieve a 1% false discovery rate and individual match filtered to require a minimum expect score of 0.05. The Mascot .XML result file was imported into Progenesis QI and peptide identifications associated with precursor peak areas. Normalisation was performed between acquisitions against total precursor intensities for a subset of known ER proteins. Relative protein abundance was calculated using precursor ion areas from non-conflicting unique peptides. Statistical testing was performed in Progenesis QI and ANOVA-derived p-values were converted to multiple test-corrected q-values using the Hochberg and Benjamini approach.

### Publication Abstract
The decoration of proteins by carbohydrates is essential for eukaryotic life yet heterogeneous due to a lack of biosynthetic templates. This complex carbohydrate mixture-the glycan profile-is generated in the compartmentalized Golgi, in which level and localization of glycosylation enzymes are key determinants. Here, we develop and validate a computational model for glycan biosynthesis to probe how the biosynthetic machinery creates different glycan profiles. We combined stochastic modeling with Bayesian fitting that enables rigorous comparison to experimental data despite starting with uncertain initial parameters. This is an important development in the field of glycan modeling, which revealed biological insights about the glycosylation machinery in altered cellular states. We experimentally validated changes in N-linked glycan-modifying enzymes in cells with perturbed intra-Golgi-enzyme sorting and the predicted glycan-branching activity during osteogenesis. Our model can provide detailed information on altered biosynthetic paths, with potential for advancing treatments for glycosylation-related diseases and glyco-engineering of cells.
