### Title
Mass spectrometry-based proteomics discovery of prognostic biomarkers in adrenal cortical carcinoma

### Description
Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare disease with a variable prognosis. Current prognostic markers have limitations in identifying patients with a poor prognosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic protein biomarkers of ACC using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. We performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 45 adrenal tumors.

### Sample Protocol
Sample preparation for proteomic analysis of FFPE samples was performed as previously described. Briefly, FFPE sections were incubated twice in xylene for 5 min, followed by 100% (v/v) ethanol twice for 3 min. The sections were than hydrated twice in 85% (v/v) ethanol for 1.5 min and distilled water for 5 min. Extraction buffer (4% SDS, 1mM TCEP, and 0.3M Tris pH 8.0) were added to deparaffized tissue sam-ples. After sonication, the samples were incubated at 95 吏퇒 for 2 h. The extracted pro-teins were precipitated by adding chilled acetone at a buffer to acetone volume ratio of 1:5, followed by incubation at 占쎈땵20 吏퇒 for 16 h. The protein (50 �뿙g per sample) was di-gested following the filter-aided sample preparation procedure as previously described.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectra were processed using MaxQuant version 1.6.1.0. The MS/MS spectra were searched against the Human Uniprot protein sequence database (De-cember 2014, 88,657 entries) using the Andromeda search engine. Primary searches were performed using a 6-ppm precursor ion tolerance to analyze the total protein lev-els. The MS/MS ion tolerance was set at 20 ppm. Cysteine carbamide-methylation was set as a fixed modification. N-acetylation of proteins and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set to complete tryptic digestion. Peptides with a minimum length of six amino acids and up to two missed cleavages were considered. The required false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% at the peptide, protein, and modification levels.

### Publication Abstract
Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare disease with a variable prognosis. Current prognostic markers have limitations in identifying patients with a poor prognosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic protein biomarkers of ACC using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. We performed the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 45 adrenal tumors. Then, we selected 117 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among tumors with different stages using the machine learning algorithm. Next, we conducted a survival analysis to assess whether the levels of DEPs were related to survival. Among 117 DEPs, HNRNPA1, C8A, CHMP6, LTBP4, SPR, NCEH1, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were significantly correlated with the survival of ACC. In age- and stage-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models, only HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 expression remained significant. These five proteins were also validated in TCGA data as the prognostic biomarkers. In this study, we found that HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were protein biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of ACC.
