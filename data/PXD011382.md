### Title
The GTPase Nog1 co-ordinates assembly, maturation and quality control of distant ribosomal functional centers

### Description
Yeast ribosome assembly analysis, using APMS on various 60S tagged subunits (SSF1, RIX1, ARX1, KRE35, ARX1_bud20D, KRE35_DRG1, KRE35_drg-dn, YEP, G223, NOG1)

### Sample Protocol
Various ribomsomal 60S subunits were used to pull-down the large ribosome subunit precursor (pre-60S)at various assembly states; data was acquired in DDA for library generation and DIA/SWATH for label-free AP-MS quantification

### Data Protocol
The DDA data was searched with Comet and Mascot, validated with TPP/peptideProphet and iProphet; the spectral library was generated using spectraST; the DIA/SWATH data was extracted using openSWATH and aligned using TRIC
