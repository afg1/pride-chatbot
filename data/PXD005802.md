### Title
Signaling and crosstalk of the angiotensin AT2-receptor and the receptor MAS

### Description
The AT2-receptor (AT2R) and the receptor MAS are GPCRs within the renin-angiotensin-system mediating protective actions. Their unconventional signaling mechanisms are still not well characterized, but those known display a high degree of similarity. The proposed project is part of a large-scale collaboration with the group of Robson Santos, a leader in Ang1-7/MAS research, aiming at a better characterization of AT2R-MAS signaling and crosstalk. Building up on our finding that the AT2R and MAS heterodimerise and on the mapping of the entire Ang-(1âˆ’7)/MAS signaling network by the Santos group, the proposed studies will look at AT2R-MAS signaling in two ways: mapping the AT2R signaling network by quantitative phosphoproteomics and compare it with the MAS network.
