### Title
1.Integrated network pharmacology and proteomics to reveal the cognitive improvement effect of Wuzang Wenyang Huayu decoction on vascular dementia

### Description
To investigate the Wuzang Wenyang Huayu Decoction Regulates Differentially Expressed Proteins in the Rat, Hippocampus after Cerebral Hypoperfusion.

### Sample Protocol
Established a two-vessel occlusion rat model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Rats were intragastrically administered ( Wenyang 1.25g/kg for VD-WY-L, Wenyang 5g/kg for VD-WY-Hï¼ŒPiracetam 0.15g/kg for VD-P, and PBS for sham as controls ) the medications for 2 consecutive weeks. Learning and memory abilities were measured with Morris water maze. Neuronal plasticity was observed by HE staining. Differentially expressed proteomics of rat hippocampus were analyzed by proteomics analysis using MS/MS technology

### Data Protocol
NanoLC 1000 LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1000 coupled to Thermo Fisher Q Exactive
