### Title
Revealing the dynamic allosteric changes required for formation of the cysteine synthase complex by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry

### Description
CysE and CysK, the last two enzymes of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway, engage in a bienzyme complex, cysteine synthase (CS), with yet incompletely characterized three-dimensional structure and regulatory function. Being absent in mammals, the two enzymes and their complex are attractive targets for antibacterial drugs. We have used hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to unveil how complex formation affects the conformational dynamics of CysK and CysE. Our results support a model where CysE is present in solution as a dimer of trimers, and each trimer can bind one CysK homodimer. When CysK binds to one CysE monomer, intra-trimer allosteric communication ensures conformational and dynamic symmetry within the trimer. Furthermore, a longer-range allosteric signal propagates through CysE to induce stabilization of the interface between the two CysE trimers, preparing the second trimer for binding the second CysK with a non-random orientation. These results provide new molecular insights into the allosteric formation of the CS complex and could help guide antibacterial drug design.

### Sample Protocol
Prior to HDX labeling, CysK and CysE proteins were diluted to 5 μM in 5 μl of equilibration solution (PBS, pH 7.45). For CS complex formation, proteins were diluted to 5 μM CysK and 7.5 μM CysE in 5 μl total volume of equilibration buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The relative concentration of the proteins in the complex was chosen according to the known binding stoichiometry of 2:3. The HDX reactions were initiated by diluting the samples 1:9 with 99% deuterated PBS buffer at 25 °C. According to these experimental conditions, more than 90% of CysE will be assembled with CysK. Proteins were labeled for the following time periods: 0.03, 1.67, 16.67, 60 and 720 min. For the shorter deuterium labeling time (0.03 min), two people were required for sample preparation. In accordance to community-based guidelines, two time points (0.03, 1.67 min) were prepared in triplicate to allow a reasonable estimate of experimental error, whereas the other time periods were performed in single replicate. Non-deuterated samples were prepared in triplicate for CysK and 1 replicate for CysE and CS complex. Maximum deuterated controls were prepared for the CS complex in triplicate. 5 μM CysK and 7.5 μM CysE in 5μl total volume of equilibration buffer were diluted 1:9 with the deuterated buffer 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 6 M guanidinium chloride and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After incubation with deuterium, each sample was quenched by 1:1 dilution into ice-cold quenching buffer (300 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.3). Quenched samples were immediately frozen at –80 °C and stored until measurements by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS analysis). Frozen quenched samples were quickly thawed in a table top centrifuge and injected into a refrigerated (0 °C) UPLC system (nanoAcquity UPLC and HDX manager, Waters, Milford, MA). The samples were subjected to online pepsin digestion at 20 °C through a home-packed column (2 cm in length, 2 mm i.d.) containing pepsin immobilized on agarose beads (Thermo Scientific, 125 μM). The resulting peptides were trapped on a trap column (VanGuard BEH C18 precolumn, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm x 5 mm, Waters) and desalted for 3 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min with solvent A (0.23% formic acid in MQ water, pH 2.5). Subsequently, the peptides were separated over an analytical column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 1.0 x 100 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, with a 9 min linear gradient rising from 8 to 40% solvent B (0.23% formic acid in acetonitrile). Following the chromatographic separation, the peptides were analysed using a hybrid ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Synapt G2-Si, Waters). The MS was operated in positive ionization mode and the peptides were further separated by ion mobility to enhance peak capacity. Glu-fibrinopeptide B was used for lock mass correction of all spectra. For peptide identification, non-deuterated samples were injected and subjected to 2 different chromatographic separation conditions: a short gradient, identical to deuterated samples, and a long gradient (35 min linear gradient rising from 5 to 30% solvent B, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min). The chromatographic separation was performed using the same set-up as the deuterated samples. MS/MS analyses were performed using a combination of data independent (DIA/MSE) and data dependent (DDA) acquisition mode.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS data were processed with ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) version 3.0 (Waters, Milford, MA) for peptide identification. Peptides identified by DDA MS/MS data had to have PLGS Ladder Score above 1.0 and a mass error below 15 ppm for the precursor ion. Importantly, manual inspection and quality control of the fragment spectrum for each selected peptide was also done. To increase sequence coverage, peptides similarly identified in DDA MS/MS data acquired using an extended chromatographic gradient (35 min), were added to the final peptide list if their retention time and precursor mass could be additionally identified and verified in data acquired using the same gradient used for the actual HDX-MS experiment. DynamX version 3.0 (Waters, Milford, MA) was used to filter peptides identified by data independent acquisition (DIA), based on the following parameters: minimum 2 product ions, minimum 0.2 product ions per amino acid, maximum 10 ppm mass error on precursor ion. Further, the peptides were filtered by identification in a minimum of three out of four consecutive MSE runs. Analysis of deuterium uptake of all identified peptides was manually verified.
