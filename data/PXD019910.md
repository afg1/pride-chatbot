### Title
CSF proteomic study of Alzheimer's Disease

### Description
TMT Proteomic study of CSF from patients with Alzheimer's disease, non-cognitively impaired controls, and subjects with mild or subjective cognitive impairment

### Sample Protocol
CSF samples (50mcl) were subjected to reduction (TCEP), carbamidomethylation (iodoacetamide), and tryptic digestion, followed by TMT11plex labeling. The samples were pre-fractionated by RP-HPLC at basic pH (12 concatenated fractions), and analyzed in the data-dempendent mode on by LC-MS using a Orbitrap hydbrid mass spectrometer (Fusion Tribrid). MS2 spectra were acquired in MS2-mode.

### Data Protocol
Data processing was performed within the software ProteomeDiscoverer v.2.2. (Thermo Scientific), using Mascot (MatrixScience) for protein identification (precursor Dm tolerance 15 ppm, fragment tolerance 0.05 Da, max missed cleavage sites 2), searching the human subset of the UniProtKB SwissProt database  (www.uniprot.org). Percolator (MatrixScience) was used for scoring peptide specific matches, and a strict 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was set as threshold for identification. For reporter ion quantification the following settings were used: Integration tolerance 20 ppm; Integration Method Most Confident Centroid; normalize on the reference protein average.
