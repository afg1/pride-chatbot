### Title
PfAP2-O Influences Virulence Gene Transcription and Sexual Development in Plasmodium falciparum

### Description
The project examined the function of the putative transcription factor PfAP2-O from Plasmodium falciparum. This factor besides an essential function in sexual stages also influences variant, virulence associated genes. In a pull down analysis, HA-tagged PfAP2-O was immunoprecipitated and proteins assoaciated were analysed and three differentially appearing protein bands were analysed.

### Sample Protocol
Trypsin digest of bands excised from SDS-PAGE, pre-purification via RP18 columns. Peptides were separated via a nanoLC and afterwards determined using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos ETD.

### Data Protocol
Raw data were loaded on Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and the readout saved as an Excel file.
