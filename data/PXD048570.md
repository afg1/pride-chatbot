### Title
The Acetylation proteomics of HL-60 cells in the presence or absence of amiodarone

### Description
To verify the acetylation effect of amiodarone on HL-60 cells, we treated HL-60 cells with 10 渭M amiodarone for 24 h and collected cells for acetylation protein detection

### Sample Protocol
Cells are lysed for protein extraction;Detection of protein concentration and enzymatic hydrolysis;Total peptide desalination;Immunoaffinity purification of modified peptide segments;LCMSMS dectection

### Data Protocol
The original data for mass spectrometry analysis is RAW files, which are identified and quantitatively analyzed using the built-in software Mascot's Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific). Uniprot_ Human_ 156914_ 20170308. fasta, a total of 156914 sequences. Check the database using Mascot software version 2.3. When checking the database, submit the RAW file to the Mascot server through Proteome Discoverer, select the already established database, and then perform a database search. Proteome Discoverer 2.1 FDR 鈮� 0.01 (High) based on peptide identification results Confirm to filter.
