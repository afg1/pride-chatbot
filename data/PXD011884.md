### Title
Synechococcus IBT LC-MS/MS -  Proteomic Response to Rising Temperature in the Marine Cyanobacterium Synechococcus Grown in Different Nitrogen Sources

### Description
we investigated molecular response of an oceanic Synechococcus strain WH 8102 grown on two nitrogen sources (nitrate and urea) under present (25°C) and predicted future (28°C) temperature conditions using an IBT-based quantitative proteomic approach.

### Sample Protocol
Acquired peptides were treated with a demineralization process using Strata X column and then dried by vacuum centrifugation, and then re-dissolved in 0.2 M TEAB buffer. The IBT labeling of peptides was performed using an IBT Reagent 10-plex Kit developed and provided by the Shenzhen Genomics Institute.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS data were transformed through the Proteome Discoverer 1.2 (Thermo) into MGF format. Protein identification was performed using Mascot 2.3.02 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA), which was then compared against the proteomic database of Synechococcus sp. WH8102 (2511 proteins). (22) The defaults of Mascot search were set as follows: the peptide and fragment mass tolerance were 20 ppm and ±0.05 Da. Variable modifications included Oxidation (M) and IBT 10plex (Y) while the fixed modification included Carbamidomethyl (C), IBT 10plex (N-term) and IBT 10plex (K). For IBT quantification, the Mascot results were re-estimated using the IQuant algorithm (23) with the picked protein false discovery rate. (24) To control the false positive of the proteins, at least one unique peptide with 99% confidence interval in both the peptide-spectrum matching level and protein level were counted as identified. Differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were defined when the protein abundances were greater than 1.5-fold and the Q-values were below 0.05. For repeat treatments, only proteins that were defined as differently expressed in at least one comparable group were considered to be different proteins. Different proteins were clustered using hierarchical cluster software PermutMatrix (v1.9.3). (25)

### Publication Abstract
<i>Synechococcus</i> is one of the most important contributors to global primary productivity, and ocean warming is predicted to increase abundance and distribution of <i>Synechococcus</i> in the ocean. Here, we investigated molecular response of an oceanic <i>Synechococcus</i> strain WH8102 grown in two nitrogen sources (nitrate and urea) under present (25&#xb0;C) and predicted future (28&#xb0;C) temperature conditions using an isobaric tag (IBT)-based quantitative proteomic approach. Rising temperature decreased growth rate, contents of chlorophyll a, protein and sugar in the nitrate-grown cells, but only decreased protein content and significantly increased zeaxanthin content of the urea-grown cells. Expressions of CsoS2 protein involved in carboxysome formation and ribosomal subunits in both nitrate- and urea-grown cells were significantly decreased in rising temperature, whereas carbohydrate selective porin and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) were remarkably up-regulated, and carbohydrate degradation associated proteins, i.e., glycogen phosphorylase kinase, fructokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were down-regulated in the urea-grown cells. Rising temperature also increased expressions of three redox-sensitive enzymes (peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin, and CP12) in both nitrate- and urea-grown cells. Our results indicated that rising temperature did not enhance cell growth of <i>Synechococcus</i>; on the contrary, it impaired cell functions, and this might influence cell abundance and distribution of <i>Synechococcus</i> in a future ocean.
