### Title
proteotypes of 76 breast cancer cell lines by PCT-SWATH

### Description
Here we obtained the proteotypes of 76 breast cancer cell lines using pressure cycling technology (PCT) and SWATH mass spectrometry.

### Sample Protocol
Each cell line was lyzed and digested in triplecates (except two lines) using pressure cycling technology (PCT) (Pubmed ID: 25730263). Each digest was analyzed in a tripleTOF 5600 under SWATH mode. The variable SWATH windows optimized for breast cancer cell lines was used for SWATH-MS.

### Data Protocol
The SWATH data were first analyzed using OpenSWATH with a SWATH assay library built from cell lines, containing 86,209 proteotypic peptide precursors in 8,056 proteotypic SwissProt proteins. Then the results were refined using DIA-expert (manuscript in preparation)
