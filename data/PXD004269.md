### Title
The response of the root proteome to the synthetic strigolactone GR24 in Arabidopsis

### Description
Strigolactones are plant metabolites that act as phytohormones and rhizosphere signals. Whereas most research on unraveling the action mechanisms of strigolactones is focused on plant shoots, we investigated proteome adaptation during strigolactone signaling in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Through large-scale, time-resolved, and quantitative proteomics, the impact of the strigolactone analog rac-GR24 was elucidated on the root proteome of the wild type and the signaling mutant more axillary growth 2 (max2). Our study revealed a clear MAX2-dependent rac-GR24 response: an increase in abundance of enzymes involved in flavonol biosynthesis, which was reduced in the max2-1 mutant. Mass spectrometry-driven metabolite profiling and thin-layer chromatography experiments demonstrated that these changes in protein expression lead to the accumulation of specific flavonols. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the flavonol-related protein expression profile was caused by rac-GR24--induced changes in transcript levels of the corresponding genes. This induction of flavonol production was shown to be activated by the two pure enantiomers that together make up rac-GR24. Finally, our data provide much needed clues concerning the multiple roles played by MAX2 in the roots and a comprehensive view of the rac-GR24--induced response in the root proteome.

### Sample Protocol
RP-HPLC Fractionation of Peptide Mixtures--Peptides were separated on a 2.1 mm internal diameter (I.D.)×150 mm column (Zorbax®, 300 SB-C18 Narrowbore, Agilent Technologies) preceded by a C8 pre-column. An 140-min gradient was used with HPLC solvent A, consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5) in HPLC grade 98/2 (v/v) water/acetonitrile and solvent B composed of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5) in HPLC grade 30/70 (v/v) water/acetonitrile to fractionate in one-minute-wide fractions and finally pooled into 20 fractions for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Thirty minutes before the samples were injected for reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC, a methionine oxidation step was carried out by adding 3% (v/v) H2O2. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to a final concentration of 2 mM to reduce S S bridges just before the injection. Samples were vacuum-dried and resuspended in 20 µL of solvent A’ (2% [v/v] acetonitrile with 0.1% [v/v] trifluoroacetic acid). The obtained peptide mixtures were introduced into the Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano LC-MS/MS system (Dionex) connected in-line to a hybrid LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sample mixture was loaded on an in-house--made trapping column (100 µm I.D.×20 mm, 5-µm C18 Reprosil-HD beads [Dr. Maisch]). After back-flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on an in-house--made analytical reverse-phase column (75 m I.D.×150 mm, 5-µm C18 Reprosil-HD beads [Dr. Maisch]). Of the peptide mixture, 6 µL was loaded with solvent A’ and separated with a linear gradient from 2% (v/v) solvent A” (0.1% [v/v] formic acid) to 50% (v/v) solvent B” (0.1% [v/v] formic acid and 80% [v/v] acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min followed by a wash with 100% solvent B”.  LC-MS/MS Analysis and Peptide Identification--The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the 10 most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. In the LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fischer Scientific), full-scan MS spectra were acquired at a target value of 1E6 with a resolution of 60,000. The 10 most intense ions were isolated for fragmentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion of 20 s. Peptides were fragmented after filling the ion trap at a target value of 1E4 ion counts.

### Data Protocol
The MS/MS spectra were searched with the MAXQUANT software (version 1.4.0.3) (39, 40) against The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR10_pep_20101214 containing 27,416 protein-coding genes) database, with a precursor mass tolerance set at 10 ppm for the first search (used for nonlinear mass recalibration) and at 4.5 ppm for the main search. Methionine oxidation was searched as fixed modification, whereas variable modifications were set for pyroglutamate formation of amino-terminal glutamine and acetylation of the protein N-terminus. Mass tolerance on peptide precursor ions was fixed at 10 ppm and on fragment ions at 0.5 Da. The peptide charge was set to 2+,3+. The instrument was put on electrospray ionization-TRAP. EndoLysC was the selected protease, with one missed cleavage allowed; cleavage was accepted as well when lysine was followed by proline. Only peptides were withheld that ranked first and scored above the 99% confidence threshold score. 13C3-propionate and 12C3-propionate were used as heavy and light labels, respectively, with specificity for lysines and peptide N-termini. The feature “matching between runs” was activated. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein was set to 1% and the minimum peptide length was set to 7. All mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the PRIDE accession PXD001358.  Statistical Analysis of the Shotgun Proteomics Experiment— Each of the 1968 proteins were analyzed separately by fitting a linear mixed model of the following form:  Yijkl =  + i + gj + mk + tl + gmjk +gtjl + mtkl + gmtjkl + ijkl , partitioning the variation in protein abundances (Yijkl) into fixed genotype effects (WT and max2; represented by gi), treatment effects (mock and SL; represented by mk), time effects (0h, 9h and 24h for mock, 9h and 24h for SL; represented by tl) and all interaction effects, and random block effects, referring to the biological replicates. The genotype.treatment interaction effect is the one of highest importance because it assesses whether the difference in response between the two genotypes is affected by the treatment (averaged over the time series). Random block effects in the model were assumed to be independent and normally distributed with means zero and variance 2. The linear mixed model was fitted by the residual maximum likelihood (REML) approach as implemented in Genstat v17 (Payne, 2013). Significance of the fixed main and interaction effects was assessed by an F-test.   Examining the probability histogram for the treatment and genotype.treatment interaction effects, there are virtually no proteins significantly responding. The proportion of proteins close to zero are less than one would expect from a purely random set of results. Thus, we decided it is not worth fitting a False Discovery Rate to this set of results, as there are fewer than expected responding proteins, and have set the significance level  = 0.01. Only for genotype effects, the FDR has been calculated.
