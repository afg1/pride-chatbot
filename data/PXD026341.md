### Title
Acetylated proteomic identification of stored platelets

### Description
In this project, the protein acetylation levels in human platelets and in WT and SIRT3-/- mouse platelets during storage were examined.

### Sample Protocol
The human platelet were collected daily from day 0 to day 6 during storage. WT and SIRT3-/- mouse platelets were collected on day 0 and day 2 during storage. The protein in platelets at different storage time were digested by trypsin and mixed after TMT labeling. The acetylation peptides were enriched by anti-acetylated antibody conjugated beads and assayed by LC-MS.

### Data Protocol
The secondary mass spectral data were retrieved using MaxQuant (v1.5.2.8).Retrieval parameter setting: the database is SwissProt, adding a reverse library to calculate the false positive rate (FDR) due to random matching, and a common contaminant database was added to the database to eliminate the influence of contaminant proteins in the identification results.Enzyme digestion mode is set to Trypsin/P;Set the number of missed cutting bits as 4;The minimum length of peptide segment was set as 7 amino acid residues.Maximum number of peptide modifications Set to 5;The mass error tolerance of First search and Main search was set as 20 PPM and 5 PPM, respectively. The mass error tolerance of secondary fragment ions is 0.02Da.Set cysteine alkylation as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine,acetylation of N-terminal protein, acetylation of lysine as variable modifications. FDR of TMT- 6PLEX, protein identification and PSM identification were all set to 1%.
