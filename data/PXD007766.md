### Title
Proteomic characterisation of bovine and avian purified protein derivatives and identification of specific antigens for serodiagnosis of bovine tuberculosis

### Description
Bovine purified protein derivative (bPPD) and avian purified protein derivative (aPPD) arewidely used forbovine tuberculosis diagnosis. However, little is known about their qualitative and quantitative characteristics, which makes their standardisation difficult. In addition, bPPDcan give false-positive tuberculosis results because of sequence homologybetween Mycobacterium bovis andM. avium proteins. Here we used proteomics to characterisebPPD, aPPD and an immunopurifiedsubcomplexfrombPPD called P22.

### Sample Protocol
Trypsin digests of bPPD, aPPD and P22 were analysed by nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were immunised with bPPD or aPPD, and their serumwas tested by indirect ELISA for reactivity against these preparations as well as P22.

### Data Protocol
A total of617 proteins were identified in bPPD, 930 in aPPDand 116 in P22; 165 of these proteins were shared by bPPD and aPPD, and 43 were present in all three preparations. Candidate proteins that may cause cross-reactivity between bPPD and aPPDwere identified based on protein abundance and antigenic propensity. Serum reactivity experiments indicated that P22 may providegreater specificity than bPPD with similar sensitivity for serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.
