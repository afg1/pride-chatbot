### Title
The CASP3 Prodomain Regulates Human Cell Survival and Proliferation

### Description
CASPASE-3 (CASP3) is well known for its proteolytic function that mediates multiple key cell death-initiated processes and other related cellular processes. However, the possibility that CASP3 may also possess important additional non-catalytic functions in mammalian cells has remained largely unexplored. We now report the results of CASP3 knockdown, rescue, proteomic analysis and flow cytometry experiments initially in normal and malignant human mammary cells and later shown to extent to all other human cell types tested. The results reveal a new role of the CASP3 prodomain in regulating the cell cycle progression, survival, proliferation, and protein aggregate accumulation in all cells tested. The generality of these findings suggests that the ancestral pro-survival role of CASP3 in yeast persisted throughout evolution via a conservation of its prodomain, predating its later acquisition of an inherent catalytic property and subsequently preserved cell death control functions.

### Sample Protocol
Human mammary cells were first exposed to one or more vectors in SF-7 media supplemented with 5% FBS, which creates a hybrid DMEM/F12 (STEMCELL Technologies) as the base medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 µg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma). The cells obtained were then exposed to selected test and control vectors at ≤106 cells in 100 µl of SF-7 media supplemented with 5% FBS 37°C and 20% O2 for 3 days on tissue culture petri dishes coated with collagen for primary human mammary epithelial cells, and without collagen for human mammary cell lines. Lentiviral transduction was performed in liquid suspension cultures containing cells at a concentration of ≤106 cells in 100 µl of SF-7 media supplemented with 5% FBS. The cells were then washed twice with HF prior to being used for any subsequent experimental procedure. Because of the high level of heterogeneity in Fucci vector-transduced MCF10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, these were cloned directly by FACS 2-3 days after vector exposure and then following their expansion in vitro then transduced with shCASP3-BFP or shScr-BFP vectors and analyzed for mKO and mVenus expression by FACS. Non-mammary cell types were cultured for 2 days and then exposed to the lentiviral vectors overnight at a concentration of ≤106 cells in 1000µl culture media. The cells were washed twice with HF prior to being used for any subsequent experimental procedure. Samples were lysed individually using lysis buffer containing 500 mM Tris-Cl pH8, 2% (wt/vol) SDS (Bio-Rad, cat# 1610302), 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma, cat# T8787), 1% (vol/vol) NP-40 (Merck Millipore, cat# 492016), 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Scientific, cat# 15575020), 50 mM NaCl (Sigma, cat# S7653), 10 mM TCEP (Sigma, cat# C4706) and 40 mM CAA (Sigma, cat# C0267). The global proteome profiling was performed on an Thermofisher Orbitrap Eclipse MS using 11-multiplex Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) method.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS were searched against the UniProt reference proteome (24635 sequences, 2020/02/18) using Sequest HT algorithm through the Proteome Discoverer suite (v2.4, Thermo Scientific). Precursor and fragment ion tolerance were set to 20 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. Dynamic modifications included Oxidation (+15.995 Da, M), Acetylation (+42.011 Da, N-Term), and static modification included Carbamidomethyl (+57.021 Da, C) and TMT (+229.163 Da, K, N-Term). Peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs) were calculated using Percolator by searching the results against a decoy sequence set; only PSMs with FDR< 1% were retained in the analysis.
