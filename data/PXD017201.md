### Title
In-depth plasma proteomics in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or MAPK-inhibitors

### Description
Recent development of new therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and MAPK-inhibitors (MAPKis) have significantly improved the outcome in metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM). However, therapy response is limited to subgroups of patients and clinically useful predictive biomarkers for treatment outcome are lacking. To discover treatment-related systemic changes in plasma and potential biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes, we analysed 45 plasma samples from 24 patients with metastatic (stage IV) CM, using HiRIEF LC-MS/MS, collected before (pre-trm) and during treatment (trm). Of these, 27 samples were taken from 15 metastatic CM patients treated with ICIs (13 pre-trm and 14 trm samples; 12 matched) and 9 patients treated with MAPKis (9 matched). Matched samples were trm and pre-trm samples taken from the same individual before treatment and after the first cycle of treatment (before the second cycle). We have analysed the change in the plasma protein levels during treatment by comparing the plasma levels in the trm samples to the pre-trm samples, to detect treatment-induced alterations in the plasma proteome. We have analysed the patients treated with ICIs separately from the patients treated with MAPKis, to detect treatment-specific changes for both.

### Sample Protocol
Plasma samples were desalted and concentrated using centrifugal concentrator's tubes with 10 kDa cut-off membrane. The MARS14 column (Agilent) was used to remove fourteen interfering high-abundance proteins following the manufacturer’s instructions. After depletion, a buffer exchange and sample concentration step through centrifugal concentrators was performed. The sample clean-up was performed following the SP3 protocol with minor changes. The resulting peptides were labelled with TMT reagent 10 plex, accordingly manufacturers’ protocol. The TMT labelling scheme is described in the labelling_scheme.txt file. The HiRIEF pH range employed was 3–10, 24-cm-long IPG (immobilized pH gradient) gel-strip (P/N GE-17-6002-44, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Each peptide mixture set with 400 μg, was redissolved in 250 μl rehydration solution containing 8 M urea, 1% IPG Pharmalyte, pH 3–10 (P/N GE-17-0456-01, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The peptide mixture set was loaded on the IPG tray, the IPG strip was placed above and allowed to absorb the sample overnight. The gel bridge was applied at the cathode (acidic) end of the IPG strip, and IEF was run on an Ettan IPGphor (GE Healthcare) until at least 150 kV-h. After focusing was complete, a well-former with 72 wells was applied onto each strip, and liquid-handling robotics (GE Healthcare prototype) proceeded with peptide extraction and transferred the 72 fractions into a microtiter plate (96 wells, V-bottom, Corning cat. #3894), which was then dried in a SpeedVac. Prior to each LC-MS run of the 72 fractions, the auto sampler (Ultimate 3000 RSLC system, Thermo Scientific Dionex) dispensed 20 μl of mobile phase A (95% water, 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1% formic acid) into the corresponding well of the microtiter plate (96 well V-bottom, polypropylene, Greiner), mixed by aspirating/dispensing 10 μl ten times, and finally injected 10 μl into a C18 guard desalting column (Acclaim pepmap 100, 75 μm × 2 cm, nanoViper, Thermo). After 5 min of flow at 5 μl min−1 with the loading pump, the 10-port valve switched to analysis mode in which the NC pump provided a flow of 250 nL min−1 through the guard column. The slightly concave curved gradient (curve 6 in the Chromeleon software) then proceeded from 3% mobile phase B (90% acetonitrile, 5% DMSO, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid) to 45% B in 50 min followed by wash at 99% B and re-equilibration. Total LCMS run time was 74 min. We used a nano-EASY-Spray column (pepmap RSLC, C18, 2 μm bead size, 100 Å, 75 μm internal diameter, 50 cm long, Thermo) on the nano electrospray ionization (NSI) EASY-Spray source (Thermo) at 60 °C. Online LC-MS was performed using a hybrid Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). FTMS master scans with 70,000 resolution (and scan range 300–1600 m/z) were followed by data-dependent MS2 (35,000 resolution) on the top 5 ions using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalized collision energy. Precursors were isolated with a 2 m/z window. Automatic gain control (AGC) targets were 1e6 for MS1 and 1e5 for MS2. Maximum injection times were 100 ms for MS1 and 450 ms for MS2. The entire duty cycle lasted ~1.5 s. Dynamic exclusion was used with 60 s duration. Precursors with unassigned charge state or charge state 1,7,8, >8 were excluded. An underfill ratio of 1% was used.

### Data Protocol
Raw MS/MS files were converted to mzML format using msconvert from the ProteoWizard tool suite. Spectra were then searched in the Galaxy framework using tools from the Galaxy-P project, including MSGF+ (v10072) and Percolator (v2.10), where 8 subsequent HiRIEF search result fractions were grouped for Percolator target/decoy analysis. Peptide and PSM FDR were recalculated after merging the percolator groups of 8 search results into one result per TMT set. The reference database used was the human protein subset of ENSEMBL 80. Quantification of isobaric reporter ions was done using OpenMS project's IsobaricAnalyzer (v2.0). Quantification on reporter ions in MS2 was for both protein and peptide level quantification based on median of PSM ratios, limited to PSMs mapping only to one protein and with an FDR q-value < 0.01. FDR for protein level identities was calculated using the -log10 of best-peptide q-value as a score. The search settings included enzymatic cleavage of proteins to peptides using trypsin limited to fully tryptic peptides. TMT6 on lysine and peptide N-terminus and Carbamidomethylation of cysteine were specified as fixed modifications. The minimum peptide length was specified to be 6 amino acids. Variable modification was oxidation of methionine.
