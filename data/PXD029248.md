### Title
Study of peptides produced during proteasomal degradation of MBP (Myelin basic protein) and IGF-1 (insuline-like growth factor 1) in presence and absence of   PA28γ

### Description
In vitro degradation of MBP and chemically denatureted IGF-1 by 20S and PA28γ-20S proteasomes and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of the entire spectrum of peptides produced

### Sample Protocol
Chemical degradation, peptides desalting, nLC-ESI-MS analysis

### Data Protocol
Data analysis by MaxQuant and statistical analysis by Perseus

### Publication Abstract
PA28&#x3b3; is a nuclear activator of the 20S proteasome that, unlike the 19S regulatory particle, stimulates hydrolysis of several substrates in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner and whose exact biological functions and molecular mechanism of action still remain elusive. In an effort to shed light on these important issues, we investigated the stimulatory effect of PA28&#x3b3; on the hydrolysis of different fluorogenic peptides and folded or denatured full-length proteins by the 20S proteasome. Importantly, PA28&#x3b3; was found to dramatically enhance breakdown rates by 20S proteasomes of several naturally or artificially unstructured proteins, but not of their native, folded counterparts. Furthermore, these data were corroborated by experiments in cell lines with a nucleus-tagged myelin basic protein. Finally, mass spectrometry analysis of the products generated during proteasomal degradation of two proteins demonstrated that PA28&#x3b3; does not increase, but rather decreases, the variability of peptides that are potentially suitable for MHC class I antigen presentation. These unexpected findings indicate that global stimulation of the degradation of unfolded proteins may represent a more general feature of PA28&#x3b3; and suggests that this proteasomal activator might play a broader role in the pathway of protein degradation than previously believed.
