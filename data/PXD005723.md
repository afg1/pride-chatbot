### Title
New Roles for Vitamin B12 Regulation

### Description
Elucidation of new roles for vitamin B12 in regulation of folate, ubiquinone, and methionine metabolism

### Sample Protocol
Samples were digested with trypsin, then analyzed by LC-MS/MS

### Data Protocol
Data was searched with MSGF+ using PNNL's DMS Processing pipeline

### Publication Abstract
Only a small fraction of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-requiring organisms are able to synthesize B<sub>12</sub> de novo, making it a common commodity in microbial communities. Initially recognized as an enzyme cofactor of a few enzymes, recent studies have revealed additional B<sub>12</sub>-binding enzymes and regulatory roles for B<sub>12</sub> Here we report the development and use of a B<sub>12</sub>-based chemical probe to identify B<sub>12</sub>-binding proteins in a nonphototrophic B<sub>12</sub>-producing bacterium. Two unexpected discoveries resulted from this study. First, we identified a light-sensing B<sub>12</sub>-binding transcriptional regulator and demonstrated that it controls folate and ubiquinone biosynthesis. Second, our probe captured proteins involved in folate, methionine, and ubiquinone metabolism, suggesting that it may play a role as an allosteric effector of these processes. These metabolic processes produce precursors for synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Thereby, B<sub>12</sub> likely modulates growth, and by limiting its availability to auxotrophs, B<sub>12</sub>-producing organisms may facilitate coordination of community metabolism.
