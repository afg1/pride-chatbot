### Title
A rapid methods development workflow for high-throughput quantitative proteomic applications

### Description
we developed a workflow using data acquired from discovery proteomic experiments, retention time prediction, and standard-flow chromatography to rapidly develop targeted proteomic assays

### Sample Protocol
Proteins were extracted from various microorganisms using either methanol/chloroform extraction, or bead beating lysis methods. Tryptic peptides were generated through standard reduction/alkylation/insolution digestion protocol.

### Data Protocol
Samples prepared for shotgun proteomic experiments were analyzed by using an Agilent 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system. 20 μg Peptides were loaded onto a Sigma–Aldrich Ascentis Peptides ES-C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.7 μm particle size, operated at 60°C) via an Infinity Autosampler (Agilent Technologies) with Buffer A (0.1% formic acid in LC/MS grade water) flowing at 0.400 mL/min. Raw MS files from shotgun analysis were converted to mgf files and searched against corresponding protein database using Mascot search engine. Spectral libraries were generated through skyline software, and MRM quantitative data were also processed by skyline software.

### Publication Abstract
Recent improvements in the speed and sensitivity of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry systems have driven significant progress toward system-wide characterization of the proteome of many species. These efforts create large proteomic datasets that provide insight into biological processes and identify diagnostic proteins whose abundance changes significantly under different experimental conditions. Yet, these system-wide experiments are typically the starting point for hypothesis-driven, follow-up experiments to elucidate the extent of the phenomenon or the utility of the diagnostic marker, wherein many samples must be analyzed. Transitioning from a few discovery experiments to quantitative analyses on hundreds of samples requires significant resources both to develop sensitive and specific methods as well as analyze them in a high-throughput manner. To aid these efforts, we developed a workflow using data acquired from discovery proteomic experiments, retention time prediction, and standard-flow chromatography to rapidly develop targeted proteomic assays. We demonstrated this workflow by developing MRM assays to quantify proteins of multiple metabolic pathways from multiple microbes under different experimental conditions. With this workflow, one can also target peptides in scheduled/dynamic acquisition methods from a shotgun proteomic dataset downloaded from online repositories, validate with appropriate control samples or standard peptides, and begin analyzing hundreds of samples in only a few minutes.
