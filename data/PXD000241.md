### Title
Serine Hydrolases from E. Coli

### Description
Serine hydrolases from E. Coli cells were labelled with fluorophosphonate probe (ABP-probe): Intact cells labelling by adding probe to media: GPM77700012901 and GPM00300015270 Cell lysate labelling: GPM77700012904 and GPM77700012905 Blank sample (no probe addition): GPM77700012906 and GPM77700012909  2D-LC-MS experiment was done with C18-chromatography at pH10 for first dimension (0.66% AcN/min gradient). Fractions (1 min each) from the first dimension were collected and concatenated: 1,2,3 and 4: 00-EColi2DFASP 45,46 and 47: 99-EColi2DFASP 5 and 25: 01-EColi2DFASP 6 and 26: 02-EColi2DFASP 7 and 27: 03-EColi2DFASP 24 and 44: 20-EColi2DFASP  Concatenated fractions were dryed, redissolved in H2O-FA-AcN 97.9:0.1:2% and analysed with LC-MS using C18-chromatography at pH=2 as a second-dimension separation method. Combined datasearch results for 2D-LC-MS of E. Coli Dh5a could be seen on local laboratory server: http://140.193.59.4/tandem/thegpm_tandem.html with lookup model ID: GPM22200000195
