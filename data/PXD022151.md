### Title
IsoTOP-ABPP in Jurkat cells for cysteine reactivity profiling

### Description
Cysteine reactivity in Jurkat cell lines were assessed using IsoTOP-ABPP

### Sample Protocol
Jurkat cell lysate was labeled with 10uM or 100uM iodoacetamide alkyne and click-conjugated onto heavy and light isotopic tags with biotin enrichment handles. Samples were cleaned up using chloroform-methanol washes and enriched using streptavidin beads

### Data Protocol
The MS2 spectra data were extracted from the raw file using RAW Xtractor (version 1.1.0.22; available at http://fields.scripps.edu/rawconv/). MS2 spectra data were searched using the ProLuCID algorithm (publicly available at http://fields.scripps.edu/yates/wp/?page_id=17 using a reverse concatenated, nonredundant variant of the Human UniProt database (release-2020_01). Cysteine residues were searched with a static modification for carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146) and two differential modification at cysteine residues which are +464.28595,+470.29976 for light and heavy tags. Peptides were required to have at least one tryptic terminus and to contain the modification. ProLuCID data was filtered through DTASelect (version 2.0) to achieve a peptide false-positive rate below 1%.
