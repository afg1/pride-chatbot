### Title
Burkholderia thailandensis E264 proteome and its changes upon quorum sensing disruption

### Description
The proteome of Burkholderia thailandensis E264 was assessed by shotgun proteomics as well as the proteome of the strain after quorum sensing disruption.

### Sample Protocol
Protein samples were loaded on a SDS-PAGE for a short migration, excised from a single polyacrylamide band, digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed with a Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT against a database of Burkholderia thailandensis protein sequences, the results were then parsed, spectral counts were extracted and compared.
