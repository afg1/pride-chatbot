### Title
Identification of Pseudomanas fluorescens Fic auto-AMPylation site

### Description
This project has the aim of characterizing the function of the Fic-1 protein of Pseudomonas fluorescens.

### Sample Protocol
Purified Fic-1 protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, in-gel digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). The top ten most intense ions were targeted to fragmentation for 250 ms using rolling collision energy.

### Data Protocol
Spectra derived from MS/MS analysis of adenylylated peptides were manually inspected by searching for diagnostic fragments of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) breakdown: adenine (m/z 136.06), adenosine (m/z 250.09) and AMP (m/z 348.07). Then y and b series of the peptide backbone were analyzed to determine the peptide sequence and position of the modification.  Alternatively, data was processed with MaxQuant (1.4.0.8) and searched against the E. coli  reference proteome from Uniprot (downloaded on May 20, 2015. Searching parameters included: partial tryptic digestion, cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, and Protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation and serine/threonine/tyrosine AMPylation as variable modifications. Parameters for mass tolerances and idenfitication threshold was set as default.

### Publication Abstract
The morphology of bacterial cells is important for virulence, evasion of the host immune system, and coping with environmental stresses. The widely distributed Fic proteins (filamentation induced by cAMP) are annotated as proteins involved in cell division because of the presence of the HPFx[D/E]GN[G/K]R motif. We showed that the presence of Fic-1 from Pseudomonas fluorescens significantly reduced the yield of plasmid DNA when expressed in Escherichia coli or P. fluorescens. Fic-1 interacted with GyrB, a subunit of DNA gyrase, which is essential for bacterial DNA replication. Fic-1 catalyzed the AMPylation of GyrB at Tyr(109), a residue critical for binding ATP, and exhibited auto-AMPylation activity. Mutation of the Fic-1 auto-AMPylated site greatly reduced AMPylation activity toward itself and toward GyrB. Fic-1-dependent AMPylation of GyrB triggered the SOS response, indicative of DNA replication stress or DNA damage. Fic-1 also promoted the formation of elongated cells when the SOS response was blocked. We identified an &#x3b1;-inhibitor protein that we named anti-Fic-1 (AntF), encoded by a gene immediately upstream of Fic-1. AntF interacted with Fic-1, inhibited the AMPylation activity of Fic-1 for GyrB in vitro, and blocked Fic-1-mediated inhibition of DNA replication in bacteria, suggesting that Fic-1 and AntF comprise a toxin-antitoxin module. Our work establishes Fic-1 as an AMPylating enzyme that targets GyrB to inhibit DNA replication and may target other proteins to regulate bacterial morphology.
