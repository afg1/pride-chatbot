### Title
Identification of proteins that interacted with DPYSL2

### Description
Dihydropyrimidinase like 2 promotes bladder cancer progression via pyruvate kinase M2-induced aerobic glycolysis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. DPYSL2 promotes bladder cancer progression via PKM2.

### Sample Protocol
The Flag–DPYSL2 plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, Flag–DPYSL2 complexes were co-immunoprecipitated using an anti-Flag antibody. The Flag–DPYSL2 complexes was separated using SDS PAGE, and then was identified by combining silver staining and mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Results from TripleTOF 5600 with wiff format was handled by PEAKS Studio 8.5 (version 8.5, Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.Waterloo, Canada). The database was 20211 Homo sapiens proteins with fasta format from Uniprot Database.
