### Title
Chaperone-mediated autophagy maintains glioma stem cell activity controlling different proteomic and transcriptomic pathways

### Description
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a homeostatic process essential for the lysosomal degradation of individual proteins. CMA activity directly depends on the levels of LAMP2A, critical receptor at the lysosomal membrane, to which CMA substrate proteins are bound.  In glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain cancer in the adulthood, high levels of LAMP2A have been linked to TMZ resistance and tumor-associated pericytes. However, the implication of LAMP2A, and hence CMA, in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) remains unknown. In this work, we show that LAMP2A expression is enriched in patient-derived GSC population and its knock-down diminishes GSCs tumorigenic activities. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of LAMP2A knocked-down GSCs revealed reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction effectors in both analyses. Moreover, immune system and mitochondrial metabolism related pathways were remarkably deregulated at proteome level, whereas PI3K-AKT and p53 pathways were altered in RNAseq study. Moreover, clinical samples of GBM tissue presented overexpression of LAMP2 and its high levels correlated with advanced glioma grade and poor overall survival. In conclusion, we identified a novel role of CMA directly regulating GSCs activity via multiple pathways at proteome and transcriptome level.

### Sample Protocol
Samples were incubated in a sample containing 7M urea 2M Thiourea 4% CHAPS and 5mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature (RT) under agitation and digested following the filter-aided FASP protocol previously described 23 with minor modifications. Trypsin was added to a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:50, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37ºC, dried out in a RVC2 25 speedvac concentrator (Christ), and resuspended in 0.1% FA. Peptides were desalted and resuspended in 0.1% FA using C18 stage tips (Millipore).Samples were next analyzed in a novel hybrid trapped ion mobility spectrometry – quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (timsTOF Pro with PASEF, Bruker Daltonics) coupled online to a nanoElute liquid chromatograph (Bruker). Sample (200ng) was directly loaded in a 15 cm Bruker nanoelute FIFTEEN C18 analytical column (Bruker) and resolved at 400 nl/min with a 100 min gradient. Column was heated to 50ºC using an oven.

### Data Protocol
Protein identification and quantification was carried out using MaxQuant software using default settings. Searches were carried out against a database consisting of human protein entries (Uniprot/Swissprot), with precursor and fragment tolerances of 20ppm and 0.05 Da. Only proteins identified with at least two peptides at FDR<1% were considered for further analysis. Data was loaded onto Perseus platform 24 and further processed (log2 transformation, imputation). Significantly differential proteins (p<0.05), with a ratio>1.5 in either direction, were further analyzed by bioinformatic means.
