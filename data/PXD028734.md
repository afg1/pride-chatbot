### Title
Proteomes of Placenta from Pregnant Women with Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy

### Description
The iTRAQ analysis combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed to separate differentially expressed placental proteins from 4 pregnant women with ICP and 4 healthy pregnant women.

### Sample Protocol
To extract proteins from placental samples, frozen tissues were dissolved in a lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% (w/v) DTT and 1% (v/w) protease inhibitor cocktail. Trypsin digestion and iTRAQ labeling were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Labeling design of iTRAQ tags: 113, control-1; 114, control-2; 115, control-3; 116, control-4; 117, patient-1; 118, patient-2; 119, patient-3 and 121, patient-4. Labeled peptide mixtures were resuspended in SCX chromatography Buffer A (10 mM NH4COOH, 5% ACN, pH 2.7) and loaded onto a strong-cation exchange column for fractionation. The twenty fractions were sequentially loaded onto a mprecolumn TM cartridge at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The trap column effluent was then transferred to a reverse-phase microcapillary column. Peptide analysis was performed using LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled directly to a LC column. An MS survey scan was obtained for the m/z range 350–1800, and ion trap collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/ MS spectra were acquired from the survey scan for the 8 most intense ions, followed by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD)-MS3 fragmentation of the most intense fragment ion in an m/z range between 400–800 of each of the 8 most intense ions (as determined by Xcalibur mass spectrometer software in real time). Dynamic mass exclusion windows of 60 s were used; siloxane (m/z 445.120025) was used as lock mass.

### Data Protocol
The raw files were used to search the International Protein Index (IPI) human proteome database (version 3.83;93289 sequences) using MaxQuant (version 1.2.2.5). Enzyme specificity was set as Trypsin/P (no Proline restriction); the maximum number of missed cleavage sites permitted was two. The minimum peptide length required was six. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57 Da), and 8-Plex iTRAQ modification of N-term (+304 Da) and K (+304 Da) were set as fixed modifications, and oxidized methionine (+16 Da) was set as a variable modification. Mass tolerance for precursor ions and fragment ions were set to 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The site, peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDR) were set to 0.01. Protein quantification was calculated by combining the MaxQuant identification results with local Libra quantification algorithm.
