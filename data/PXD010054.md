### Title
Lactic acid bacterial LC-MS/MS

### Description
In this study, we set up a long-term adaptive evolution experiment and the compative proteomics analysis of the adapted strains was performed.

### Sample Protocol
Both the parental and descendent cells of the adapted strain were collected after 24 hours of cultivation in LSM. Protein extracts were prepared by lysing the collected cells with SDT lysate. LS-MS/MS analysis was performed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer Q Exactive that was coupled with Easy nLC.

### Data Protocol
Mascot 2.2 was used for database search and quantitative analysis. For the downstream quantitative analysis, the ion peak intensity of peptide was extracted and normalization processing was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4. The significantly differentially expressed proteins were screened by t-test and FDR < 0.05 were used as the cut-off threshold.
