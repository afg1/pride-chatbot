### Title
A comprehensive LFQ benchmark dataset to validate data analysis pipelines on modern day acquisition strategies in proteomics

### Description
A comprehensive LFQ benchmark dataset to validate data analysis pipelines on modern day acquisition strategies in proteomics using SCIEX TripleTOF5600 and 6600+, Orbitrap QE-HFX, Waters Synapt GS-Si and Synapt XS and Bruker timsTOF Pro.

### Sample Protocol
Two  hybrid proteome samples A and B containing known quantities of Human, Yeast and E.coli tryptic peptides, as described by Navarro et al. were prepared in three consequtive times to include handling variability. Additionally, a QC sample was created by mixing one sixth of each of the six master batches (65% w/w Human, 22.5% w/w Yeast and 12.5% w/w E.coli)These commercial lysates were measured individually and as triple hybrid proteome mixtures each in triplicate using DDA and DIA acquisition methodologies available on six LC-MS/MS platforms, i.e. SCIEX TripleTOF5600 and 6600+, Orbitrap QE-HFX, Waters Synapt GS-Si and Synapt XS and Bruker timsTOF Pro.

### Data Protocol
The analytical data has been analyzed with any software to enable future users to anlyzed with their own software.
