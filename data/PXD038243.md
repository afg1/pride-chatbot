### Title
The proteomic response to temperature in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi

### Description
The coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi was acclimated to growth under three temperatures (17, 23 and 28°C), representing control, sub-optimal and supra-optimal warming respectively. Shotgun proteomic analysis was utilised to examine the molecular mechanisms driving the cellular response of E. huxleyi to warming. This revealed a significant reprogramming of the cellular proteome in-line with existing data relating to the relative sensitivities of phytoplankton photosynthesis and respiration to increasing temperature.

### Sample Protocol
E. huxleyi cultures (150 mL) were collected by light centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were immediately flash-frozen using dry ice and stored at -20°C until further processing. Cell pellets were thawed at room temperature and subsequently lysed by sonication (6x 30 s, on ice) within 1 mL extraction buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). A Bradford assay was used to determine the concentration of protein present in each sample. The resultant cell lysate was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and stored at -20°C. In-solution trypsin digestion was carried out to digest 100 µg of protein from each sample. Briefly, proteins were denatured in 4 M urea in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min at room temperature under shaking (650 rpm). Following this, cysteines were reduced using 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30 min at room temperature, and subsequently alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for a further 30 min in the dark. Proteins were pre-digested using LysC at a ratio of 1 µg per 100 µg protein, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C under shaking (800 rpm). Urea concentrations were diluted to 2 M and CaCl2 added at a final concentration of 2 mM, before trypsin was added at a ratio of 2.5 µg for every 100 µg protein. The trypsin reaction was carried out for 20 h (37°C, 800 rpm) and stopped by the addition of 5% formic acid. Samples were desalted using a C18 column and dried overnight using a speed-vacuum, and stored at -20°C until analysis. Peptides were separated using nano liquid chromatography (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ultimate RSLC 3000) coupled with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an Easy-Spray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After separation, peptides were trapped onto a C18 PepMac100 precolumn (300 µm i.d.x5 mm, 100Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 0.1% formic acid diluted in HPLC grade water. Peptides was further separated using an Easy-Spray RSLC C18 column (75um i.d., 50cm length, Thermo Fisher Scientific) during a 60-minute linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (15-35%) at a flow rate of 200 nL min-1. Raw data was acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA). Full scan mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (Scan range 350-1500 m/z, resolution 70,000; AGC target, 36, maximum injection time, 50 ms). The 10 most intense peaks were selected for higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation at 30% of normalized collision energy. HCD spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at resolution 17,500, AGC target 54, maximum injection time 120 ms with fixed mass at 180 m/z. Charge exclusion was selected for unassigned and 1+ ions. The dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s.

### Data Protocol
MaxQuant version 2.0.3.0 was used to identify peptides from raw spectral files and carry out label-free quantification of proteins. To act as a reference for peptide identification the Uniprot reference proteome for E. huxleyi (UP000013827) was downloaded on the 21/02/22. Perseus version 1.6.15.0 was utilised for downstream data analysis. First, data was filtered to remove potential contaminants and identified proteins filtered to include only those present in three replicates of at least one treatment. Pair-wise T-tests (FDR≤0.01) were utilised to examine significant differences in abundance of individual proteins between each treatment.

### Publication Abstract
Marine phytoplankton contribute substantially to the global flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Sea surface temperatures will inevitably increase in line with global climate change, altering the performance of marine phytoplankton. Differing sensitivities of photosynthesis and respiration to temperature, will likely shift the strength of the future oceanic carbon sink. To further clarify the molecular mechanisms driving these alterations in phytoplankton function, shotgun proteomic analysis was carried out on the globally-occurring coccolithophore <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> exposed to moderate- (23&#xb0;C) and elevated- (28&#xb0;C) warming. Compared to the control (17&#xb0;C), growth of <i>E. huxleyi</i> increased under elevated temperatures, with higher rates recorded under moderate- relative to elevated- warming. Proteomic analysis revealed a significant modification of the <i>E. huxleyi</i> cellular proteome as temperatures increased: at lower temperature, ribosomal proteins and photosynthetic machinery appeared abundant, as rates of protein translation and photosynthetic performance are restricted by low temperatures. As temperatures increased, evidence of heat stress was observed in the photosystem, characterized by a relative down-regulation of the Photosystem II oxygen evolving complex and ATP synthase. Acclimation to elevated warming (28&#xb0;C) revealed a substantial alteration to carbon metabolism. Here, <i>E. huxleyi</i> made use of the glyoxylate cycle and succinate metabolism to optimize carbon use, maintain growth and maximize ATP production in heat-damaged mitochondria, enabling cultures to maintain growth at levels significantly higher than those recorded in the control (17&#xb0;C). Based on the metabolic changes observed, we can predict that warming may benefit photosynthetic carbon fixation by <i>E. huxleyi</i> in the sub-optimal to optimal thermal range. Past the thermal optima, increasing rates of respiration and costs of repair will likely constrain growth, causing a possible decline in the contribution of this species to the oceanic carbon sink depending on the evolvability of these temperature thresholds.
