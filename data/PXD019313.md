### Title
histone modification signatures in mice melanoma progression

### Description
In the search for the biological mechanisms that underlie melanoma development, we have developed a cellular system that models tumor initiation and transformation from melanocytes to metastatic melanoma cells.. To evaluate histone PTM, we applied a workflow to globally detect histone PTM by mass spectrometry approaches allowing the interrogation of more than 40 PTMs sites and 200 PTMs combinations.

### Sample Protocol
Histones were extracted, proprionylated (chemical derivatization), trypsin digested, analyzed by MS/MS using DIA analysis.

### Data Protocol
We searched the DIA data using EPiprofile (mouse database).
