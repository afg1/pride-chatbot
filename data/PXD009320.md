### Title
Bovine Longissimus thoracis muscle HDMSE with differents ultimate pH

### Description
The purpose of this research was to investigate the causes and consequences of pHu variations in beef cattle. For that, were evaluated 176 Nellore beef cattle, and classified into two different pHu groups: High (≥6.0, N=17) and Normal (<5.8, N=159). Plasma concentrations of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, lactate and glycogen muscular content, meat color, shear force and Longissimus thoracis muscle proteomic profile were evaluated and compared between pHu groups. Muscle glycogen content, meat color and shear force statistically differed between pHu groups. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed ten differentially abundant proteins between pHu groups, involved in metabolic processes and muscle contraction. Thirty-six and 31 proteins were exclusively present in Normal and High pHu group, respectively, which were related to TCA cycle, cortisol production, calcium regulation, and antioxidant function. The MYH7, UGP2, and VDAC3 were identified as potential indicators of pHu variations. CALM and NNT appeared to be interesting proteins to better understand the metabolic pathways behind pHu.

### Sample Protocol
Longissimus thoracis muscle samples from Nelore cattle were collected at 24 hour postmortem and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. We selected 6 samples with higher ultimate pH (pH≥6.0), and 6 samples with normal ultimate pH (pH<5.8) to proteomic analysis. Frozen muscle tissue (0.5 g) was homogenized in 2 mL of an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 1 % DTT, 2 % CHAPS and 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail with a polytron. Crude extracts were vigorously shaken for 30 min at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 10 000 x g for 30 min at 4ºC (Bouley et al., 2005). The supernatant was harvested and protein concentration determined as described in the PlusOne 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare). Protein extracts previously resuspended in lysis buffer were desalinized using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL 3K-NMWL filter devices (Millipore, Ireland).  After, the total protein concentration was determined using a Bradford Protein Assay kit (Bio Rad). For trypsin digest, 50 µl of each sample (1 µg/µl) was denatured with 25 µL of 0.2% RapiGest SF Surfactant solution (Waters Corporation, USA), reduced with 2.5 µL of 100 mM dithiothreitol (GE Healthcare) and alkylated with 2.5 µL of 300 mM iodoacetamide (GE Healthcare). For the digestion, trypsin (Promega) was added at a protein ration of 1:100 (w/w). The peptide mixture were desalted using Zip Tip Reversed-Phase C18 columns, P10 (Millipore) and drying down in a vacuum centrifuge. All samples were stored at -80°C. Previously MSE analysis, lyophilized peptide samples were resuspended in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) solution containing 1 pM rabbit phosphorylase (P00489 - internal standard for data normalization and label-free protein quantification). Mass spectra of the peptide fragments were acquired by bidimensional nanoUPLC tandem nanoESI-HDMSE technology system. First dimension separation was achieved in an XBridge BEH130 C18 5 µm 300 µm x 50 mm nanoflow column. The peptides were eluted using five different binary gradients of 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in acetonitrile at 400 nL/min. Eluted peptides from the first dimension column were trapped in a Symmetry C18 5 µm, 180 µm x 20 mm column (Waters, Manchester, UK) and diluted with acetonitrile containing 0.1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 2 µL/min. Second dimension separation was performed in an HSS T3 1.8 µm, 75 µm x 100 mm column using a binary gradient from 3 to 85 % acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 350 nL/min for 52 min. Mass spectrometry acquisition was achieved using a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with an ion mobility cell and a NanoLockSpray source in the positive ion and ‘V’ mode. The doubly charged ion ([M + 2H]2+) was used for the initial single-point calibration, and the MS/MS fragment ions of [Glu 1]-Fibrinopeptide B (Sigma-Aldrich) with a [M + 2H]2+ = 785.8426 m/z was used as lock mass to obtain the final instrument calibration. Lock mass channel was sampled every 30 s. Data-independent scanning (MSE) experiments were performed by switching between low (3 eV), and elevated collision energies (15–50 eV) applied to the trap ‘T- wave’ CID (collision-induced dissociation) cell filled with argon gas. Scan time of 0.8 s was used for low and high energy scans from m/z 50 to 2000.

### Data Protocol
MSE data were processed using ProteinLynx Global Server version 2.5.1 (PLGS, Waters Corporation) software platform. Data processing included lock mass correction window of 0.4 Daltons post-acquisition and operating the instrument at a resolution of at least 10,000 FWHM. Protein identifications were obtained with the embedded ion accounting algorithm of PLGS software searching into the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Bos taurus and Bos indicus database reverse (36,282 and 1,062 unreviewed entries, respectively, downloaded January 2016) to which the sequence of rabbit phosphorylase (P00489) was appended. Parameters for the database search were: automatic tolerance for precursor and product ions, minimum 2 fragment ions matched per peptide, minimum 5 fragment ions matched per protein, minimum 2 peptides matched per protein, 1 missed cleavage, trypsin as digestion enzyme, carbamidomethylation of cysteines and oxidation of methionine as fixed and variable modifications. False positive discovery rate (FDR) of the identification algorithm was set to 4% for database search in PLGS, which was determined based on the pursuit of a reversed database generated automatically using PLGS 2.5.1 by reversing the sequence of each entry. Intensity measurements were achieved by a label-free approach, considering the intensity of the identified precursor ion (Levin et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009). For this, PGLS processing parameters were set as follows: noise reduction thresholds for low energy scan ion - 100 counts, high energy scan ion - 30 counts and peptide intensity - 750 counts. The data were normalized based on the internal standard (digested rabbit phosphorylase - P00489) that was added to each sample using the PLGS “auto normalization” function. Protein quantification was performed by the average of the three most intense tryptic peptides of a given protein, and absolute quantities were calculated using the stoichiometric method, according to the concentration of internal standard during MSE analysis (Silva, Gorenstein, Li, Vissers, & Geromanos, 2006).

### Publication Abstract
The purpose of this research was to investigate the causes and consequences of pHu variations in beef cattle. A group of 176 Nellore beef cattle was evaluated and classified into two different pHu groups: High (&#x2265;6.0, N&#x202f;=&#x202f;17) and Normal (&lt;5.8, N&#x202f;=&#x202f;159). Plasma concentrations of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, lactate and glycogen muscular content, meat color, shear force and Longissimus thoracis muscle proteomic profile were evaluated and compared between pHu groups. Muscle glycogen content, meat color and shear force statistically differed between pHu groups. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed ten differentially abundant proteins between pHu groups, involved in metabolic processes and muscle contraction, which also were significantly correlated with pHu. Thirty-six and 31 proteins were exclusively present in Normal and High pHu group, respectively, which were related to TCA cycle, cortisol production, calcium regulation, and antioxidant function. The MYH7, UGP2, H2AFJ and VDAC3 were identified as potential indicators of pHu variations. CALM and NNT appeared to be interesting proteins to understand the metabolic pathways behind pHu. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009320.
