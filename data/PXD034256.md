### Title
FASII antibiotic adaptation reprograms Staphylococcus aureus behavior

### Description
Proving functionality in the host environment is a crucial step in antimicrobial development pipelines. Antibiotics targeting fatty acid synthesis (FASII) of the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus actively inhibit FASII but do not prevent in vivo growth, as bacteria compensate the FASII block by using environmental fatty acids. We used proteomics and phosphoproteomics to elucidate S. aureus responses to anti-FASII in host-relevant conditions. S. aureus responded to anti-FASII treatment in serum by massive reprogramming. A striking inverse correlation was observed in anti-FASII-adapted S. aureus, between amounts of stress response proteins that increase, and virulence factors that decrease. These findings suggest that anti-FASII adapted cells might be better prepared for survival and less equipped to damage the host. Infection by anti-FASII-adapted versus non-treated S. aureus was challenged in the Galleria mellonella model. Time to mortality was longer in insects infected by anti-FASII-treated bacteria compared to those infected by non-treated S. aureus. However, bacterial counts in infected dead insects were comparable for both groups. These results support the hypothesis that higher stress response and lower virulence factor expression, as shown here in FASII-antibiotic-adapted bacteria, may set the stage for persistent infection

### Sample Protocol
Experiments were performed using S. aureus SAUSA300_FPR3757 JE2 strain, referred to below as USA300. Comparison of 6 conditions (from which 2 conditions with 5 time points). Four independent biological replicates each condition :  BHI (Medium BHI)  Control at O.D = 1.2, approximately at 2h/ BHI-T (Medium BHI + Triclosan ) Control at O.D = 0,5, at 6h/FA (BHI + Fatty acids ) Control at O.D = 1.5, approximately at 3h/ SFA (BHI + Fatty acids + Serum)  Control at O.D = 1.3,approximately at 2h/FAT (BHI + Fatty acids + Triclosan) Kinetic of 5 time points (2h, 4h,6h, 8h, 10h) at O.D = 0,5-0,6/SFAT (BHI + Fatty acids + Serum + Triclosan ) Kinetic of 5 time points (2h, 4h,6h, 8h, 10h) at O.D = 0,5 – 2,8  Proteins analysis :  Protein quantification was performed on samples from the 14 conditions in quadruplicate (56 samples total) by Bradford method using Bio-Rad Protein assay dye. For each sample, 10 µg total protein were loaded on a short run SDS-PAGE.4µL per sample (approximately 800 ng of peptides) were injected iinto a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC system coupled to an Orbitrap FusionTM LumosTM TribridTM mass spectrometer (Thermo).MS2 was performed in CID mode in the trap.
