### Title
Discovery and validation of novel protein biomarkers in ovarian cancer patient urine

### Description
Diagnosis of ovarian cancer at an early stage is the most important determinant of survival. Thus, there is a clear need for novel biomarkers to improve diagnostic and prognostics that may better inform on therapeutic strategies. We have conducted a discovery study using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (LFQ) to identify potential biomarker candidates in urine from individual ovarian cancer patients. LFQ analyses identified 4394 proteins (16397 peptides) in urine samples (n=20), 23 of which were significantly elevated in the malignant patient group compared to patients with benign disease. To validate these changes, we used Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) to investigate their abundance in an independent cohort (n=20) of patient urine samples. Seven of the ten proteins were significantly enriched in the ovarian cancer patient samples; amongst these were established ovarian cancer markers WFDC2 (HE4) and Mesothelin (MSLN), validating our approach. This is the first application of a LFQ-PRM workflow to identify and validate ovarian cancer-specific biomarkers in urine samples.
