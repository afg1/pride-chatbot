### Title
TcdB of Clostridioides difficile mediates necrosis in epithelial cells and is depend on RAS

### Description
A Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection worldwide. The main virulence factors are TcdA and TcdB, which inhibit small Rho-GTPases. Inhibition of small Rho-GTPases leads to the so-called cytopathic effect, a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, an impairment of the colon epithelium barrier function, and inflammation. Additionally, TcdB induces a necrotic cell death termed pyknosis in vitro independently from its glucosyltransferas-es characterized by chromatin condensation and ROS production. To understand the underlying mechanism of this pyknotic effect, we conducted a large-scale phosphoproteomic study. We in-cluded the analysis of alterations in the phosphoproteome after treatment with TcdA, that was investigated for the first time. TcdA exhibit no glucosyltransferase-independent effect and was, thus, a good control to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the glucosyltransferase inde-pendent effect of TcdB. We found RAS to be a central upstream regulator for the glucosyltrans-ferase independent effect of TcdB. Inhibition of RAS leads to a 68% reduction in necrosis. Further analysis revealed apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) as a possible crucial factor of CDI induced in-flammation in vivo.

A <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection worldwide. The main virulence factors of pathogenic <i>C. difficile</i> are TcdA and TcdB, which inhibit small Rho-GTPases. The inhibition of small Rho-GTPases leads to the so-called cytopathic effect, a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, an impairment of the colon epithelium barrier function and inflammation. Additionally, TcdB induces a necrotic cell death termed pyknosis in vitro independently from its glucosyltransferases, which are characterized by chromatin condensation and ROS production. To understand the underlying mechanism of this pyknotic effect, we conducted a large-scale phosphoproteomic study. We included the analysis of alterations in the phosphoproteome after treatment with TcdA, which was investigated for the first time. TcdA exhibited no glucosyltransferase-independent necrotic effect and was, thus, a good control to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the glucosyltransferase-independent effect of TcdB.
