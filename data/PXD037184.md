### Title
An RNA granule for translation quality control  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

### Description
Cytoplasmic RNA granules compartmentalize phases of the translation cycle in eukaryotes. We previously reported the localization of oxidized RNA to cytoplasmic foci called oxidized RNA bodies (ORBs) in human cells. We show here that ORBs are RNA granules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several lines of evidence support a role of ORBs in the compartmentalization of no-go decay and ribosome quality control, the translation quality control pathways that recognize and clear aberrant mRNAs, including those with oxidized bases. Translation is required by these pathways and ORBs. Translation quality control factors localize to ORBs. A substrate of translation quality control, a stalled mRNA-ribosome-nascent chain complex, localizes to ORBS. Translation quality control mutants have altered ORB numbers, sizes, or both. In addition, we identify 68 ORB proteins, by immunofluorescence staining directed by proteomics, which further support their role in translation quality control and reveal candidate new factors for these pathways.

### Sample Protocol
Purified ORB proteins were concentrated in a stacking gel using SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Biorad). Proteins in the excised gel band were subjected to in-gel digestion as follows. Gel pieces were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (Sigma) + 10 mM dithiothreitol to reduce the proteins and then for 30 min at room temperature with 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 50 mM Iodoacetamide (SIGMA) in the dark to alkylate them. Gel dehydration was done with a series of acetonitrile (ACN, BDH) washes. Gel pieces were rehydrated in trypsin digestion solution containing 25 mM NH4HCO3 and 10 ng/μL of trypsin (Sigma) followed by incubation overnight at 30oC. Tryptic peptides were extracted three times for 15 min at room temperature with extraction solution (60% acetonitrile + 0.5% formic acid (FA, Fisher), four volumes of the digestion solution). Peptides were dried using a Speedvac at 43oC and stored at -20oC until MS analysis. Liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed on a Thermo EASY nLC II LC system coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source. Tryptic peptides were resuspended in solubilization solution containing 97% of water, 2% of ACN and 1% of FA to give a peptide concentration of 100ng/µL. 2 μL of each sample were injected into a 10 cm × 75 μm column that was in-house packed with Michrom Magic C18 stationary phase (5 μm particle diameter and 300 Å pore size). Peptides were eluted using a 90-min gradient at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with mobile phase A (96.9% water, 3% ACN and 0.1% FA) and B (97% ACN, 2.9% water and 0.1% FA). The gradient started at 2% of B, linear gradients of B were achieved to 8% at 16 min, 16% at 53 min, 24% at 69 min, 32% at 74 min, 54% at 81 min, 87% at 84 min followed by an isocratic step at 87% for 3 min and at 2% for 3 min. A full MS spectrum (m/z 400-1400) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000, then the ten most abundant multiple charged ions were selected for MS/MS sequencing in linear trap with the option of dynamic exclusion. Peptide fragmentation was performed using collision induced dissociation at normalized collision energy of 35% with activation time of 10 ms. Spectra were internally calibrated using polycyclodimethylsiloxane (m/z 445.12003 Da) as a lock mass.

### Data Protocol
The MS data were processed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (v2.2) with the SEQUEST search engine. The enzyme for database search was chosen as trypsin (full) and maximum missed cleavage sites were set at 2. Mass tolerances of the precursor ion and fragment ion were set at 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. Static modification on cysteine (carbamidomethyl, +57.021 Da) and dynamic modifications on methionine (oxidation, +15.995 Da) and N-terminus (acetyl, +42.011 Da) were allowed. The initial list contained 1048 proteins identified with high confidence (false discovery rate <1%) and from combining three biological replicates. Of this list we retained 822 proteins according to criteria stated in the results section.

### Publication Abstract
Cytoplasmic RNA granules compartmentalize phases of the translation cycle in eukaryotes. We previously reported the localization of oxidized RNA to cytoplasmic foci called oxidized RNA bodies (ORBs) in human cells. We show here that ORBs are RNA granules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several lines of evidence support a role for ORBs in the compartmentalization of no-go decay and ribosome quality control, the translation quality control pathways that recognize and clear aberrant mRNAs, including those with oxidized bases. Translation is required by these pathways and ORBs. Translation quality control factors localize to ORBs. A substrate of translation quality control, a stalled mRNA-ribosome-nascent-chain complex, localizes to ORBs. Translation quality control mutants have altered ORB numbers, sizes or both. In addition, we identify 68 ORB proteins by immunofluorescence staining directed by proteomics, which further support their role in translation quality control and reveal candidate new factors for these pathways.
