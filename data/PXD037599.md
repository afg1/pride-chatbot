### Title
Proteomics and constraint-based modelling reveal enzyme kinetic properties of C. reinhardtii on a genome-scale

### Description
Here we generated protein abundance data, covering between 2337 and 3708 proteins, from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells grown in various experiments and employed them with constraint-based metabolic models to estimate in vivo maximum apparent turnover numbers for this model organism.

### Sample Protocol
). As control cultivation conditions for C. reinhardtii CC1690 cells, cultures were grown for 48 hours in Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) medium using a rotatory shaker operating at 2 turns per second, while being constantly illuminated at 100 µmol photons m−2 s −1 at and held at 24°C. Datasets differing from control conditions were created by alteration of listed growth parameters.After cell harvesting and protein extraction, all samples were spiked with a master mix of Chlamydomonas specific QConCAT proteins, digested tryptically, and analyzed via LC-MS/MS (Eksigent nanoLC 425 coupled to a TripleTOF 6600, ABSciex) as described in Hammel et al., 2020.

### Data Protocol
Quantitative analysis of MS/MS measurements was performed using ProteomIQon 0.0.7 . Peptide searches were performed upon the assembly of a peptide database based of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteome based on version JGI5.5 of the C. reinhardtii genome blended with the sequences of spiked-in QconCAT proteins. The search space included methionine oxidation and acetylation of protein N termini as variable modifications and was extended by 15N-labeled variants of Chlamydomonas proteins. False discovery rate thresholds for peptide spectrum matches and protein group identifications were set to 1%.
