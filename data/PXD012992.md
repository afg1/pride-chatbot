### Title
Proteomic characterization of LDIP mutant phenotypes in  Arabidopsis seedlings

### Description
Lipid droplets (LDs) are unique, protein-coated organelles found in all eukaryotic organisms that function primarily in the storage of energy-rich neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TAGs). In plants, LDs are found in high abundance in oilseeds, and proteins involved in their formation and activity, such as oleosins, have been well-characterized. Our understanding of LD biogenesis and activity in other cell types, as well as the proteins that regulate these processes, is not as comprehensive. We recently identified and characterized a novel Arabidopsis LD coat protein termed LDIP (LDAP-interacting protein) that regulates LD size and neutral lipid homeostasis in leaf and seed embryonic cells. Here, we show that LDIP plays a distinct role in regulating LD size during biogenesis in leaf cells via interactions with key biogenetic proteins. Localization experiments performed in both plant and insect cells revealed LDIP is necessarily recruited to the LD surface by LDAP3 and binds nascent LDs during early-stage LD formation. Pull-down and Y2H assays indicate LDIP interacts with the biogenetic proteins SEIPINs, while combinatory expression levels of these proteins resulted in aberrant LD size and number in both plant cells and yeast. Evidence is also provided that LDIP plays a key role in modulating phospholipid levels in both leaves and seeds. Taken together, our data allow for the generation of model for LD biogenesis in non-seed cell types.

### Sample Protocol
Two hundred and fifty milligrams of Arabidopsis seeds (Col-0; ldip KD, SALK_84555; and ldip KO, SAIL_335_H11), were sterilized and stratified for 3 d in the dark at 4°C and then grown for 40 h in long-day conditions at 22°C on ½ MS medium plates without sucrose. Seedlings were ground in sand and 4 mL of grinding buffer [10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM Lohman’s reagent and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma- Aldrich)] for 1 min with a mortar and pestle. The resulting homogenate was spun for 10 s at 100 g and a 100 μL aliquot of the supernatant (‘total cell protein’ sample) was precipitated in 90% (v/v) ethanol at - 20°C. The rest of the supernatant was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the resulting fat pad was washed twice with grinding buffer and finally delipidated in ethanol at -20°C. The protein pellet (‘LD-enriched fraction’ sample) was washed twice with ethanol, dried and resuspended in 6 M SDS and 5% (w/v) urea. Protein concentrations were determined with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ten micrograms of protein were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel until it entered into the separation gel. The Coomassie blue-stained protein bands were then excised and processed as described by Shevchenko et al. (1996). Peptides were desalted over a Supelco C18 column (Sigma-Aldrich) according to Rappsilber et al. (2007) and then subjected to LC-MS/MS (Schmitt et al., 2017).

### Data Protocol
Protein levels were calculated using the intensity-based quantification (iBAQ) label-free algorithm (Schaab et al., 2012) or the label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm (Cox et al. 2014) implemented in the MaxQuant software (Version 1.5.8.3) and the values were calculated as per mille of all values in one sample.

### Publication Abstract
Cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved organelles that store neutral lipids and play critical roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain obscure. Here we show that a recently identified protein termed LD-associated protein [LDAP]-interacting protein (LDIP) works together with both endoplasmic reticulum-localized SEIPIN and the LD-coat protein LDAP to facilitate LD formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous expression in insect cells demonstrated that LDAP is required for the targeting of LDIP to the LD surface, and both proteins are required for the production of normal numbers and sizes of LDs in plant cells. LDIP also interacts with SEIPIN via a conserved hydrophobic helix in SEIPIN and LDIP functions together with SEIPIN to modulate LD numbers and sizes in plants. Further, the co-expression of both proteins is required to restore normal LD production in SEIPIN-deficient yeast cells. These data, combined with the analogous function of LDIP to a mammalian protein called LD Assembly Factor 1, are discussed in the context of a new model for LD biogenesis in plant cells with evolutionary connections to LD biogenesis in other eukaryotes.
