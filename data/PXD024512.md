### Title
Proteomics based analysis for associated PD-L1 in macrophage stimulated with extracellular adenosine signaling

### Description
We performed proteomics analysis to discover effector proteins for the post-transcriptional regulation of PD-L1 onhuman macrophages stimulated by adenosine signal.

### Sample Protocol
We analyzed proteins that differentially bound to PD-L1 protein in adenosine treated macrophages compared to untreated macrophages through immunoprecipitation based liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (IP-LC/MS analysis)

### Data Protocol
Gels were divided and sliced into seven fractions according to molecular weight. After the gels were washed with distilled water, tryptic digestion was performed in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 12–16 h. Digested peptides should be dried and stored until analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Dissolved tryptic peptides with a solution A (0.1% formic acid) loaded on to 100 μm × 2 cm nanoviper trapping column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Concentrated tryptic peptides were eluted from the column and directed into a 15 cm × 75 μm I.D. C18 reverse phase column at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 5–55% acetonitrile for 80 min. All MS and MS/MS spectra obtained using the LTQ-velos ion trap mass spectrometer were acquired in data-dependent mode (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For protein identification, MS/MS spectra were searched using MASCOT version 2.6 (Matrix Science, UK) using human protein database which downloaded from Unirprot (Proteome ID: UP000005640).
