### Title
ULK1 as a novel therapeutic target to enhance immune checkpoint therapies against melanoma

### Description
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of melanoma. However, the majority of patients have primary or acquired resistance to ICIs, limiting durable responses and patient survival. Interferon-gamma (IFNg) signaling and the expression of IFNg-stimulated genes correlate with either response or resistance to ICIs, in a context-dependent manner. While IFNg-inducible immunostimulatory genes are required for response to ICIs, chronic IFNg signaling induces the expression of immunosuppressive genes, promoting resistance to these therapies. Here, we show that high levels of ULK1 correlate with poor survival in melanoma patients and overexpression of ULK1 in melanoma cells enhances IFNg-induced expression of immunosuppressive genes, with minimal effects on the expression of immunostimulatory genes. In contrast, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 reduces expression of IFNg-induced immunosuppressive genes. ULK1 binds IRF1 in the nuclear compartment of melanoma cells, controlling its binding to the PD-L1 promoter region. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy further reduces melanoma tumor growth and enhances anti-tumor immune responses in vivo. Our data suggest that targeting ULK1 represses IFNg-dependent immunosuppression. These findings support the combination of ULK1 drug-targeted inhibition with ICIs for the treatment of melanoma patients to improve response rates and patient outcomes.

### Sample Protocol
For mass spectrometry analysis, 1750 μg of nuclear cell lysates and 2800 μg of cytoplasmic cell lysates from each treatment condition (untreated, 10 minutes IFNgamma and 4 hours IFNgamma treatments) were used for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of endogenous ULK1-protein complexes. Cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation with ULK1 (D8H5) rabbit monoclonal antibody conjugated to sepharose beads (20 μl/mg nuclear proteins and 15 μl/mg cytosolic proteins) (Cell Signaling Technology, custom order). As negative control, the same procedure was followed using rabbit (DA1E) monoclonal antibody IgG XP Isotype control conjugated to sepharose beads (Cell Signaling Technology #3423) instead of ULK1 antibody. After co-IP, the beads were washed three times with NP-40 lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 180 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EGTA and 0.1% NP-40). Protein-ULK1 complexes were eluted from the beads by incubation with Lane Marker Reducing Sample Buffer (Pierce) at 95°C for 10 minutes. IP-eluted proteins were initially separated using SDS-PAGE and the gel then cut into 10 equivalent height bands before standard in-gel digestion70. Resulting peptides were extracted from the gel pieces and desalted using solid-phase extraction on a Pierce C18 Spin column, before elution in 40 μL of 80% acetonitrile in 0.2% formic acid. After lyophilization, peptides were reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid in water and injected onto a trap column (150 μm; inner diameter [ID] by 3 cm) coupled with a nanobore analytical column (75 μm; ID by 15 cm; both ReproSil-Pur C18-aQ, 3 μm. Samples were separated using a linear gradient of solvent A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (5% water, 95% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid) over 60 min. nLC-MS/MS data were obtained on a Velos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer.

### Data Protocol
Data were searched using Mascot 2.5 (Matrix Science, http://www.matrixscience.com/index.html) against the human SwissProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed:yes) to identify the proteins processed by nLC-MS/MS, and results were reported at 1% false-discovery rate in Scaffold 4 (Proteome Software).
