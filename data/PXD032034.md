### Title
An Amphipathic Helix in Brl1 is Required for Nuclear Pore Complex Biogenesis in S. cerevisiae - Lysate intermixing text (DIA)

### Description
The project was aimed at assessing the dynamic protein exchange of the nuclear pore complex during the affinity purification procedure with Brl1 and Nup170 bait. In brief, equal fractions of an affinity tagged strain grown in unlabeled medium and a wild-type culture grown in metabolically labeled medium were subjected to the affinity purification procedure. The metabolic labeling in the affinity purified fraction stems from dynamic exchange during the affinity purification procedure (Tackett et al. 2005).

### Sample Protocol
Endogenously tagged Nup170 or Brl1 strains grown in medium containing light lysine were mixed with an equal amount of wild-type culture grown in heavy lysine medium and subjected to the affinity purification procedure. For the Nup170 lysis intermixing experiments, Brl1 was either inducible degraded by auxin addition for 5 h or cultures were treated with a solvent control. The samples were electrophoretically concentrated and processed for MS analysis using a standard in-gel digestion protocol. The mass spectrometry acquisition was performed on a Thermo Q Exactive Plus in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode for library generation and in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode for quantification. For more details see the materials and methods section of the associated publication.

### Data Protocol
Two Hybrid spectral libraries were generated with Spectronaut v.15 (Biognosys AG) using the combination of 20 DDA and 30 DIA datasets originating from APs with 10 NUP baits (Onischenko et al. 2020), and 4 DIA and 6 DDA datasets from Brl1 and Nup170 bait APs acquired in this study. The label-free assay library contained b and y transition ions (for a total of 3’918 protein groups, 75’780 precursors and 105’089 transitions). The SILAC assay library comprised y transitions only, with the heavy-channel (K+8.014199) generated in silico using the “inverted spike in” workflow (for a total of 3’825 protein groups, 97’069 precursors). Only tryptic peptides with a maximum of two missed cleavages were considered. Carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation was set as variable modification. Spectra were searched against the SGD protein database (downloaded on 13.10.2015, 6’713 entries) concatenated with entries for contaminants and iRT peptides using a 1% FDR control at peptide and protein level. The label-free and SILAC DIA datasets were extracted with the respective spectral libraries using Spectronaut v.15 (Biognosys AG). Default settings were used for the chromatogram extraction, except the machine learning option was set to “across experiment” and “cross run normalization” was excluded. The ion intensities at the fragment level were exported for further analysis in R.
