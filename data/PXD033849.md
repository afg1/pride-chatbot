### Title
SMARCA2, VHL Binary and Ternary Complex formation with ACBi1, PROTAC1, and PROTAC2

### Description
Interrogration of impacts on Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange of ligand binding using heterobifunctional molecules ACBi1(SiTX-0038406), PROTAC1(SiTX-0038404) and PROTAC2(SiTX-0038405) on target proteins SMARCA2 and VHL both in the binary and Ternary modes.

### Sample Protocol
Our HDX analyses were performed as reported previously with minor modifications~\cite{10.1074/jbc.m116.773499,10.1073/pnas.1704640114,10.1074/jbc.ra118.005914}. With the knowledge of binding constants for each of the three degraders, the assays were designed to optimize the complex formation of 80\% or greater in the D2O labeling solution after the 1:13 dilution (94\% ACBI1, 93\% PROTAC 2, 89\% PROTAC 1) to obtain maximal exchange of the ternary complexes. Maximizing complex formation in solution ensures that the ratio of liganded to free protein in solution does not complicate the downstream analysis~\cite{Kochert2018}.  HDX experiments were performed using a protein stock at the initial concentration of 200 $\mathrm{\mu}$M of SMARCA2$^BD$, VCB in the APO, binary (200 $\mathrm{\mu}$M PROTAC ACBI1) and ternary (200 $\mathrm{\mu}$M PROTAC ACBI1) states in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 2\% DMSO in H2O. The protein samples were injected into the nanoACQUITY system equipped with HDX technology for UPLC separation (Waters Corp.~\cite{10.1021/ac8008862}) to generate mapping experiments used to assess sequence coverage. Generated maps were used for all subsequent exchange experiments. HDX was performed by diluting the initial 200 $\mathrm{\mu}$M protein stock 13-fold with D2O (Cambridge Isotopes) containing buffer (10 mM phosphate, pD 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and incubated at 10 °C for various time points (0.5, 5, 30 min). At the designated time point, an aliquot from the exchanging experiment was sampled and diluted 1:13 into D2O quenching buffer containing (100 mM phosphate, pH 2.1, 50 mM NaCl, 3M GuHCl) at 1 °C. The process was repeated at all time points, including for non-deuterated samples in H2O-containing buffers. Quenched samples were injected into a 5-$\mathrm{\mu}$m BEH 2.1 X 30-mm Enzymate-immobilized pepsin column (Waters Corp.) at 100 $\mathrm{\mu}$l/min in 0.1\% formic acid at 10 °C and then incubated for 4.5 min for on-column digestion. Peptides were collected at 0 °C on a C18 VanGuard trap column (1.7 $\mathrm{\mu}$m X 30 mm) (Waters Corp.) for desalting with 0.1\% formic acid in H2O and then subsequently separated with an in-line 1.8µMHss T3 C18 2.1 X 30-mm nanoACQUITY UPLC column (Waters Corp.) for a 10-min gradient ranging from 0.1\% formic acid to acetonitrile (7 min, 5–35\%; 1 min, 35–85\%; 2 min hold 85\% acetonitrile) at 40 $\mathrm{\mu}$l/min at 0 °C. Fragments were mass-analyzed using the Synapt G2Si ESL-Q-ToF mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.). Between injections, a pepsin-wash step was performed to minimize peptide carryover.

### Data Protocol
Mass and collision-induced dissociation in data-independent acquisition mode (MSE) and ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) version 3.0 software (Waters Corp.) were used to identify the peptides in the non-deuterated mapping experiments and analyzed in the same fashion as HDX experiments. Mapping experiments generated from PLGS were imported into the DynamX version 3.0 (Waters Corp.) with quality thresholds of MS1 signal intensity of 5000, maximum sequence length of 25 amino acids, minimum products 2.0, minimum products per amino acid of 0.3, minimum PLGS score of 6.0. Automated results were inspected manually to ensure the corresponding m/z and isotopic distributions at various charge states were assigned to the corresponding peptides in all proteins (SMARCA2$^BD$, VHL, ElonC, ElonB). DynamX was utilized to generate the relative deuterium incorporation plots and HDX heat map for each peptide (see supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:coverage_SM}) of each protein within the complex and stable deuterium exchange (see supplementary Figs.~\ref{fig:smc2_heat_map_SM}-\ref{fig:elob_heat_map_SM}). The relative deuterium uptake of common peptides was determined by subtracting the weighted-average mass of the centroid of the non-deuterated control samples from the deuterated samples at each time point. All experiments were made under the same experimental conditions negating the need for back-exchange calculations but therefore are reported as relative~\cite{10.1002/mas.20064}. All HDX experiments were performed twice, on 2 separate days, and a 98 and 95\% confidence limit of uncertainty was applied to calculate the mean relative deuterium uptake of each data set. Mean relative deuterium uptake thresholds were calculated as described previously~\cite{10.1074/jbc.m116.773499,10.1073/pnas.1704640114,10.1074/jbc.ra118.005914}. Differences in deuterium uptake that exceeded the error of the datasets were considered significant.
