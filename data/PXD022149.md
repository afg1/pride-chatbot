### Title
Ceragenins and antimicrobial peptides kill bacteria through distinct mechanisms

### Description
Ceragenins are a family of synthetic amphipathic molecules designed to mimic the properties of naturally-occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Although ceragenins have potent antimicrobial activity, whether their mode of action is similar to that of CAMPs has remained elusive. Here we report the results of a comparative study of the bacterial responses to two well-studied CAMPs, LL37 and colistin, and two ceragenins with related structures, CSA13 and CSA13.

### Sample Protocol
Bacterial cultures were treated with antibiotics, proteins were extracted, digested with tyrtypsin, and desalted over C18 cartridges. 10 micrograms of desalted peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.

### Data Protocol
Mass spectrometry data was analyzed with MaxQuant and statistical analysis performed with the MSStats Bioconductor package and artMS version 0.9.
