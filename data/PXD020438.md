### Title
Optimization of label-free nano LC-MS/MS analysis of the placental proteome

### Description
We optimized a protocol to analyze the placental proteome by means of label-free nano-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry with regard to sample treatment, protein extraction, and protein digestion, in order to obtain a high protein concentration for identification of a specific protein signature according to the conditions studied.

### Sample Protocol
Sample collection Placental tissue samples were collected from the ongoing ENVIRONAGE (ENVIRonmental influence ON AGEing in early life) birth cohort. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committees of Hasselt University and East-Limburg Hospital (EudraCT B37120107805). Before delivery, an informed consent form was signed by the mothers, and placentas were collected within 10 min after birth. The samples were taken at the fetal side of the placenta and were either directly frozen in liquid nitrogen or rinsed shortly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before freezing. The biopsies were kept at -80°C until protein extraction.  Protein extraction Proteins were extracted from approximately 200 mg placental tissue in 1.5 ml lysis buffer containing 2M thiourea, 7M urea, 2% CHAPS, and 2% dithiothreitol (DTT). Four tissue disruption methods were tested: by using a syringe (VWR, Pennsylvanian USA), by three subsequent 10-sec sonication bursts (UP100H, Hielscher, Teltow, Germany), by mechanical disruption with an Ultra Turrax T8 mixer (IKA, Staufen, Germany) three times during 10 sec, or by crushing the tissue in liquid nitrogen. The lysates were incubated on a shaking plate for 30 min at 1400 rpm and 15 °C and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 16.000 g. Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).  Trypsin digestion and detergent removal Protein precipitation and liquid digestion  Protein extracts were treated with the 2-D Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Illinois, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 0.2% Rapigest (Waters, Massachusetts, USA), incubated at 15°C for 30 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 g, heated for 5 min at 100°C and finally kept at -80°C. Samples were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and shaken at 500 rpm for 45 min at 37°C, then, alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark under the same conditions. After adding 1 mM CaCl2 and trypsin in a ratio of 1/50 w/w, protein digestion occurred overnight, shaking at 300 rpm and 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Biosolve) and incubating for 45 min at 300 rpm and 37°C. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was used for nano LC-MS/MS analysis. Liquid digestion with the FASP kit Samples were digested using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) digestion, based on modified protocols of the FASP Protein Digestion kit (Expedeon, San Diego, USA) [8,9]. We used 10 µg of protein input, and protein digestion was performed with either 1/20 or 1/50 w/w trypsin, for either 2 hours, 5 hours, or overnight at 37°C and 300 rpm. Following final centrifugation during 10 min at 13,000 g, the digestion was stopped with 2% TFA, after which the peptide mixture was directly analyzed with nano LC-MS/MS. In-gel digestion Five µl of loading buffer was added to 20 µg of protein sample. This mixture was heated at 100°C for 5 min, centrifuged during 2 min at 13,000 rpm and subsequently loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Biorad, California, USA). Following a run of 5 min at 200 V and 400 mA, the gel containing proteins was cut into pieces of ± 5-6 mm³ and kept in H2O at -20°C prior to trypsin digestion. Gel fragments were dehydrated with acetonitrile (ACN), shaking 10 min at 900 rpm. After ACN removal, reduction and alkylation of the in-gel protein samples were performed similar to that of the liquid digestion protocol, by incubation with 10 mM DTT and 55 mM IAA. Following two incubation steps with ACN and one with 100 mM NH4HCO3, the in-gel protein mixtures were digested with trypsin at a final concentration of 6.25 ng/µl, overnight at 37°C and 300 rpm.  Nano LC-MS/MS We analyzed the peptide samples with a nano-liquid chromatography Ultimate 3000 system (Thermo Scientific), connected to a maXis Impact electrospray Ultra-High resolution Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Massachusetts, USA). Initial peptide separation occurred by reverse-phase liquid chromatography on a 75 µm by 250 mm C18 column (Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 LC Column, Thermo Scientific). Mobile phase A in this column was composed of 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile, mobile phase B contained 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. For each run, 2 µg of sample was injected, and the organic concentration of the mobile phase was increased linearly from 4 % to 35 %. We used a 90 min gradient for in-gel digestion and one of 215 min for other strategies. Subsequently, the resulting flow-through was ionized in the electrospray ionization (ESI) CaptiveSpray (Bruker), which was directly coupled to the C18 column. In survey scan, MS spectra were acquired for 0.5 s in a 50 to 2200 m/z range.

### Data Protocol
Peak lists were created using the DataAnalysis 4.0 software (Bruker) and uploaded to the ProteinScape 3.1 software (Bruker) which uses Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science) as protein identifier search engine, through the UNIPROT database (version September 2019, Uniprot-HomoIsoform 190904). Finally, we used the Scaffold 4.8 software (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, Oregon, USA) to visualize the protein identification lists. For the total number of identified proteins, we set the protein and peptide threshold at 1.0% false discovery rate (FDR), and the minimum number of peptides for identification at two.

### Publication Abstract
The placenta can be regarded as a mirror of the events to which the fetus is exposed during development. The placental proteome has been studied with several methodologies differing in sample handling, protein extraction, and processing. We optimized a protocol to analyze the placental proteome by means of label-free nano-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry with regard to sample treatment, protein extraction, and protein digestion, in order to obtain a high protein concentration for identification of a specific protein signature according to the conditions studied. We recommend mechanical tissue disruption, blood removal prior to protein extraction, and FASP-based or in-gel digestion.
